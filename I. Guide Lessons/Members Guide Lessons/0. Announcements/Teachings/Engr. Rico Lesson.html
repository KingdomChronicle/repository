    Life Lessons from the Story of Jonah: <br><br>
    
    <b>Title: Answering God’s Call to Serve and Be His Instrument on Earth</b><br><br>


    The story of Jonah is one of the most powerful accounts in the Bible, illustrating God’s mercy, the consequences of disobedience, and the importance of answering His call. Jonah’s journey teaches us about God’s sovereignty, His desire for repentance, and our responsibility to obey His will.<br><br>



    <b>1. We Cannot Run from God’s Call</b><br><br>

    Jonah 1:1-3 – "The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai: 'Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me.' But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish."<br><br>


    Lesson:<br><br>

    1. Instead of resisting God's will, we should embrace His calling with faith.<br><br>


    2. Avoiding His purpose for our lives only brings unnecessary struggles.<br><br>



    <b>2. God Disciplines Those He Loves</b><br><br>

    Jonah 1:17 – "Now the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights."<br><br>

    Jonah’s time inside the fish was a form of discipline, but also an act of mercy. Instead of letting him perish in the sea, God gave him time to reflect and repent.<br><br>


    Lesson:<br><br>

    1. When we stray from God’s path, He disciplines us—not to destroy us, but to bring us back to Him.<br><br>


    2. God allows hardships to redirect us toward Him.<br><br>


    3. God allows struggles for those He loves to strengthen and refine them.<br><br>


    <b>3. Repentance Restores Our Calling </b><br><br>

    Jonah 2:1-2 – "From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God. He said: 'In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me.'"<br><br>

    Lesson:<br><br>

    1. When we recognize our mistakes and turn back to Him, He restores us and gives us another chance to fulfill our purpose.<br><br>

    2. No matter how far we have fallen, God is always ready to restore us when we sincerely repent.<br><br>



    <b>4. Our Obedience Can Save Others</b><br><br>

    Jonah 3:4-5 – "Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming, 'Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.' The Ninevites believed God."<br><br>

    Lesson:<br><br>

    1. Our calling is not just about us; it affects the lives of those around us. When we obey, we become instruments of God’s grace to others.<br><br>

    2. This shows the power of obedience—our faithfulness to God can lead others to salvation.<br><br>


    <b>5. God's Mercy is for All People</b> <br><br>

    Jonah 4:2 – "I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity."<br><br>

    Lesson:<br><br>

    1. We must not limit God’s grace. Instead of being judgmental, we should share His love with everyone, just as He has been merciful to us.<br><br>

    2. Jonah was angry that God forgave Nineveh, but this reveals a crucial lesson: God's mercy extends to all, even those we may think are undeserving.<br><br>


    <b>6. Final Challenge: Will You Answer God’s Call?</b><br><br>

    Jonah’s story teaches us that running from God leads to hardship, but obedience brings transformation—not only in our lives but in the lives of others.<br><br>

    Each of us has a calling to serve God—whether through preaching, helping others, or supporting the Kingdom of God.<br><br>

    <b>Will you answer God’s call today? </b><br><br>

    Isaiah 6:8 – "Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?' And I said, 'Here am I. Send me!'"<br><br>

    <b><i>May we be willing and ready to say, 
    "Here I am, Lord. Use me for Your glory."</i></b>

    Life Lessons from the Story of Jonah: <br><br>
    
    <b>Title: Answering God’s Call to Serve and Be His Instrument on Earth</b><br><br>

    
    The story of Jonah is one of the most powerful accounts in the Bible, illustrating God’s mercy, the consequences of disobedience, and the importance of answering His call. Jonah’s journey teaches us about God’s sovereignty, His desire for repentance, and our responsibility to obey His will.<br><br>


    <b>1. We Cannot Run from God’s Call</b><br><br>

    Jonah 1:1-3 – "The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai: 'Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me.' But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish."<br><br>

    <i>
    Jonah was called by God to preach repentance to Nineveh.<br><br>

    As a prophet, Jonah was like a special messenger for God. God instructed him to go to the great city of Nineveh and warn the people to turn away from their wickedness. However, Jonah did not want to obey—so he ran in the opposite direction instead!<br><br>

    Why?<br><br>

    A Short Review of Nineveh:<br><br>

    In 722 BC, the Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom of Israel, leading to its downfall. Many Israelites were taken into captivity, causing immense suffering and the scattering of the northern tribes.<br><br>

    Even the southern kingdom of Judah faced threats and pressure from the Assyrians.<br><br>

    The Assyrian empire, with Nineveh as its capital, was known for its extreme violence, and the Israelites were among the many people who suffered under their rule.<br><br>


    In simple terms, Nineveh represented a powerful and violent empire that had caused great pain and suffering to the Israelites.<br><br>

    From a human perspective, Jonah had a valid reason to refuse God’s command to preach in Nineveh.<br><br>

    So, he did something irrational—he ran away in the opposite direction!<br><br>

    Similarly, in my own life, when God first called me to serve Him through the Kingdom of God, I stopped because my family was greatly affected, and it seemed like there was no peace. In the middle of it all, I stepped away.<br><br>

    But why am I standing before you now? I am an engineer. I was once a person with many vices and faults—someone who, by human standards, might not seem worthy to stand before you today to glorify God and testify to His goodness in my life.<br><br>

    This reminds us that when God calls us to serve Him, we cannot run or hide.<br><br>

    Ignoring His call leads to difficulties, just as Jonah faced a storm and was swallowed by a great fish.<br><br>
</i>

    Lesson:<br><br>

    1. Instead of resisting God's will, we should embrace His calling with faith.<br><br>


    2. Avoiding His purpose for our lives only brings unnecessary struggles.<br><br>



    <b>2. God Disciplines Those He Loves</b><br><br>

    Jonah 1:17 – "Now the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights."<br><br>

    Jonah’s time inside the fish was a form of discipline, but also an act of mercy. Instead of letting him perish in the sea, God gave him time to reflect and repent.<br><br>


    Lesson:<br><br>

    1. When we stray from God’s path, He disciplines us—not to destroy us, but to bring us back to Him.<br><br>


    2. God allows hardships to redirect us toward Him.<br><br>


    3. God allows struggles for those He loves to strengthen and refine them.<br><br>


<i>
    I did not know God deeply before. I would go to church, but my heart always carried a desire to serve Him—especially by helping those in need.<br><br>

    When I discovered this program, I gave everything—my effort, time, and money—because back then, the Kingdom program was still in its early stages. There was no clear direction, and we were among the first to step into this calling. People thought we were crazy because only we understood our mission.<br><br>

    As a result, many people—especially those who knew us personally—accused us of being delusional.<br><br>

    In short, I sacrificed a lot to support the mission of the Kingdom, even providing financial assistance to help establish the program.<br><br>

    However, my financial support led me into deep debt due to numerous loans, and eventually, my entire family opposed me.<br><br>

    Because of the overwhelming pressure and to avoid further conflict with my family, I withdrew from the program. But even when I was no longer involved, the calling of God never left my heart.<br><br>

    The voice in my heart urging me to serve God—the Creator of heaven and earth—never faded.<br><br>

    This led me to the third lesson from Jonah’s story.<br><br>
</i>



    <b>3. Repentance Restores Our Calling</b><br><br>

    Jonah 2:1-2 – "From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God. He said: 'In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me.'"<br><br>

    <i>
    Inside the fish, Jonah repented and cried out to God.<br><br>

    I, too, prayed and wept before God, saying, "Lord, everything I do is for You. Please forgive me for stepping away from my calling."<br><br>

    So, I returned and listened even more closely to His voice to become one to proclaim the Kingdom of God.<br><br>

    First, at the Kingdom Proclamation in Quirino.<br><br>

    Then, at the Kingdom Proclamation in Kiangan.<br><br>

    Even when I faced threats to stop following my calling, I remained steadfast in serving God.<br><br>
</i>

    Lesson:<br><br>

    1. When we recognize our mistakes and turn back to Him, He restores us and gives us another chance to fulfill our purpose.<br><br>


    2. No matter how far we have fallen, God is always ready to restore us when we sincerely repent.<br><br>



    <b>4. Our Obedience Can Save Others</b><br><br>

    Jonah 3:4-5 – "Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming, 'Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.' The Ninevites believed God."<br><br>

    <i>
    When Jonah finally obeyed God and preached in Nineveh, the entire city repented and was spared from destruction.<br><br>

    I believe that God is calling us to serve in His Kingdom so that many will be saved—especially our nation—from the coming judgment due to sin.<br><br>

    Through the Kingdom of God, we must proclaim the Good News of His reign so that our country may be spared from divine wrath in these last days.<br><br>

    If you love your country, your family, and those around you, let us work together in His Kingdom and become instruments of His salvation.<br><br>
</i>

    Lesson:<br><br>

    1. Our calling is not just about us; it affects the lives of those around us. When we obey, we become instruments of God’s grace to others.<br><br>


    2. This shows the power of obedience—our faithfulness to God can lead others to salvation.<br><br>


    <b>5. God's Mercy is for All People</b><br><br>

    Jonah 4:2 – "I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity."<br><br>

    Lesson:<br><br>

    1. We must not limit God’s grace. Instead of being judgmental, we should share His love with everyone, just as He has been merciful to us.<br><br>


    2. Jonah was angry that God forgave Nineveh, but this reveals a crucial lesson: God's mercy extends to all, even those we may think are undeserving.<br><br>


    <i>
    Let us proclaim the Good News of God’s reign—the Kingdom of God—because everyone deserves to hear it. It is up to them whether they remain in darkness and await God's wrath or turn to Him and accept His rule in their hearts and lives.<br><br>
</i>


    <b>6. Final Challenge: Will You Answer God’s Call?</b><br><br>
