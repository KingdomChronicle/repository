        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The First Bearer of the Title</b></p>

        <p>
            The first person to hold this title was my brother, King Bernardo Carpio, who, according to historical accounts remembered by the elders associated with Mariang Alimango or Banahaw, was born on January 16, 945, in Barangay Abulalas, Hagonoy, Bulacan.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h4>Part 6</h4>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Blessing of Abulalas</b></p>

        <p>
            We blessed that place in Hagonoy, Bulacan, making Abulalas historically significant in the world's history. We named it "Abulalas," meaning: <br><br>

            "Bulacan is the Root of the Humble Race, yet Always Busy and Abundant."            
        </p>

        <h4>Part 10</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Honest Trade of the Past</b></p>

        <p>
            Before the Mongolian invasions, our country engaged in honest and orderly trade with various foreign nations, including Arabs, Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, and Indians from India.
        </p>

        <h4>Part 11</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Desire of Some Foreigners for the Marias</b></p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, some foreigners not only saw the wealth of our land but also coveted the unparalleled beauty of the Marias and our true wives in spiritual power and in accordance with the will of God the Father.
        </p>

        <h4>Part 12</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Offering of the “Alpha Omega Ring”</b></p>

        <p>
            Driven by their strong desires, they attempted to present our nation with tokens, including a special ring adorned with twelve small diamonds and a large central diamond, known as the “Alpha Omega Ring.”<br><br>

            This ring symbolizes the deposit of Adam, who was also King David, as revealed to me by the Great Father before my passing.<br><br>
            
            This ring was offered as a substitute for their desire for our true wives.            
        </p>


        
        <h4>Part 13</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Demand for Compensation and King Carpio’s Objection</b></p>

        <p>
            As time passed, the moment came when they sought to claim the Marias as compensation for the tokens they had bestowed upon our country. <br><br>

            Thus, they also demanded something in return for what they had given.<br><br>

            At this point, King Carpio objected, leading them to attempt to reclaim the gifts they had previously offered.
        </p>

        <h4>Part 14</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>King Carpio’s Agreement</b></p>

        <p>
            Because of this, King Carpio devised a way to lend them the tokens instead, believing that: <br><br>
            A given gift remains a gift and cannot be taken back.<br><br>
            Especially if there is an agreement stating it can only be retrieved in the proper manner.<br><br>
            To avoid conflict, King Carpio established a new agreement:<br><br>
            Foreigners would be loaned an item by the country.<br><br>
            They must repay it double the value of what they took from us.

        <ul>
            <li>Their primary target was the Marias, as they sought revenge against King Carpio.

        </ul>

        <h4>Part 23</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Barrier of the Clashing Rocks in Sierra Madre</b></p>

        <p>
            The attempted invasion was hindered by the clashing rocks in the Sierra Madre Mountains in Montalban, Rizal.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>However, these rocks could potentially submerge the country if they were not stopped.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h4>Part 24</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Conflict Between the Evil Enchanters</b></p>

        <p>
            The continued movement of the clashing rocks was caused by a rivalry between two malevolent enchanters: Aruku (in the material form of Ignacio Enrique Coronado) and Pinuku (in the material form of Judge Alfonso Pijao).
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>They were envious of each other and fought over their desire for Maria Cristina, who was not only beautiful but also had a curvaceous body and large bosom.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h4>Part 25</h4>

            Maria Cristina intervened to stop the clashing rocks, which were being pushed by the evil enchanters in an attempt to submerge the Philippines.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>However, our Heavenly Father prevented this disaster.

        <p>
            To save the country, King Carpio sacrificed his life.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>In response, Mariang Banahaw or Alimango (in the material form of Datu Daliktuna) placed gold between the clashing rocks in Montalban.</li>
            <li>The three other Marias also used their powers as Enchanted Queens and angels, alongside other fairies and enchantresses, to prevent King Carpio from being completely crushed.</li>
        </ul>

            Despite their efforts, King Carpio perished, becoming a forgotten figure in Philippine history.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Before his death, he entrusted the stewardship of God the Father’s blessings to Mariang Alimango.</li>
            <li>He instructed that the role of guardian over these blessings should be given to one of the four of them, as chosen by the Father in the future.

        </ul>

        <h4>Part 28</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Forgotten Act of Seeking Forgiveness</b></p>

        <p>
            Bernardo Carpio died without Mariang Banahaw being able to ask for his forgiveness.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>This was due to the persecution that his brother suffered at the hands of Israel’s enemies or the Palestinians, because of Mariang Banahaw or Alimango.</li>
        </ul>


        <h4>Part 29</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Mongol Invasions (1001–1294)</b></p>

        <p>
            The Mongol conquests took place across different parts of the world from 1001 to 1294. <br><br>

            During this time, Maria Alimango or Banahaw kept the document detailing the Mongols’ debt to the Philippines.<br><br>

            Since they failed to retrieve it, the Filipinos became rightful heirs to a share of the wealth plundered by the Mongols.
        </p>


        <h4>Part 30</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Cooperation of the Enchanted Ones Ami d Hardship</b></p>

        <p>
            A period of extreme hardship fell upon the Filipino people, leading the enchanted siblings to unite in helping the nation. <br><br>

            At that time, only Mariang Alimango and Maria Cristina had physical bodies.<br><br>

            Maria Cristina safeguarded a special map created by King Carpio, which contained the layout of the Philippine lands.<br><br>

        </p>


        <h4>Part 31</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The End of the Mongol Conquests and the Beginning of European Exploration</b></p>

        <p>
            After the Mongols had conquered much of the world, the Europeans began exploring new lands. One of these nations was Spain, which sailed across the seas, reaching various parts of the Americas before eventually arriving in the Philippines.
        </p>


        <h4>Part 32</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Arrival of Europeans in the Philippines (1521)</b></p>

        <p>
            The first European to set foot in the Philippines was Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer serving under Spain. He arrived on the island of Mactan, Cebu, on March 16, 1521. However, in a battle, he was killed by the warriors of Datu Lapu-Lapu.
        </p>


        <h4>Part 33</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Spanish Colonization (1565)</b></p>

        <p>
            After Magellan’s death, the Spaniards returned to the Philippines. On March 16, 1565, Miguel López de Legazpi arrived and established Spain’s permanent rule over the country. From then on, Datu Lapu-Lapu’s presence faded from historical records, and the long era of Spanish colonialism began.
        </p>


        <h4>Part 34</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Transfer of Wealth from Carpio to Lapu-Lapu</b></p>

        <p>
            Some of the wealth left behind by Carpio fell into the hands of Lapu-Lapu, but before long, he mysteriously vanished. Afterward, portions of the treasure, including a map, were passed on to Datu Si-Katuna and Datu Si-Gala of Bohol.
        </p>


        <h4>Part 35</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Legazpi’s Attempt to Seize the Wealth</b></p>

        <p>
            Upon learning of this treasure, Miguel López de Legazpi sought to acquire it, along with the map. Some of Lapu-Lapu’s men offered part of the treasure to the Spaniards, which they then used to “purchase” the Philippines. This wealth, originally intended by Carpio for the Filipino people, ended up in the hands of foreign rulers.
        </p>


        <h4>Part 36</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Curse of Datu Ahmad Sallo (King David)</b></p>

        <p>
            During this period, Datu Ahmad Sallo—believed to be the material embodiment of King David—appeared as an elderly man. He placed a curse upon the new foreign invaders, declaring that they would have to pay a price if they oppressed the Filipino people.
        </p>


        <h4>Part 37</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Transfer of the Map and Wealth to Spain</b></p>

        <p>
            The map and a portion of the Filipino wealth safeguarded by Carpio were taken to Spain and fell into the possession of King Philip II. As a result, the country was named after him, and the Philippines was included under "Titulo de Propriedad Numero 4136," covering the lands from northern Batanes to southern Sabah.
        </p>


        <h4>Part 38</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Eastern Europe’s Acquisition of Mongol Wealth</b></p>

        <p>
            After the Mongols abandoned the treasures they had looted from conquered lands, these riches ended up in the hands of Eastern Europeans and were later traded. Western Europeans, unaware of the origins of these treasures, unknowingly benefited from the wealth that was originally owed by the Mongols to the Filipinos.
        </p>


        <h4>Part 39</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Beginning of Spanish Oppression in the Philippines</b></p>

        <p>
            With the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, oppression and exploitation of Filipinos began. Many were enslaved and suffered immense hardships under the rule of foreign conquerors.

        <p>
            Queen Elizabeth I of England acknowledged that the wealth used by Western Europe originated from Eastern Europe, specifically from the Mongols' abandoned treasures. The funds that enabled Western European powers to expand their empires were linked to the memories and riches left behind by Carpio. Even the wealth used by the Spaniards to "buy" the Philippines had connections to Carpio, facilitated by some Filipinos who had lost their sense of national pride.

            During the war between Filipinos and Spaniards, the Americans arrived in the Philippines. However, their intervention was merely a deception, as they had already reached an agreement with Spain under the Treaty of Paris, signed on December 10, 1898. In this treaty, Spain transferred its authority and assets to the United States for $20,000,000. <br><br>

            The treaty was linked to Título de Propiedad No. 4136, which had originated during the reign of King Philip II of Spain. The Americans discovered that Dr. Jose Rizal’s signature was on the title, prompting them to search for a copy of the document to establish full control over the Philippines.

            Because of this, General Emilio Aguinaldo, also known as Judge Alfonso Pijao and the father of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, took drastic measures to seize the title from Bonifacio. As a result, on May 10, 1897, Aguinaldo’s group executed Bonifacio in Maragondon, Cavite, securing the title for themselves.

Many nations became involved in the war and agreed to divide these riches without the knowledge or consent of the Filipinos, who were the rightful owners of these assets. <br><br>

            However, this agreement failed because the influence of Coronado’s son, Adolf Hitler, grew stronger, and he began spreading terror across the world.

            Meanwhile, Hitler massacred millions of people, particularly Jews, during his reign of terror. As a result, the Allied Forces united to fight the Axis Powers, which were attempting to smuggle these riches.

            However, during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines from 1942 to 1945, the Americans abandoned the country along with their prized Land Title of the Philippines, which the Japanese burned. When the Americans returned to the Philippines, the titles were gone, so they merely granted the country its independence in words.

            In the end, the International Court ruled that whoever discovered the treasure had the right to own it, but it must be used for the benefit of the people of that nation.

            Due to the greed of Queen Elizabeth II, Alfonso Pijao, Enrique Coronado, Patricia Remedios S. Trinidad (who impersonated Imelda Marcos), and other global elites, they used these wealth reserves while they were still under time-based growth investments.

            I once saw Leticia Tonog Galang, known as the "Sword of Lucifer or Satan," whom I had my soldiers in Barangay Atlag, Malolos, Bulacan, keep under surveillance. She was a healer who possessed powers granted by demons, and her presence coincided with a series of calamities that struck our country—disasters caused by these dark forces. Yet, she had the audacity to blame me for these events.

        <p>
            The Holy Father rejected such a self-sacrifice to demons, declaring that adultery could never be considered an act of devotion or offering of one’s life. As a result, Barangay Atlag was labeled with the decree: "The Sword of Lucifer Must Be Removed from Its Role."

            During my visit to England, I stood before Queen Elizabeth II to finalize agreements regarding the rightful allocation of wealth should it ever be claimed by the people.

            The $40,000,000 loaned by the World Bank to Pijao was originally designated for the Filipino people. However, due to greed, they have persistently sought to tarnish my name. In time, they will also attempt to ruin Martin’s name once he becomes aware of his divine authority.

        <p>

        <h4>Part 114</h4>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The True Masterminds Behind Ninoy’s Assassination</b></p>

        <p>
            Ninoy’s assassination was carried out under the orders of Queen Elizabeth II. The real conspirators behind his tragic death were President Ronald Reagan and Judge Alfonso Pijao. Their main goal was to prevent the release of even a fraction of the wealth’s earnings, fearing that their own nations would collapse once the Filipino people claimed their rightful share.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before stepping down, I warned the nation that the country would eventually rise again. However, before that happens, it would first experience: <br><br>

            Widespread deception by those falsely claiming to be my children and relatives.<br><br>
            
            Rampant corruption and exploitation of innocent citizens.<br><br>

        <p>
            Because of these injustices, it is not the guilty but the Filipino people who will suffer. Especially now that laws in the Philippines prohibit revealing the truth about these funds. This will lead to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A massive exodus of Filipinos seeking work abroad, essentially becoming modern-day slaves.</li><br>
            <li>Hardship and struggle, despite the fact that their wages come from the very wealth meant for them.</li><br>
