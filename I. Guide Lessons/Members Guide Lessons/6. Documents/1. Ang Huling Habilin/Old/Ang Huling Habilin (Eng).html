        <h4>Part 1</h4>
        <p><b>Be it known to all Filipino People,</b> <br></p>
        <p>
        I, Ferdinand Edralin Marcos, known by the code AAA-777 and White Spiritual Eagle, of legal age, husband of Mrs. Imelda Romualdez Marcos, former President of the Islands of the Philippines, and guardian of the blessings of God the Father, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, declare that I will transfer the records written in imperfect English to ANTHONY SANTIAGO MARTIN. <br><br>

        I openly affirm the truth about the events concerning my real status and the true nature of the blessings of the Almighty Father.</p>
        <br><br>


        <h4>Part 2</h4>
        <p>
        The first to possess this trait was my brother, King Bernardo Carpio, who, according to history remembered by the elders who were companions of Mariang Alimango or Banahaw in ancient times, was born on January 16, 945, in Barangay Abulalas, Hagonoy, Bulacan. <br><br>

        The four of us, as siblings, were created by the Father in another realm—the World of Gold—to carry out His blessings. We gathered in Abulalas, where King Carpio was in physical form while the three of us existed in spiritual power. Together, we blessed that place in Hagonoy, Bulacan, declaring that Abulalas would hold historical significance in the world’s history.<br><br>
        
        We, the four, named it "Abulalas," meaning "Bulacan is the root of a humble race yet always busy and abundant." This includes Bernardo Carpio, also known as Judge Samson; Dr. Jose Protacio Rizal, also recognized as the prophet Moses; myself, as King Solomon; and Anthony Santiago Martin, who played the role of the young Carpio or King David.</p><br><br>


        <h4>Part 3</h4>
        <p>
        Our female companions were: <br><br>

        Mariang Banahaw, also known as Alimango or Delilah, the Enchanted Queen and fairy guardian of Mount Banahaw, located in the province of Quezon.<br><br>
        
        Mariang Sinukuan, also known as Santa Maria, the Enchanted Queen and fairy guardian of Mount Sinukuan, located in the province of Pampanga.<br><br>
        
        Maria Makiling, also known as Queen Esther, the Enchanted Queen and fairy guardian of Mount Makiling, located in the province of Laguna.<br><br>
        
        Lyn Grace H. Medina-Martin, whom I recognize as Mariang Cristina or Bathsheba, the Enchanted Queen and fairy guardian of Mount Kanlaon, located in the province of Negros Occidental. She once played the role of Salma Hassan, and when Hassan’s physical body passed away, Maria Cristina's power was manifested through Malekta Bali. <br><br>
        
        <h4>Part 4</h4>
        <p>
        In the past, before the Mongols invaded, our country engaged in honest and orderly trade with Arabs, Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, and Indians. However, some foreigners became captivated by the unparalleled beauty of the Marias I mentioned and our wives, who were bound to us by spiritual power and the will of God the Father.<br><br>

        These foreigners sought to offer gifts to our land, including a ring adorned with twelve small diamonds and a large central diamond—known as the "Alpha Omega Ring." This ring symbolized the deposit of Adam, who was also King David, according to the sign that the Almighty Father reminded me of before I passed away.<br><br>
        
        Their desires for our true wives grew stronger, and eventually, they sought to take the Marias in exchange for the gifts they had given. When the time came for them to claim what they believed was their due, King Carpio opposed their demands. As a result, they insisted on taking back the gifts they had bestowed upon the country.<br><br>
        
        To resolve the matter, King Carpio decided to offer these gifts as a loan rather than allowing them to be taken back. Since a given gift should remain given—especially when an agreement was made stating it could not be reclaimed—he devised a new arrangement. To prevent conflict within the nation, he established a treaty stating that any foreigner borrowing an item from our land must repay it with double the value of what was taken.</p> <br><br>


        <h4>Part 5</h4>
        <p>
        Years passed, and the foreigners eventually learned about this agreement through Datu Allum, who had sided with the Mongols. He explained the contents of the document created by King Carpio, which led the Mongols and their allied foreign forces to attempt to conquer our land, especially to take the Marias, in revenge against King Carpio. <br><br>

        However, the clashing rocks of the Sierra Madre Mountains in Montalban, now part of the province of Rizal, became a formidable barrier against their invasion. But these same rocks also posed a great danger to our country, as their movement threatened to sink the land. This was caused by the conflict and jealousy between the wicked enchanted beings—Aruku, who took material form as Ignacio Enrique Coronado, and Pinuku, who was embodied in Judge Alfonso Pijao. Their rivalry and obsession over the Marias, particularly Maria Cristina, led to this struggle. Maria Cristina, admired not only for her beauty but also for her well-formed, curvaceous figure and full bosom, stood between them as they tried to unleash destruction upon the land.<br><br>

        To prevent the catastrophe, our Heavenly Father intervened. King Carpio then sacrificed his life to save the nation. In response, Mariang Banahaw, also known as Alimango, who had taken the material form of Datu Daliktuna, placed gold between the clashing rocks. The three other Marias also aided in reinforcing the barrier by adding more gold through their power as Enchanted Queens and angels, assisted by other enchanted beings and fairies. Their efforts ensured that King Carpio, who possessed the strongest enchanted and angelic power among all of God’s creations, would not be crushed by the rocks.<br><br>

        Unfortunately, despite these efforts, King Carpio perished—a figure forgotten in Philippine history. Before he died, he entrusted the guardianship of God's blessings to Mariang Alimango. He instructed that these blessings should be passed on, in the future, to one of the four of them, as chosen by the Father.<br><br>

        King Bernardo Carpio died without receiving forgiveness from Mariang Banahaw. This was because he suffered persecution at the hands of Israel’s enemies at the time—the Philistines—due to Mariang Banahaw, also known as Alimango.</p><br><br>
        
        <h4>Part 6</h4>
        <p>
        And so, the events unfolded. From the year 965 to 1000, the Mongols began their conquest of many lands across the world, which lasted from 1001 to 1294. In their expansion, they had forgotten to retrieve the document that recorded their debt to our nation—a record safeguarded by Maria Alimango or Banahaw. Because of this, even the wealth they had acquired was still partially owed to the people of the Philippines.<br><br>

        As time passed, hardship struck the Filipino people, and to help them survive, the enchanted siblings worked together. During this time of suffering, only Mariang Alimango and Maria Cristina had physical bodies. Maria Cristina managed to preserve an ancient map made of paper, created by King Carpio himself, which outlined the land divisions of the Philippines.<br><br>
        
        Even after the Mongols’ historic conquest of half the world, their debt to the Philippines remained unsettled. Eventually, European nations began to explore lands beyond their borders, with Spain being one of the countries leading these expeditions. Their search brought them to various parts of the Americas before they arrived in the Philippines.<br><br>
        
        The first European explorer to reach the Philippines was Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese navigator serving Spain, who landed on the island of Mactan in the province of Cebu on March 16, 1521. However, he was unfortunately killed by the warriors of Lapu-Lapu, the material embodiment of Carpio. Later, on March 16, 1565, Miguel López de Legazpi led a Spanish expedition into the country, marking the beginning of Spain’s colonization. With this, the presence of Datu Lapu-Lapu gradually faded into history.</p><br><br>
        
        <h4>Part 7</h4>
        <p>
        Some of Carpio's remaining wealth fell into the hands of Lapu-Lapu, but before long, it vanished like a bubble. Eventually, Datu Si-Katuna and Datu Si-Gala of the Province of Bohol came into possession of some of these riches, including a map. When Legazpi learned of this, he sought to acquire some of these treasures and the map.<br><br>

        Some of Lapu-Lapu’s men offered portions of these riches to the Spaniards, which led to the Spaniards purchasing the Philippines using the map and the wealth that Brother Carpio had set aside for the Filipinos. Eventually, Datu Ahmad Sallo, believed to be the material heir of King David, appeared in the form of an elderly man. He placed a curse upon the new foreign invaders of the Philippines, declaring that they, too, would have to pay the country if they ever oppressed the Filipinos.<br><br>
        
        The map and part of the Filipino treasures that Brother Carpio had kept were taken to Spain, where they quickly came into the possession of King Philip II of Spain. Because of this, the Philippines was named after King Philip II and placed under Titulo de Propriedad Numero 4136, covering an area extending from the northern borders of Batanes to the southern regions of Sabah.<br><br>
        
        When the Mongolians abandoned the wealth they had accumulated from the nations they conquered, this wealth was taken by the Eastern Europeans and traded among their people. This, in turn, sparked the interest of the Western Europeans, who sought to claim countless relics from the Mongolians—unaware that these treasures were actually debts owed by the Mongolians to the Filipino people. </p><br><br>
        
        <h4>Part 8</h4>
        <p>
        During this time, the Spaniards began their oppression and abuse of the Filipino people, enslaving, humiliating, and mistreating them. Eventually, Queen Elizabeth I of England revealed that the wealth used by Western Europe had been taken from Eastern Europe, left behind by the Mongolians. The funds that Western Europeans used for their expeditions and conquests came from the treasures left behind by Brother Carpio. It was also Carpio’s wealth that the Spaniards used, with the help of discontented Filipinos, to purchase the lands of the Philippines.<br><br>

        When the Spaniards colonized the Philippines, they discovered markings and signs within Carpio’s wealth, which they shared with their British allies. This led all of Europe to realize that the treasures left by the Mongolians in their conquered lands were, in fact, part of the Filipino wealth. Because of this, the British sought to take control of the Philippines, but the Spaniards had already claimed it. However, from 1762 to 1764, the British briefly occupied the Philippines and managed to collect some of Carpio’s treasures. They then transported a portion of these riches to America.<br><br>
        
        After the British withdrew, Spanish oppression resumed, leading to the emergence of Dr. José Protacio Rizal y Mercado, who was born on June 19, 1861. From a young age, Dr. Rizal endured immense suffering, a path later reflected in Anthony Santiago Martin, who was believed to have received the restored power from the Father. It was said that Dr. Rizal possessed a mysterious form with nine faces, and the young Rizal lived on as Antonio Santiago, the beloved of Graciana de los Santos, who was believed to be imbued with the spirit of Maria Cristina.</p><br><br>

        <h4>Part 9</h4>
        <p>
        The young Rizal, in the person of Antonio Santiago, endured much suffering at the hands of the oppressive Spaniards. The friars and his arrogant Spanish teachers often forced him to clean for them, scolded him for no reason, and ignored him in class even when he knew the answers. To get their attention, Santiago once walked in wooden clogs, but instead of noticing him kindly, they used the clogs to strike his head. Despite these hardships, Santiago endured everything for the sake of his love for Graciana.<br><br>

        The real Rizal was not highly fluent in Spanish, but through divine power, Santiago was able to teach him to read and write in the language. Rizal was also capable of speaking Mandarin, as his family had Chinese ancestry. After Santiago completed his long and difficult studies at the University of Santo Tomas, Dr. Rizal entrusted him with Graciana. However, Graciana’s parents were wealthy and arrogant, and they refused to accept Santiago because of his poverty. Their love story mirrored that of King David and Bathsheba, but unlike the biblical couple, Santiago was rejected.<br><br>
        
        On that fateful day, Santiago mysteriously disappeared, as Graciana’s influential Spanish family had the power to make people vanish. Graciana, heartbroken by his loss, journeyed alone to Mount Kanlaon, where she became the mystical queen of the fairies and enchantresses. There, she left behind a sacred relic for Dr. Rizal. At that time, Rizal was conversing with Maria Clara Del Prado, who was believed to embody the spirit of Maria Banahaw or Alimango. Graciana’s message also mentioned the need to recover the Cross of Christ, which was hidden in Bulacan by the Mongolian Emperor Guyuk Khan.<br><br>
        
        This cross, originally returned by King David in the form of Emperor Constantine of the Roman Empire, was taken from Rome to Israel. From there, it was seized by Genghis Khan and brought to Mongolia at the beginning of their conquests. The Mongols first invaded Muslim nations, and before Genghis Khan died, he successfully secured the cross within his empire. This relic was a symbol of the eternal love between King David and Bathsheba, which they had safeguarded in another realm since ancient times—before Satan and his demons rebelled against the Creator.<br><br>
        
        Dr. Rizal assured Graciana that they would reunite, if not in his lifetime, then in the future, as decreed by the Almighty. Graciana waited for Santiago’s return, but she eventually fell ill and passed away before Dr. Rizal left for Hong Kong. He traveled there to meet Emperor Guangxu of China, based on reports from his allies in British-controlled Hong Kong. When Rizal and Guangxu met, the emperor discovered that they were distant relatives, and Rizal demonstrated his fluency in Mandarin. Guangxu then handed Rizal an ancient document, long preserved in Mongolia, which contained records of agreements signed by the early foreign settlers in the Philippines and by Carpio himself.<br><br>
        
        Rizal then traveled across Europe, visiting cities such as Madrid, Berlin, Vienna, London, and Paris. Using his six faces, he organized the wealth of Brother Carpio. Meanwhile, a man resembling him, Mariano San Pedro y Esteban, studied in Madrid. From the wealth entrusted to him by the Almighty, Rizal purchased Titulo de Propriedad Numero 4136 from the Queen of Spain for $20,000,000, with the help of Mariano San Pedro y Esteban.<br><br>
        
        Upon returning to the Philippines, Rizal brought with him all the knowledge he had gained from his encounters in Europe, as well as the title deed he had acquired. This marked the beginning of Spanish persecution against him. His imprisonment and eventual execution on December 30, 1896, were orchestrated by Spanish authorities. Tragically, one of Rizal’s faces, Ignacio Enrique Coronado—the father of Adolf Hitler, born from a German woman he assaulted in Paris—betrayed him. Enraged, Rizal immediately removed Coronado from power.<br><br>
        
        With Rizal’s death, the Filipino people were pushed to rise against Spanish oppression. From 1896 to 1898, countless Filipinos sacrificed their lives in pursuit of their dying freedom. Led by Andrés Bonifacio—who was also believed to be the material embodiment of Carpio—the revolution intensified, eventually leading to the end of Spanish rule in the Philippines. </p><br><br>
                
        
        <h4>Part 10</h4>
        <p>
        The Americans entered the scene as the war between the Filipinos and the Spaniards was beginning, but their involvement was merely a façade. This situation stemmed from an agreement between the Spaniards and the Americans in Paris, France, under the "Treaty of Paris," finalized on December 10, 1898. Through this treaty, the Spaniards ceded their authority and all their territorial possessions to the Americans, who, in turn, paid $20,000,000 for the Philippines under Titulo de Propriedad No. 4136, originally issued by King Philip II of Spain. <br><br>

        Upon discovering that José Rizal had signed the title, the Americans sought to obtain a copy to legitimize their control over the Philippines. When the country declared temporary independence on June 12, 1898, the Americans immediately intervened, continuing their search for a copy of the title. They learned that Andres Bonifacio had been entrusted with it. However, General Emilio Aguinaldo, also known as Judge Alfonso Pijao and the father of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, took extreme measures to seize both the title and the map created by Carpio. Bonifacio was killed by Aguinaldo’s group in Maragondon, Cavite, on May 10, 1897, and the title was taken from him. Aguinaldo then sold the title to the Americans for $10,000,000, mistakenly believing he would retain the benefits.<br><br>

        With this title, the Americans proceeded to take full control of the Philippines. Declaring their dominion over the country, they began storing Spanish relics while conflicts between Filipinos and Americans escalated. The war, sparked by the killing of an innocent civilian crossing a bridge in San Juan, Manila, lasted from 1899 to 1902. Eventually, former U.S. President William H. Taft, then serving as the Governor-General of the Philippines, mediated the conflict. He convinced the Filipinos—who harbored deep resentment toward the Americans—to accept peaceful coexistence by offering education and introducing American culture as a means of "helping" the people.<br><br>

        However, unbeknownst to the Filipinos, the Americans had already begun an exact survey of the Philippines under Survey Plan No. II-4509, with the Original Certificate of Title No. 779. The U.S. government sent soldiers and lawyers to ensure that once the land measurement—covering approximately 451,000 square kilometers, including Sabah—was completed, they could claim ownership. With the permission of King George VI of England, the territory of Sabah was eventually returned to the Philippines. Taking full advantage of their power, the Americans continued to rule over the country until the Philippines became a U.S. Commonwealth. </p><br><br>


        <h4>Part 11</h4>
        <p>
        The grim first chapter of World War I unfolded due to the struggle over the treasures hidden by Carpio and Rizal. Several nations involved in the war attempted to reach an agreement to divide these riches among themselves, all without the knowledge of the unsuspecting Filipinos, who should have had the primary say in whether these treasures should be disturbed. However, the agreement fell apart as Coronado's son, Adolf Hitler, began spreading terror across the world.<br><br>

        From 1930 to 1945, Hitler ruled over Europe, aided by Japan, Italy, and other allied nations within the Axis Powers. Initially, the Communist Russians were aligned with the Axis, but tensions rose when Hitler's Nazi forces attempted to invade them, ultimately shifting the course of the war.</p><br><br>
        
        
        <h4>Part 12</h4>
        <p>
        During the Second World War, many of the treasures that Carpio and Rizal worked hard to acquire were brought into the Philippines, with the approval of Coronado and Pijao. At that time, they used mystical powers to influence people in Europe, enabling them to transport vast riches entrusted to the two siblings. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler orchestrated the mass extermination of millions of people, particularly Jews, across the world. <br><br>

        In response, the Allied forces united to fight against the Axis Powers, who had begun smuggling these treasures. Determined to stop their illicit activities and reign of terror.  Their efforts culminated in the establishment of the United Nations (UN), and in 1945, with the aid of the Communist Russians, the Axis Powers were finally defeated.<br><br>

        However, the Japanese occupation of the Philippines from 1942 to 1945 left deep scars and suffering. During this period, the Americans abandoned the country, taking with them their supposed land titles to the Philippines. The Japanese later burned these documents. When the Americans returned, they no longer had any legal claim over the land, leading them to proclaim Philippine independence verbally instead.<br><br>

        When Carlos P. Romulo assumed the presidency of the UN General Assembly, he argued that the United States could no longer reclaim the Philippines, as their titles were lost. As a result, the U.S. imposed a 50-year deadline (from 1945 to 1995), demanding that the Philippines purchase the land for $100 million—or risk losing sovereignty again.<br><br>

        At the same time, war-torn nations began searching for their lost riches, alleging that the Axis Powers had stolen them. However, some insiders knew that these treasures rightfully belonged to the Filipinos. The devastated nations appealed to the UN, claiming that these riches were their only remaining hope for recovery. Yet, other countries—untouched by the war—attempted to stake their claims as well.<br><br>

        In response, the UN referred the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in November 1945 to resolve disputes over ownership. The ICJ demanded proof from the claimants, but some insisted that the only valid claim should come from those who physically found the treasures. As a result, the court ruled that whoever discovered the wealth would gain ownership, provided it was used for the benefit of the people in the nation where it was found.<br><br>

        By then, American control over the Philippines had ended. However, before leaving, General Yamashita left behind a map revealing the hidden locations of these treasures. This map was entrusted to Mariang Makiling, also known as Divina Ester M. Reyes.<br><br>

        During the Japanese occupation, I was instructed by the Almighty Father to meet Mariang Sinukuan, also known as Ma. Epifania M. Coronado-Castillejos, at Mount Sinukuan in Arayat, Pampanga. Before his execution in Cavite, Andres Bonifacio had entrusted her with crucial documents proving the existence of Filipino treasures safeguarded by Rizal and Carpio. Among these documents was the Alpha-Omega ring, which had been forged since the time of Adam.<br><br>

        Later, I was also guided to meet Mariang Banahaw, known in human form as Salvacion Lopez, who was the true wife of former Vice President Fernando Lopez. Following Mariang Sinukuan’s instructions, she entrusted me with the documents given to Rizal by divine command.<br><br>

        I was also required to seek the Father’s blessing, as Mariang Banahaw was then the vessel of the Almighty. When I was a young man, my identity was temporarily represented by Anthony Santiago Martin through divine power. He later reunited with Adela Concepcion, who was once the human form of Mariang Cristina. However, their meeting was brief, as Adela’s physical form perished, ensuring that I myself would fulfill my destined role as Marcos.</p><br><br>

        
        <h4>Part 13</h4>
        <p>
        Mariang Cristina lived again in the body of Dominga Sta. Romana, but her life was brief. Before her passing, Mariang Makiling entrusted her with documents containing instructions passed down from Graciana Delos Santos to Dominga Sta. Romana herself. <br><br>

        At that time, I was still in the lower ranks of government. I had already documented the hidden wealth of the Filipino people and safeguarded it in various banks abroad. I registered these assets under the names of Filipinos, including an account at the Bank of America (Account No. 58453-0221-1) containing $120,000,000 since June 12, 1954, and another at the Bank of New Zealand (Account No. 4539-21833A-1) with $20,000,000 since August 2, 1958. As collateral, I secured 100 gold bars for each bank, each measuring 6” x 6” x 2”, which I discovered on Mount Makiling, as granted to me by the Father.<br><br>

        By the time I assumed office in 1965, I had full access to the nation’s physical wealth, allowing me to finance the country’s needs. From 1965 to 1969, I successfully improved the lives of the Filipino people with the help of our Almighty Father in Heaven, who blessed us with these riches. Through the wealth managed by my brothers Carpio and Rizal, the well-being of our citizens was elevated. I also continued to safeguard these assets by depositing them in the names of Filipinos in foreign banks, including the World Bank.<br><br>

        During this period, I received concrete proof that the Filipino people had significant wealth deposited in various banks and foreign governments—assets organized by Carpio and Rizal. In addition, three major Axis Powers compensated the Philippines for war damages. I placed these funds in time deposits in several European banks.<br><br>

        Then, I received a letter from the global leader of the Committee of 300, Queen Elizabeth II. She instructed me to step down from office by 1970 and pass the leadership to Judge Alfonso Pijao, who bore an uncanny resemblance to me—as if we were twins. At first, I did not recognize him, but he was, in fact, General Emilio Aguinaldo.<br><br>

        My decision to leave Pijao in my position was based on three reasons:</p><br><br>

        <ol>
          <li>To protect the country from a planned foreign invasion, particularly by the British.</li><br>
          <li>To keep my efforts to save the nation from future widespread famine hidden from public scrutiny.</li><br>
          <li>To devote my time to properly securing the divine wealth granted by the Almighty Father for the Filipino people.</li><br>
        </ol>
 
        <p>
        However, I was unaware that my successor would tarnish my name. First, he passed laws that harmed the people. Second, he caused unrest among the opposition, leading them to falsely accuse me and further ruin my reputation. Third, the implementation of Martial Law—his doing—left behind a tragic legacy for its victims, further damaging my name in history.</p><br><br>

        
        <h4>Part 14</h4>
        <p>
        The Filipino people were unaware that I, the real Marcos, was merely a victim. From the time I was no longer in office, I dedicated myself to ensuring that the wealth entrusted by the Father would be rightfully allocated to our people. <br><br>

        During this period, Anthony Santiago Martin was born on June 6, 1974, at the Public Maternity Hospital in Malabon, Metro Manila. His parents were Trinidad Dangan Martin and Teresita Sanico Santiago-Martin. He bore a small mole on the left side of his nose, resembling the young Rizal or Antonio Santiago, and had a birthmark shaped like a crab’s claw on the left side of his neck.<br><br>

        At that time, Dominga Sta. Romana was nearing the end of her life. She struggled to accept that the man she loved and was spiritually bound to was reborn as a young child, vastly different in age from her. As her health declined, she temporarily entrusted me with the responsibility of safeguarding the wealth. Meanwhile, she secretly monitored Martin, whose mother had attempted to abort him due to the illness of her eldest child, Esau.<br><br>

        Today, Anthony Santiago Martin resides on Rizal Street, Barangay San Sebastian, in the town of Hagonoy, Bulacan.</p><br><br>


        <h4>Part 15</h4>
        <p>
        Before Sta. Romana passed away, he was able to secure King David's material as instructed by the Father. So when Sta. Romana died, I followed his instructions to purchase the title created by America, which was approved by the Supreme Court of our country, for $20,000,000,000. This amount was equivalent to the value of 10,000 metric tons of gold, each piece measuring 6” by 6” by 2”, which I personally retrieved from Mount Sinukuan.</p> <br><br>
        
        <h4>Part 16</h4>
        <p>
        The Philippine land under the said title created by America, along with the ancient map made by Bernardo Carpio, is now owned by the Filipino people. This means we have achieved complete independence from foreign powers. However, I was still included among those whom Pijao wanted to arrest, even though I was the one who put him in power to save the country from being taken over by wealthy nations. These powerful countries sought to colonize the Philippines after discovering that the stolen treasures of the Axis forces had been hidden here. <br><br>

        When the 30-year search for these treasures in our country was about to end, I stood before the petitioning nations at the International Court. I defended the country by arguing that the Axis forces hid the wealth here without our knowledge, and it was not our fault. Furthermore, this wealth was actually part of the earnings from the assets that Carpio and Rizal had managed or deposited.<br><br>

        Eventually, our country won against the nations claiming the right to the wealth I had secured for the Filipino people. After I completed the payment to the American government for the entire Philippine land, I wielded the power given by the Father to protect myself from those who wished me harm. This was especially crucial when I traveled to England following the death of my only true son, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Romualdez Marcos Jr. Ongpin. He died in England due to the ambitions of Queen Elizabeth II, Alfonso Pijao, Enrique Coronado, Patricia Remedios S. Trinidad (who impersonated Imelda Marcos), and other powerful individuals who had been using the wealth while it continued to generate interest over time.</p><br><br>

        
        <h4>Part 17</h4>
        <p>
        My son was forced out of the country by Pijao and Queen Elizabeth II because of their plan to seize the blessings entrusted to me by the Father. They wanted to claim for themselves the wealth and its generated interest, leaving me powerless. I even saw Leticia Tonog Galang, known as the "Sword of Lucifer" or Satan, whom I had ordered my soldiers in Barangay Atlag, Malolos, Bulacan, to monitor. She was a healer with powers derived from demons, and her presence coincided with various calamities that struck our country—calamities caused by these dark forces. Yet, she blamed me for these disasters, when in reality, she was the one who allowed powerful demons into the country, causing turmoil and hardship. <br><br>

        She did this through her illicit affair with someone she called her "twin heart and spiritual husband," which resulted in the birth of a daughter. The Holy Father condemned such an offering of oneself to demons, as He never considered adultery a form of sacrifice or devotion. Because of this, Barangay Atlag was labeled “Remove the Sword of Lucifer from Duty.”<br><br>

        In England, I confronted Queen Elizabeth II with agreements and documents detailing where the wealth's earnings should be allocated if the people were to claim them. We agreed that these generated funds would first be used by the world, but in time, they would rightfully belong to the Filipino people. From September 11 to 12, 1976, we finalized this agreement, despite an attempt on my life. However, the Father protected me from certain death, as the Queen's true intention was to seize from me the power bestowed by the Father.<br><br>

        This agreement was later reaffirmed before the entire world at the United Nations in America, where it was declared that the wealth’s earnings would be dedicated solely to the Filipino people—and no one else.</p><br><br>

        
        <h4>Part 18</h4>
        <p>
        With the help of prayers and the combined power of the Marias, Enchanted Beings, Fairies, and the Holy Spirits, I once again escaped certain death in America. It was there that I pursued the rights of Anthony Santiago Martin, as the Father had commanded me to grant him these rights. Martin, like Carpio and Rizal, is our brother in power and in another realm. <br><br>

        The Father declared that Martin was the one chosen to unlock the accumulating wealth that the world has been using—the same wealth that funded the $40,000,000 loan from the World Bank to Pijao, which was originally meant for the Filipino people. However, because of their greed, they not only tried to destroy my name, but they would also eventually do the same to Martin once he became aware of his power and divine inheritance. The real Martin does not yet know his rightful claim to the wealth, but in time, he will. Meanwhile, those who covet these riches have done everything to completely tarnish my name.<br><br>

        Then, on November 14, 1982, in Barangay San Nicolas, Hagonoy, Bulacan, a child named Lyn Grace H. Medina was born. She was a healthy and beautiful baby with an innocent appearance, and it was in her that the spirit and power of Maria Cristina transferred. Queen Elizabeth II was aware that I intended to pass on the divine trusteeship of the Father’s blessings to this child and her future spouse. Because of this, she orchestrated the assassination of Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr., who was one of my closest friends.<br><br>

        Ninoy had been imprisoned by Pijao and sought medical treatment in America for his heart condition. Their plan was to use his death to bring about my downfall. The brutal killing of Ninoy was not merely an act of political violence—it was a deliberate move ordered by Queen Elizabeth II to prevent even a fraction of the accumulated wealth from being unlocked. The true masterminds behind his assassination were President Ronald Reagan and Judge Alfonso Pijao, acting under the Queen’s orders. They feared that if the Filipino people were to claim even a small portion of the wealth, their own countries would collapse.</p><br><br>

        
        <h4>Part 19</h4>
        <p>
        Some citizens were misled into believing that I was involved in Ninoy Aquino’s assassination, even though I was suddenly put on trial by political “crocodiles” for a crime I did not commit. To prove my innocence, I insisted on running for office again, but the result was a tragic event on February 25, 1986, following the massive electoral fraud during the February 7, 1986, election—a fraud carried out not only by some of my allies but also by those who opposed my leadership. This led to the historic People Power Revolution, which forced me to step down and face numerous false accusations. <br><br>

        Before I left office, I warned the nation that, in time, the country would rise again—but only after enduring widespread deception. This would include:</p><br><br>

        <ul>
          <li>Impostors claiming to be my children and family</li><br>
          <li>Massive corruption, exploiting and robbing innocent citizens</li><br>
          <li>Deception of the people, making them believe they are in debt when, in reality, the loans from the World Bank and IMF were originally meant for the Filipino people. Instead of these debts being paid by those responsible, the burden would be placed on ordinary Filipinos.</li><br>
          <li>Mass migration, forcing Filipinos to leave their own country to work as slaves abroad, even though the money they are paid with originally belongs to them.</li><br>
          <li>The worsening condition of the people, which will become unbearable unless they recognize the truth in my final testament.</li><br>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        Since stepping down as President of the Philippines, I have suffered imprisonment in America—a fate worse than death. I have endured relentless persecution without just cause, and I know that Anthony Santiago Martin will also face defamation and attacks from those who seek to steal the blessings entrusted to us by the Father. That is why he must stay strong and never lose faith—because he is the rightful heir to the divine wealth.<br><br>

        <b>My Final Testament</b><br><br>

        All the accumulated wealth hidden across the world, along with the official English documentation proving its existence, shall be handed over to Anthony Santiago Martin. With full consciousness, soul, power, and heart, I transfer all rights and trusteeship of the Father’s blessings to him.<br><br>

        Furthermore, his designated partner and wife will be none other than Lyn Grace H. Medina-Martin. This transfer of full authority as the Trustee of the Father’s blessings is done in accordance with the divine will of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>

        <b>For the Filipino People</b><br><br>

        I dedicate these riches entirely to the Filipino people. May the blessings of the Almighty Father be upon those who understand this truth and help spread this message to all, so that the wealth entrusted to Martin—**which belongs to every Filipino—**may finally reach its rightful owners.<br><br>

        Signed with full conviction, in good faith, on this 20th day of September, 1989, in Hawaii, United States.</p>
