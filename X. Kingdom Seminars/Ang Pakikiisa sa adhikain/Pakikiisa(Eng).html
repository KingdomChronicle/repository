            <b>Who wishes to join this cause? </b><br>

            <b>Part 2:</b><br><br>
            
            <b>The True Spirit of Sacrifice: The Blood and Sweat of Quiet Heroes</b> <br><br>

            This cause was not born out of luxury, influence, or power—but from the suffering and hopes of ordinary people. It is not a project of the wealthy or those in power. It is the product of the dreams of the oppressed, forgotten by those in power, yet upheld by the small voices who still believe in hope for the nation.<br><br>

            It was born from the desires of people without high status in society, whose voices are unheard, yet who continue to have faith that the Philippines still has hope. Despite their lack—indeed, many who started this were poor in their own lives—what they had in abundance was love for the country. They gave—not leftovers, but their whole selves—to advance the promise of the Filipino nation.<br><br>

            The food we receive at gatherings, the travel, the equipment we use—all these do not come from excess. They come from sacrifice. They come from people who, even when sometimes there was no food in their own homes, chose to give for the country. Not because they could, but because they chose to believe.<br><br>

            They chose to set themselves aside for the sake of the nation. And this is the true meaning of love—the self-sacrifice for the welfare of the many.<br><br>

            This program was not initiated by those in power, but by those at the margins—by the poor, the lacking, those who were never given the chance but stood firm to become the channels of new hope.<br><br>

            In every bite of bread we eat during our proclamations, every drop of gasoline, every microphone cable—there is an equivalent of tears, prayers, and the surrender of personal comfort. Because for them, true comfort is seeing the nation rise again.<br><br>

            <b>Why do they do this?</b><br><br>

            Because they themselves—those who struggle in life—understand the value of helping the most. They are the ones who know how hard it is to live as if no one hears you, so now God has used them so that we may hear.<br><br>

            And in every proclamation, every journey, every simple meal or message passed along—there is the sacrifice of people we may never meet or even know—but they are the true heroes of our time.<br><br>

            We believe that in every proclamation rests a hero sleeping in the heart of every listener. And when truth strikes their spirit, they will rise, join, and help carry this cause.<br><br>

            The movement for the Philippines' resurgence rests on sacrifice—and sacrifice is the true foundation of success.<br><br>

            So if you are among those who have heard this call—do not waste it. Instead of asking what you will gain from this movement, ask yourself:<br><br>

            <i>"What can I offer and what help can I give?"</i><br><br>

            Because with every sacrifice and offering, a nation will rise again.<br><br>


            <b>How Will We Reach and Prepare Our Countrymen?</b><br><br></p>

            <ol>
              <li>
            <b>We Will Reach Them Through Proclamations Like This</b><br><br>

            We cannot touch the heart of every Filipino if we remain silent. Proclamation is our first step—a passionate and open declaration of long-hidden truths, and of hope that must be rekindled in the nation’s heart.<br><br>

            Each proclamation is like a trumpet calling to the sleeping spirits. It is an invitation to the heroes of this generation to awaken and join the great purpose that God has for the country.<br><br>

            This is not merely an event or a gathering. It is the initial call, a spiritual and patriotic declaration saying:   <br><br>
            
            <i>“Arise, Philippines. The time to answer the call has come.”</i><br><br>
              </li>

              <li>
            <b>We Will Prepare Them Through the Program</b><br><br>

            Hearing the good news alone is not enough. It must be understood, studied, and lived. This is where our program comes in—a systematic process of education, awakening, and restoring the true Filipino identity as a chosen nation.<br><br>

            This program is not just a lecture series—it is a spiritual discipline and a national action. It shapes the hearts, minds, and commitments of each person to be worthy heirs of the promised land entrusted to us by God.<br><br>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
            <b>Like the Israelites: They Fight for the Promise</b><br><br>

            In the Old Testament, God promised the Israelites the land of Canaan—a rich, abundant, and blessed land. But the promise was not given automatically. They had to fight for it—step by step, tearing down walls, and following every directive from God.<br><br>

            <b>We are in the same position today.</b><br><br>

            The promised future of the Philippines—a nation that will be a light to other countries—is not simply handed to us. We are called to fight for it through sacrifice, teaching, action, and carrying the burden together.<br><br>

            <b>The Promised Land in the End of Days: A Mystery of the Future</b><br><br>

            No other nation in the world has been given such a promise:<br><br>

            <ul>
              <li>
            <b><i>Its light will reach every corner of the world.</i></b><br><br>

            “Its honor will be restored beyond the expectations of its people, for this is the greatest rising a nation can achieve—even when compared to the renown of earlier powerful nations across various civilizations in history.”<br><br>
              </li>

              <li>
            <b><i>Its land will be loved and envied by diverse peoples—who will wish they were born there.</i></b><br><br>

            This is not a fantasy. It is part of God’s great plan—and as someone who has learned this, you are part of its fulfillment.<br><br>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            <b>Tears Are Not Enough—We Must Act</b><br><br>

            It is not enough to just cry upon hearing these truths. This is not a story to weep over then return to old habits.<br><br>

            Our knowledge is a call to action. <br><br> 
            
            Our emotions are reminders of the mission we must fulfill.
            <br><br>
            Discovering this promise is the start of our responsibility.<br><br>

            <b>The Call of Our Time: Act and Participate</b><br><br>

            We are the ones who know. We are the first to be called. And in the face of the light we have seen, there is no room left to be mere spectators.<br><br></p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                We are called to act, to participate, and to sacrifice.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will be God’s hands to reach others.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will be the voice of truth in the midst of silence.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will be the new generation of heroes, not armed with weapons, but with faith, knowledge, and love for the nation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
            <b>How can we participate and join the cause?</b><br><br>

            We will join in spreading the program—a program aiming not just to teach, but to revive a spirit that is patriotic, God-fearing, and service-oriented.<br><br>

            This is the path for truth and hope to reach every corner of the Philippines—from remote villages to city centers, and into the hearts of Filipinos abroad.<br><br>

            Our participation is not just physical presence, but a responsibility to this cause.<br><br>

            Every invitation and every act of help—is part of a single movement striving to lift the nation spiritually, morally, and nationally.<br><br>

            <b>What Do We Need to Do?</b><br><br>

            The next steps are simple, but they form the foundation of greater responsibilities. True national uplift begins with those ready to start small—people who don’t wait for positions or recognition, but act willingly because they know it is right.<br><br>
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Start with Basic Help</b><br><br>

              Your first step is sincere help—even if it seems small to others.<br><br>

              This may be: <br><br>

              <ul>
                <li>Inviting acquaintances to attend proclamations.</li>
                <li>Assisting with event needs, such as food, supplies, or transportation.</li>
                <li>Praying for every activity and success of the cause.</li>
              </ul> <br>
                        
              <p>Help is never too small if it comes from a heart ready to sacrifice.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Preparing for Greater Responsibility</b><br><br>

              If you prove faithful, diligent, and serious about this mission, God—and the program—will entrust you with wider responsibilities.<br><br>

              True leadership is not sought; it is given to those who demonstrate themselves in secret, silent, and honest service.<br><br>

              As said in a film:  <br><br>

              <b><i>“With great power comes great responsibility.”</i></b><br><br>

              Yes, the message in the film is right—but in our context, this means more. Every talent, intelligence, and opportunity you have is no accident. It is given by God so that you become a channel of help, guidance, and hope for many.<br><br>

              So if you know more, have more resources, or greater ability—do not be proud, but humble yourself and serve.<br><br>

              Because the wealth of knowledge and ability has a purpose—and that is not for self-benefit, but for the good of the nation.

            </li>
          </ol> <br>

            <h3><b>Call to Action:</b></h3> 
            <p>Everyone Who Accepts This Cause Has a Role to Play</p>

            <ol>
              <li><b>Develop Your Knowledge and Heart for the Nation</b> <br><br>

            Use your personal page for your daily word,
            participate in the program’s activities such as proclamations, submitting your reflections and devotions, and joining our online discussions ("kapehan").<br><br>

            These are not ordinary activities, whether in person or online—they are powerful tools to teach, mobilize, and awaken consciousness.<br><br>

            The lessons and messages from the program will give you the right direction and the right heart—a heart free from self-interest, filled instead with pure love for the country.<br><br>

            Strive also to develop the knowledge God has given you. Your knowledge, talents, and experiences were not given to be hidden—they were entrusted to you to be an instrument in the nation’s renewal.
            </li><br>

            <li><b>Responsibilities Only You Can Fulfill:</b><br><br>

            Each of us has a unique reach—people you know whom others might not reach.<br>
            You are the bridge.<br>
            You are the pathway for this truth and cause to reach them.<br><br>

            <i>"Your inaction could become someone else's despair."</i><br><br>

            So as you learn, it is also your duty to invite, pray for, and make others feel our purpose.
              </li><br>

              <li><b>Support the Proclamations: Across the Nation</b> <br><br>

            We need many proclamations—from cities to barangays, in every corner of the country and even in OFW communities abroad.<br><br>

           <i>"If we do not proclaim our cause, how will the nation hear it?"</i><br><br>

            And as you are shaped by the program, there will come a time when you yourself will lead these proclamations.<br><br>

            You will not only support them—you will be the voice of the call.
              </li><br>

              <li><b>Share in the Sacrifice: Logistics, Supplies, and Food</b><br><br>

              Every proclamation and event has logistics and expenses—and if only a few carry this burden, it will be hard to reach the majority or the entire nation.<br><br>

              This cause involves sacrifice—so we call on everyone to carry their share.<br><br>

              Here are concrete ways to help:<br><br>

              Sponsor food, fuel, or transportation costs. <br><br>

              Loan or donate equipment like speakers, microphones, or projectors for proclamation leaders to use.<br><br>

              Even if your contribution is small, cover the food allowance for one or more attendees.<br><br>

              Nothing is small in God’s eyes if it comes from a sincere heart.
              </li><br>

              <li><b>Educate Yourself: Never Be Thirsty for the Truth You Must Know, Especially as a Filipino—Who Am I and What Does My Country Truly Have?</b> <br><br>

            Most importantly:   <br>
            Strive to improve your knowledge and understanding of our cause as an individual and as a nation. <br><br>

            Join in:<br><br>

            <ol>
              <li><b>Patriotic and God-centered reflections:</b> <br>
            Read the daily materials provided.</li><br>

            <li><b>Discussions:</b><br> Participate in online gatherings: <br>
            where you can learn about the hearts of your countrymen and share your own hopes for the nation's renewal. Share what you have learned from the readings given to us. </li><br>

            <li><b>Program activities:</b> <br>
            Participating in proclamations and shouldering the cause will give you joy because our cause has a purpose. Every Filipino touched and changed by the program is our shared victory in advancing this cause.<br><br>

            Because a nation that is not awake can be easily deceived.<br>
            And a leader without knowledge is a danger.<br><br>

            <i>"Freedom is born of light; light is born of knowledge."</i><br><br>

            If we want to be worthy of the promise God has destined for the Philippines, we must prepare our minds, hearts, and lives.<br><br>

            <b>Final Reminder:</b> <br>
            The Hope of Others Depends on You<br><br>

            The call is clear.<br>
            The direction has been given.<br>
            The opportunity is before you.</li>
            </ol> <br><br>

              </li><br>
            </ol>

            <p>
            <b>The question is:</b> <br><br>
            Will you answer the call?<br><br>

            You do not have to be great to start.<br>
            You only need to be honest, willing to learn, and open-hearted to serve.</p>
