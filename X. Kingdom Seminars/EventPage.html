            <center><h2 style="color: blue;">PROGRAM INFORMATION</h2></center>
            <br><br>

            
            <p>
              "The time promised by God has come at last! The Kingdom of God is near! Repent of your sins and believe the Good News!" <br><br>
              
              These words, spoken by Jesus, proclaim the arrival of God’s Kingdom and the fulfillment of His divine promises. This pivotal moment in history marks the beginning of a transformative era, where the message of repentance and belief in the Good News becomes the pathway to restoration and hope.<br><br>
              
              The essence of the Good News lies in the unveiling of God’s grand plan to restore His creation. From the very beginning, God envisioned a perfect world—a harmonious existence where His will reigned supreme. However, the fall of humanity through Adam and Eve’s disobedience introduced sin, suffering, and death into the world. This brokenness extends not only to personal struggles but also to the collective challenges of society, such as corruption, injustice, and moral decay. These consequences serve as reminders of humanity's separation from God, as outlined in Romans 3:23: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."<br><br>
              
              Amidst this brokenness, the Good News shines as a beacon of hope. Jesus Christ, the appointed King of God’s Kingdom, came to bridge the gap between humanity and God. His message, "The Kingdom of God is near," calls for repentance—a turning away from sin and a commitment to align one’s life with God’s will. It also calls for faith, a belief in Christ’s sacrifice as the means of redemption from sin’s curse (Romans 5:12). Through repentance and faith, individuals gain access to the promise of restoration and eternal life in God’s Kingdom.<br><br>
              
              The Kingdom of God, however, offers more than individual salvation. It is a promise of universal renewal, a time when all of creation will be restored to its original perfection. Acts 3:19-21 reminds us of this hope: "Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, and that He may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus. Heaven must receive Him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as He promised long ago through His holy prophets." This vision of a restored world, free from sin and filled with righteousness, peace, and joy, fuels the faith of believers and inspires them to persevere through life’s trials.<br><br>
              
              Living as citizens of God’s Kingdom means more than embracing its promises—it means reflecting its values in daily life. Believers are called to embody love, pursue justice, and work toward the advancement of God’s reign on earth. This involves actively participating in God’s redemptive work, spreading His light and hope to a world desperate for help, healing and restoration.<br><br>
              
              A call to action. The time of waiting is over; the Kingdom of God is at hand. Jesus’ proclamation invites everyone to respond with urgency. It is a call to repent, believe, and live in the transformative power of the Good News. For those who accept this invitation, there is not only personal renewal but also the privilege of contributing to the realization of God’s Kingdom here on earth.<br><br>
              
              As we reflect on this powerful message, may we be inspired to proclaim the nearness of God’s Kingdom boldly. Let us embrace its hope, align our lives with God’s will, and share its transformative message with others. The time promised by God has indeed come at last, and the Kingdom of God is near.<br><br>
              
              We warmly invite you to join us for the upcoming Kingdom Proclamation.
