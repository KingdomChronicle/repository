        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”

      <h2>Series Title: <br> From Slave of Sin to Ambassadors of Christ</h2>
      <br />

      <h3>Lesson 5: The Honor of Being God’s Co-Worker</h3><br>

      <p>
        <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>

        From slavery to sin, God has called us not only to be saved but also to take part in His divine work here on earth. He has entrusted us with the mission of spreading the Good News and building His Kingdom. Thus, we are not merely followers, but partners with Him in bringing salvation to many. To be a co-worker with God is a great privilege and a sign of the Father’s trust in His children.
      </p>

      <p><b>Teaching Points</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>The Meaning of “God’s Co-Worker”</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>The Apostle Paul said: <br>
            <i>“I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.” (1 Corinthians 3:6–9)
            </i></li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Characteristics of a Co-Worker of God</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Humble</b> – Recognizes that the results come from God, not from human effort.</li><br>
            <li><b>Faithful and Obedient</b> – Works not for self-glory, but for the glory of God.</li><br>
            <li><b>Diligent and Patient</b> – Does not give up in hardship, knowing that labor in the Lord is never in vain.</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Privileges of Being God’s Co-Worker</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Trusted by God – He entrusts us with a share in His plan of salvation.</li><br>
            <li>Partnership with God – Our labor is not done alone; it comes with His presence and strength.</li><br>
            <li>Sharing in the Reward – As Paul declared: <br><br>
            <i>“Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.” (1 Corinthians 15:58)
            </i></li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Responsibilities of God’s Co-Worker</b><br><br>
          
        <ul>
        <li>To faithfully plant and water, even when the results are not immediately visible.</li><br>
        <li>To work in unity with fellow laborers, for the mission is one.</li><br>
        <li>To remain faithful until the end, for every good work will be rewarded.</li><br>      
       </ul>
        </li><br>
      </ol>

       <p><b>Scriptural Basis</b></p>
       
       <ul>
        <li>1 Corinthians 15:58 - “Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.”</li><br>
        <li>John 15:16 - “You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last…”</li><br>
        <li>1 Corinthians 3:6–9 - <sup>6</sup> “I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. <sup>7</sup> So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. <sup>8</sup> The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. <sup>9</sup> For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.”</li><br>
       </ul>

        <p><b>Discussion Questions</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>What did Paul mean when he said, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth”?</li><br>
          <li>How can you show your faithfulness as a co-worker in your church or community?</li><br>
          <li>What is the privilege of working with God in His mission?</li><br>
          <li>Why is it important to remain diligent in the Lord’s work even during trials?</li><br>
        </ol>

          <p><b>Application / Challenge</b></p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Personal Reflection:</b>Identify the areas of your life where God is calling you to be more active as His co-worker. Are you planting, watering, or doing both?</li><br>
            <li><b>Faith Response:</b>Pray daily for a humble and faithful heart, one that relies not on your own strength but on God who brings growth.</li><br>
            <li><b>Action Step:</b>Take one concrete step this week as a co-worker of God—whether sharing the Good News, teaching or encouraging fellow believers, or faithfully serving in your church or community.</li><br>
          </ol>

          <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

          <p>Being a co-worker of God is a mark of the Father’s great trust. Each of us has a role—some plant, others water—but it is only God who brings the growth. Therefore, let us not grow weary in our labor; instead, let us continue with faithfulness, humility, and zeal, knowing that our work is never in vain in the Lord. <br><br>
            A true friend of God is not only a listener but also a bearer of fruit—faithful as a co-worker in His Kingdom.
            </p>
