        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Series Title: <br> From Slave of Sin to Ambassadors of Christ</h2>
      <br />

      <h3>Lesson 2: The Importance and Meaning of Being a Servant of God</h3><br>

      <p>
        <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>

        After Christ set us free from sin, He did not leave us without direction. He called us to become “servants of God.” Far from being a negative concept, this is an honor and a mark of true freedom. To be a servant of God means a complete surrender of our lives, walking in holiness, and living for Him.
      </p>

      <p><b>Teaching Points</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>From Slavery to Sin to Servanthood of God</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Once we were bound by sin, but now we are called to be servants of righteousness (Romans 6:17–18).</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>The Meaning of Being a Servant of God</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete surrender of self (Matthew 16:24).</li><br>
            <li>Recognizing that He is the true owner of our lives (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).</li><br>
            <li>Submitting to His righteousness and holiness.</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>The Privileges of Being God’s Servant</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Freedom from the chains of sin.</li><br>
            <li>Growth in holiness and transformation of character.</li><br>
            <li>The hope of eternal life (Romans 6:22).</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Examples of God’s Servants</b><br><br>
          
        <ul>
        <li><b>Mary:</b> “Behold, the servant of the Lord.” (Luke 1:38)</li><br>

        <li><b>James:</b> “James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.” (James 1:1)</li><br>
        <li><b>Peter:</b> “Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ.” (2 Peter 1:1)</li><br>
        <li><b>Jude:</b> “Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James.” (Jude 1:1)</li><br>
        <li><b>John:</b> “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him… and He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John.” (Revelation 1:1)</li><br>
        <li><b>Moses:</b> “So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab.” (Deuteronomy 34:5)</li><br>
        <li><b>Joshua:</b> “After the death of Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the Lord…” (Joshua 24:29)</li><br>
        <li><b>David:</b> Often referred to by God as “My servant David.” (2 Samuel 7:8; Psalm 89:20)</li><br>        
       </ul>
        </li><br>
      </ol>

       <p><b>Scriptural Basis</b></p>
       
       <ul>
        <li>Romans 6:22 – “But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.”</li><br>

          <li>What areas of your life are you still struggling to fully surrender to God?</li><br>

          <p><b>Application / Challenge</b></p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Personal Reflection:</b> Who are you truly following each day—yourself, sin, or God?</li><br>
            <li><b>Faith Response:</b> Bring to prayer the areas of your life not yet submitted to Him.</li><br>
            <li><b>Action Step:</b> Take one concrete step of obedience this week—such as forgiving, changing an attitude, or serving.</li><br>
          </ol>

          <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

          <p>Being a servant of God is not the loss of freedom but the only path to true freedom. It is a mark of humility and total surrender to Him. In our servanthood to God, we discover holiness, peace, and the assurance of eternal life. Let us boldly declare: “I am a servant of the Lord, and this is the highest honor.”</p>
