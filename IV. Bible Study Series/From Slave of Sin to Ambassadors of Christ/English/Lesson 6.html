        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Series Title: <br> From Slave of Sin to Ambassadors of Christ</h2>
      <br />

      <h3>Lesson 6: The Highest Trust – Becoming an Ambassador of God</h3><br>

      

      <p>
        <b>Series Recap</b> <br><br>

        In our journey from Lesson 1 to Lesson 5, we have seen the progressive growth of a person who belongs to the Kingdom of God. Each stage is both a privilege and an honor given by God, and with each privilege comes responsibility.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Lesson 1: Saved by God</b><br>From slavery to sin, we were redeemed and set free by the blood of Christ. The first step in our journey into the Kingdom is salvation.</li><br>
        <li><b>Lesson 2: Becoming a Servant of God</b><br>From freedom, we are called to become servants of righteousness—a mark of complete surrender to the will of God.</li><br>
        <li><b>Lesson  3: Becoming a Child of God</b><br>Faithful servants are lifted up and called children, made heirs of the Kingdom.</li><br>
        <li><b>Lesson 4: Becoming a Friend of God</b><br>Not all children become friends. Friends are those who draw near to God, converse with Him, and understand His will.</li><br>
        <li><b>Lesson 5: Becoming a Co-Worker of God</b><br>A true friend shares in God’s work. In the vineyard of the Lord, some plant, some water, but it is God who gives the growth. The reward is promised to every faithful worker.</li><br>
        
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now, in Lesson 6, we arrive at the highest level of trust—becoming an Ambassador of God. <br><br>
        This is the fullness of our calling: that in our lives we truly represent God and His Kingdom before all people.<br><br>
        This is not a role granted by men, but a divine appointment from God Himself.<br><br>
        And it is the greatest honor that our Father can entrust to us as His children.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>

        From slavery to sin, we were set free to become servants of God, called as children, counted as friends, and made co-workers in His vineyard. Yet the calling does not end there. The highest level of God’s trust is to become His ambassador on earth. <br><br>
        Being an ambassador of God is not attained through education, skill, or social position. It is a direct appointment from God Himself. It is a sign of His complete trust in a person whose whole life reflects the Kingdom of Heaven, so that through them the world may know who God truly is.

      </p>

      <p><b>Teaching Points</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>What is an Ambassador of God?</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>A representative of the Kingdom of God here on earth (2 Corinthians 5:20).</li><br>
            <li>A bearer of God’s message of reconciliation to humanity.</li><br>
            <li>A life that becomes a living image of the God he represents.</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Being an Ambassador: The Highest Trust</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Not every child of God automatically becomes an ambassador.</li><br>
            <li>This honor is the fruit of a life lived in humility, faithfulness, holiness, and steadfast service as a co-worker.</li><br>
            <li>Our representation is tested in every area of life: in words, actions, and character, people must see God in us.</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>The Responsibility of an Ambassador</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>To live with integrity and holiness, leaving no room for reproach against the God we represent.</li><br>
            <li>To carry the message of salvation and proclaim the Good News.</li><br>
            <li>To bring God’s will on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10).</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Contrast: The Failure of the World</b><br><br>
        <ul>
         <li>As the line in the Father’s Love Letter says: “I was being misrepresented by those people who don’t know me.”</li><br>      
         <li>Misrepresentation of God causes others to stumble.</li><br>      
         <li>That is why it is crucial for ambassadors to live rightly, so that the true nature of God—holy, loving, and faithful—may be revealed.</li><br>      
       </ul>
        </li><br>
      </ol>

       <p><b>Scriptural Basis</b></p>
       
       <ul>
        <li>2 Corinthians 5:20 - “We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making His appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.”</li><br>
        <li>Matthew 5:16 - “In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.”</li><br>
       </ul>

        <p><b>Discussion Questions</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>How is being an ambassador of God different from simply being His child or servant?</li><br>
          <li>How can we ensure that we do not misrepresent God in our daily lives?</li><br>
          <li>What is the greatest challenge for you as God’s representative in your family, workplace, or community?</li><br>
        </ol>

          <p><b>Application / Challenge</b></p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Personal Reflection:</b>In what areas are you being a faithful representative of God, and where do you need to change?</li><br>
            <li><b>Faith Response:</b>Begin living each day with the awareness that every word, action, and decision represents God.</li><br>
            <li><b>Action Step:</b>Set a goal this week to share a personal testimony with someone about God’s goodness.</li><br>
          </ol>

          <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

          <p>
          Becoming an ambassador of God is the highest level of trust that He can place upon a person. It is not a title given by men, but a divine appointment from Heaven. <br><br>

          In the life of an ambassador, nothing is seen but the God they represent—a God who is holy, loving, and righteous.<br><br>

          Let us, therefore, embrace this great calling. Let us not allow our weaknesses to misrepresent Him, but instead let our lives be mirrors of the Kingdom of Heaven here on earth, until the day of His return.
