        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Series Title: <br> From Slave of Sin to Ambassadors of Christ</h2>
      <br />

      <h3>Lesson 4: The Honor of Being a Friend of God</h3><br>

      <p>
        <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>

        Many know God as the Almighty, the Creator, and the King of all. Yet, a greater truth is this: God desires a personal relationship with us. From being servants and children, He invites us into a higher level of intimacy—to become His friends. Not every child experiences this depth of closeness or open communication. But God calls us to elevate our walk with Him, moving from being children to becoming true friends—a relationship marked by trust, obedience, and constant communication.
      </p>

      <p><b>Teaching Points</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Examples of God’s Friends</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Abraham</b> – Called God’s friend because of his faith and obedience (James 2:23).</li><br>
            <li><b>Moses</b> – Spoke with God face-to-face, as a friend speaks with a friend (Exodus 33:11).</li><br>
            <li><b>The Disciples of Jesus</b> – Raised from being servants to friends (John 15:15).</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Qualities of a Friend of God</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Trust and faith in Him.</li><br>

            <li>Obedience: “You are My friends if you do what I command you” (John 15:14).</li><br>
            <li>Entrusted with God’s secrets and plans.</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Privileges of a Friend of God</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Closeness – The privilege of approaching God without barriers.</li><br>
            <li>Favor and protection – As shown in the lives of Abraham and Moses.</li><br>
            <li>Partnership – Included in His mission and purpose.</li>
            <li>Unfailing love – A love the world cannot break.</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Responsibilities of a Friend of God</b><br><br>
          
        <ul>
        <li>Maintain faith and trust even in trials.</li><br>
        <li>Live in obedience and holiness.</li><br>
        <li>Bear witness to His love faithfully to others.</li><br>      
       </ul>
        </li><br>
      </ol>

       <p><b>Scriptural Basis</b></p>
       
       <ul>
        <li>John 15:14–15 – “You are My friends if you do what I command… I have called you friends.”</li><br>
        <li>James 2:23 – “And he was called a friend of God.”</li><br>
        <li>Exodus 33:11 – “The Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend.”</li><br>
        <li>1 John 3:1 – “See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God.”</li><br>
       </ul>

        <p><b>Discussion Questions</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>What is the difference between being a child of God and being a friend of God?</li><br>
          <li>How did Abraham, Moses, and the disciples become friends of God?</li><br>
          <li>What privileges do friends of God enjoy?</li><br>
          <li>How can you live out your friendship with God through constant communication?</li><br>
        </ol>

          <p><b>Application / Challenge</b></p>

          <ol>

            <li><b>Action Step:</b>Show faithful obedience to God’s commands as the mark of true friendship.</li><br>
          </ol>

          <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

          <p>Being called a friend of God is one of the greatest honors. We are not only His children but are also given the privilege of friendship—a relationship built on trust, obedience, and constant communication. Like Abraham, Moses, and the disciples, we too are invited to walk in intimacy with God. May we rise from being children to becoming His true friends, living out this friendship in our daily walk of obedience and communion with Him.</p>
