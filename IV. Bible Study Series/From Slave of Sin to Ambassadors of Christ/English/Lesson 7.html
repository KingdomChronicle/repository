        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Series Title: <br> From Slave of Sin to Ambassadors of Christ (Bonus and Culminating Lesson)</h2>
      <br />

      <h3>Lesson 7: A Royal Priesthood – God’s Holy Nation</h3><br>

      

      <p>
        <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>

        This entire series has taken us on a journey: from being slaves of sin to becoming children, friends, co-workers, and ambassadors of God. Yet all of these stages lead to one ultimate destination—our true identity as a royal priesthood. This is the fulfillment of God’s purpose: that His people would not only be saved, but also reign and serve alongside Him as His Kingdom here on earth.

      </p>

      <p><b>Teaching Points</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Chosen and Appointed by God</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>“But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.” — <b>1 Peter 2:9</b></li><br>
            <li>Our calling is not accidental; we were chosen even before the foundation of the world.</li><br>
            <li>To be a royal priesthood means we are both kings and priests—vested with authority and entrusted with holy service.</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Kings: Reigning with Christ</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>“You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.” — <b>Revelation 5:10</b></li><br>
            <li>As kings, Christ has given us authority over sin and the power of the enemy.</li><br>
            <li>We are called to govern—not by human strength, but by the righteousness of God’s Kingdom.</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Priests: Mediating and Serving</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>“You will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” — <b>Exodus 19:6</b></li><br>
            <li>The role of a priest is to stand between God and man—to offer, to pray, and to intercede.</li><br>
            <li>Under the New Covenant, we no longer offer the blood of animals, but present ourselves as living sacrifices.</li><br>
            <ul>
              <li><i><b>Romans 12:1 esv</b> - I appeal to you therefore, brothers,[a] by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.[b]</i></li><br>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>United in the Kingdom of God</b><br><br>
        <ul>
         <li>Each level we have studied (servant → child → friend → co-worker → ambassador) joins together to form the living picture of God’s Kingdom on earth.</li><br>      
         <li>Being a royal priesthood is not just an individual identity, but a collective calling as the people of God.</li><br>      
         <li>Through this, we see that God’s plan is not merely human salvation, but the establishment of His Kingdom on earth.</li><br>      
       </ul>
        </li><br>
      </ol>

       <p><b>Purpose: Declaring God’s Glory</b></p>
       
       <ul>
        <li>The royal priesthood’s mission is to proclaim the mighty works of God.</li><br>
        <li>The Kingdom becomes visible on earth when God’s people live in righteousness, holiness, and faithful witness to Christ.</li><br>
       </ul>

        <p><b>Discussion Questions</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>What does it mean to be part of a royal priesthood?</li><br>
          <li>How do kings and priests demonstrate their roles in the Kingdom of God today?</li><br>
          <li>Why is it important for all levels of spiritual growth (servant → child → friend → co-worker → ambassador) to culminate in a royal priesthood?</li><br>
          <li>How can your life actively declare God’s glory this week?</li><br>
        </ol>

          <p><b>Application / Challenge</b></p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Personal Reflection:</b>Embrace your true identity: you are not only saved, not only a child or friend—you are part of a royal priesthood.</li><br>
            <li><b>Faith Response:</b>Live with authority as a king and with the heart of service as a priest.</li><br>
            <li><b>Action Step:</b>Let your life demonstrate the Kingdom of God here on earth, until the return of Christ.</li><br>
          </ol>

          <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

          <p>
          Everything we have studied points to one great truth: <br><br>
          God’s plan is not merely individual salvation, but the raising of a holy people—a kingdom of kings and priests.<br><br>
          Together, as faithful servants, children, friends, co-workers, and ambassadors, we embody the Kingdom of God on earth.<br><br>
          “Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” — <b>Matthew 6:10</b>
