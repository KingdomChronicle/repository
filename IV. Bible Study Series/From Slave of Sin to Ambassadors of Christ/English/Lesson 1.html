        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Series Title: <br> From Slave of Sin to Ambassadors of Christ</h2>
      <br />

      <h3>Lesson 1: A Slave of Sin and the Salvation God Offers</h3><br>

      <p>
        <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>

        All people are born into sin. Because of Adam and Eve’s disobedience, the whole of humanity fell under the bondage of sin and death. No one can save themselves, no matter how hard they try. But the good news is this: God has provided salvation through Jesus Christ. He alone can set us free from sin and bring us true freedom.
      </p>

      <p><b>Teaching Points</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>The Bondage of Sin</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Humanity is enslaved by sin (<a href="#1">John 8:34</a>; <a href="#2">Romans 3:23</a>).</li><br>
            <li>The result: shameful deeds, slavery to evil desires, and death as its wage (Romans 6:21, 23a).</li><br>
            <li>This slavery to sin is not only seen in actions but is rooted in human nature and thought (Ephesians 2:1–3).</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>The Salvation God Offers</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Through Jesus Christ, the penalty of sin was paid by His death and resurrection (Romans 5:8).</li><br>
            <li>Salvation is a gift, not a result of human effort (Ephesians 2:8–9).</li><br>
            <li>The blood of Christ cleanses and redeems (Ephesians 1:7).</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Freedom Through Christ</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>If Christ sets you free, you are truly free (John 8:36).</li><br>
            <li>Those who receive Christ are given a new life and nature (2 Corinthians 5:17).</li><br>
            <li>This freedom is not just escape from sin but a life lived in righteousness and holiness (Romans 6:22).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

       <p><b>Scriptural Basis</b></p>
       
       <ul>
        <li>Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”</li><br>
        <li>Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</li><br>
        <li>John 8:34, 36 – “Everyone who sins is a slave to sin… So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”</li><br>
        <li>Ephesians 2:8–9 – “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.”</li><br>
       </ul>

        <p><b>Discussion Questions</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>What does it mean to be a slave of sin? How do we see this reality in society today?</li><br>
          <li>Why is human effort not enough to save us from sin?</li><br>
          <li>What is the most important thing Jesus did so we could receive salvation?</li><br>
          <li>In your personal experience, how have you seen the freedom that Christ brings?</li><br>
        </ol>

          <p><b>Application / Challenge</b></p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Personal Reflection:</b> Identify areas in your life where you still feel the chains of sin.</li><br>
            <li><b>Faith Response:</b> Remember that salvation is not by works but by faith in Christ.</li><br>
            <li><b>Action Step:</b> Live out your freedom by turning away from sin and choosing to obey God this week.</li><br>
          </ol>

          <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

          <p>Sin is a chain that leads to death, but God did not leave us in that condition. Through Jesus Christ, He offers salvation—a gift of grace that brings forgiveness, freedom, and eternal life. The first step toward becoming a child, a friend, and ultimately an ambassador of God is to receive Christ as Savior.</p>
