        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Series Title: <br> From Slave of Sin to Ambassadors of Christ</h2>
      <br />

      <h3>Lesson 3: God Counts His Servants as His Children</h3><br>

      <p>
        <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>

        In the earlier part of our study, we saw how we were set free from sin and given a new identity as servants of God. But God’s plan does not end there—beyond servanthood, the faithful servant is elevated and called a child of God. This is a tremendous privilege and a testimony of His great love: from being a servant to being part of His family and an heir of His Kingdom.
      </p>

      <p><b>Teaching Points</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>From Slave to Child</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>In the world, a slave has no rights or inheritance.</li><br>
            <li>But in the Kingdom of God, faithful servants are raised as children and heirs (Galatians 4:7).</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>Not All Are Children, Though All Are Created</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>All people are created by God (Genesis 1:27).</li><br>
            <li>Yet only those who receive Christ and live according to Him are called children (John 1:12).</li><br>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>The Privileges of Being Children of God</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>The Father’s Love: We are loved and called His children (1 John 3:1).</li><br>
            <li>Freedom from sin and fear (Romans 8:2, 15).</li><br>
            <li>The right to be heirs of the Kingdom and eternal life (Romans 8:17).</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>

        <li><b>The Transformation of Identity</b><br><br>
          
        <ul>
        <li>Once slaves to sin, now children of God.</li><br>
        <li>A child approaches not with fear, but with trust and love.</li><br>
        <li>As children, we are called to live in holiness and faithfulness.</li><br>      
       </ul>
        </li><br>
      </ol>

       <p><b>Scriptural Basis</b></p>
       
       <ul>
        <li>Galatians 4:7 – “So you are no longer a slave, but a child; and since you are His child, God has made you also an heir.”</li><br>
        <li>Romans 8:15–17 – We have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, “Abba, Father.”</li><br>
        <li>1 John 3:1 – “See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!”</li><br>
        <li>John 1:12 – “But to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God.”</li><br>
       </ul>

        <p><b>Discussion Questions</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>What is the difference between being God’s creation and being God’s child?</li><br>
          <li>How have you experienced God not only as Lord, but also as Father?</li><br>
          <li>What are the privileges and responsibilities of being God’s child?</li><br>
          <li>What does it mean to you that you are an heir of the Kingdom?</li><br>
        </ol>

          <p><b>Application / Challenge</b></p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Personal Reflection:</b>Embrace the truth that you are a child of God, not just His creation.</li><br>
            <li><b>Faith Response:</b>Approach God as a loving Father, not as a harsh master.</li><br>
            <li><b>Faith Response:</b>Live with trust, holiness, and love, as evidence that you belong to His family.</li><br>
            <li><b>Action Step:</b>Decide this week to show the character of a true child of God through forgiveness, love, and kindness.</li><br>
          </ol>

          <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

          <p>Being a child of God is the highest position a person can ever experience. From slavery, we are lifted up and made part of God’s family and heirs of His Kingdom. Not all who are created are children, but through receiving Christ, we gain a new identity. Let us live as true children of God—trusting, obeying, and loving—until the day we receive the glory that awaits us.</p>
