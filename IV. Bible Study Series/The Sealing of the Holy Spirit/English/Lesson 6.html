        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Who Will Be Sealed</h2>
      <br />

      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse(Foundation)</p>

      <h2>Revelation 14:12 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
        commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
      </p>

      <h2>John 10:16 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must
        bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and
        one shepherd.
      </p>

      <h2>Romans 2:14–15 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things
        contained in the law… their conscience also bearing witness, and their
        thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another.
      </p>

      <h2>Matthew 7:21 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
        kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
        heaven.
      </p>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Explanation / Expansion</h2>
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          The sealing of God’s people is not confined to one religious label,
          denomination, or group.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          God does not look at outward affiliation, but at the heart, obedience,
          and loyalty of every individual.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The seal of God rests only upon those who align their lives with His
          will, regardless of background or status.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Faithful believers who endure under trial and persecution will receive
          the seal.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Others who sincerely followed God with limited knowledge will embrace
          the full truth when it is revealed to them.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Even individuals outside organized religion—who live uprightly
          according to conscience and the Spirit—will not be overlooked.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          At the same time, Scripture warns that not all will be sealed. Outward
          profession or mere religious activity without transformation is not
          enough. Only those who truly obey God and surrender to His Spirit will
          be sealed for eternity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Key Points</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          Faithful in Trial – Those who keep God’s commandments and endure with
          faith in Christ will be sealed.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Sincere Seekers – Honest Christians who accept greater truth when
          revealed will also receive the seal.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Beyond Labels – Even outside organized religion, God honors sincere
          hearts guided by conscience and His Spirit.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Warning – Not all who profess religion will be sealed; only those who
          obey and are transformed.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Heart Over Profession – The seal depends not on membership, but on
          genuine surrender and holiness.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Discussion / Questions</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          Why is God’s sealing not limited to church membership or denomination?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How does Revelation 14:12 describe the kind of faithfulness required
          to receive the seal?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          What does John 10:16 teach us about God’s people who are “outside the
          fold”?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How does Romans 2:14–15 show God’s fairness toward those who have not
          known the full truth?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Why is Matthew 7:21 a warning against relying on outward religion
          instead of true obedience?
        </li>
      </ol>
