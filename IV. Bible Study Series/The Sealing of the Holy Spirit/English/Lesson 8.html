        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Total Consecration of Life, Time, and Resources to God</h2>
      <br />

      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse(Foundation)</p>

      <h2>Matthew 6:33 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all
        these things shall be added unto you.
      </p>

      <h2>1 Corinthians 6:19–20 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which
        is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are
        bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your
        spirit, which are God’s.
      </p>

      <h2>Romans 12:1 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which
        is your reasonable service.
      </p>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Explanation / Expansion</h2>
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          Total consecration means surrendering everything—our bodies, time,
          talents, possessions, ambitions, and plans—to God as an act of
          worship.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The apostle Paul calls this a “living sacrifice”: not a one-time
          ritual, but a daily, ongoing offering of ourselves so that God’s will
          shapes our decisions and priorities.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Consecration transforms how we:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use time → prioritizing prayer, Scripture, service, and
              fellowship.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve → offering gifts and talents to build up others instead of
              seeking self-glory.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve → offering gifts and talents to build up others instead of
              seeking self-glory.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pursue goals → seeking God’s Kingdom first, above personal gain or
              comfort.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          A consecrated life is marked by practical choices: saying “no” to
          compromises, conveniences, or pleasures that dishonor God, and saying
          “yes” to costly obedience, service, and generosity.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          True consecration is not legalism—it is the overflow of love and
          gratitude to Christ.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>We consecrate because we were bought with a price.</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          This response to grace yields transformed character, fruitful service,
          and readiness for the coming Kingdom.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Key Points</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          Whole-Life Worship — Consecration is not limited to church activity;
          it is offering every area of life to God.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Daily, Not Occasional — A “living sacrifice” is an ongoing surrender,
          renewed each day.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Time as Treasure — Our priorities and use of time reveal the state of
          our heart.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Stewardship of Resources — Money, possessions, and opportunities are
          entrusted to us for God’s work.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Gifts for Service — Skills and abilities are meant to build others and
          glorify God.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Costly Obedience — Real consecration often requires sacrifice,
          courage, and choices that align with God’s will.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Fruit of the Spirit — Consecration produces Christlike character,
          practical love, and Kingdom fruitfulness.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Discussion / Questions</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          What does it mean practically for you to “present your body a living
          sacrifice” this week? Name one concrete change you can make.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How do you currently spend most of your time, and how does that
          reflect your consecration to God?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          In what areas of life (money, relationships, career, leisure) do you
          find it hardest to surrender fully to God? Why?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How can our group encourage one another toward greater consecration of
          time, talents, and resources?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Share an example (from Scripture or personal experience) where total
          consecration led to visible blessing or transformation.
        </li>
      </ol>
