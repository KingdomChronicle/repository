        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Timing of the Final Sealing</h2>
      <br />

      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse(Foundation)</p>

      <h2>Revelation 14:12 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
        commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
      </p>

      <h2>Revelation 22:11 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        He that is unjust, let him be unjust still… and he that is righteous,
        let him be righteous still…
      </p>

      <h2>Ephesians 4:30 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the
        day of redemption.
      </p>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Explanation / Expansion</h2>
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          The sealing of God is one of the most decisive events in the final
          chapters of earth’s history.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Scripture reveals that before the Second Coming of the Lord, God marks
          His faithful people with His seal, showing their loyalty and
          obedience.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>The sealing is directly tied to the last great test of worship.</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          A counterfeit system will enforce its mark upon humanity, requiring
          obedience to human authority in opposition to God’s law. In this
          crisis, every person will be compelled to choose: follow God or follow
          man.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          God’s true people will be sealed in their foreheads, symbolizing a
          settled conviction in the mind and heart to obey Him fully.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          God’s true people will be sealed in their foreheads, symbolizing a
          settled conviction in the mind and heart to obey Him fully.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          From that point forward, destinies will be fixed: the righteous sealed
          for redemption, the unrighteous sealed for destruction.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The urgency is clear: now is the time to prepare. Today’s choices are
          shaping character, loyalty, and destiny.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The sealing will not be a sudden surprise, but the culmination of
          daily decisions of faithfulness or compromise.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Key Points</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          Final Test of Worship – The sealing is linked to the end-time crisis
          when enforced worship challenges loyalty to God.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          True Faithfulness – God’s seal is placed on those who obey Him with
          conviction and endurance.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Counterfeit Mark – The mark of the beast represents loyalty to human
          authority above God’s law.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Close of Probation – Once the sealing is finished, destinies are fixed
          forever.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Urgency of Preparation – Every daily decision now is preparing us to
          be either sealed by God or marked by the enemy.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Discussion / Questions</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          What does Revelation 14:12 teach us about the qualities of those who
          will be sealed by God in the final crisis?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Why is the sealing described as a “settled conviction in the mind and
          heart”? How does this differ from outward religion only?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          According to Ephesians 4:30, how is the Holy Spirit connected to the
          sealing of God’s people?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Revelation 22:11 speaks of a time when destinies are fixed. What does
          this reveal about the urgency of preparing before probation closes?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          In light of the “final test of worship,” what daily choices can we
          make now to ensure that our loyalty is firmly on God’s side and not
          with the counterfeit system?
        </li>
      </ol>
