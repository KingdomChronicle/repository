        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Meaning of the Seal</h2>
      <br />

      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse(Foundation)</p>

      <h2>Revelation 7:3 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have
        sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
      </p>

      <h2>Revelation 14:12 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
        commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
      </p>

      <h2>Ephesians 4:30 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the
        day of redemption.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Explanation / Expansion</h2>
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          The Seal of God is one of the most significant signs in the final
          events of earth’s history.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          It is not a physical mark or outward stamp, but a spiritual sign of
          ownership, loyalty, and identity.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Placed on the Forehead (Mind & Choices): In Scripture, the forehead
          symbolizes the seat of thought, conviction, and decision. Being sealed
          on the forehead means one’s mind is fully surrendered to God and
          committed to His will, even under persecution.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Represents Loyalty & Obedience: The Seal identifies God’s faithful
          servants who obey His commandments and live in alignment with His
          truth. It reflects inner transformation and faith motivated by love.
          Unlike the mark of the beast, which represents submission to human
          authority, the Seal signifies complete loyalty to God.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Connected to Redemption & Christ’s Return: The Seal, given by the Holy
          Spirit, marks believers as God’s own until the final day of
          redemption. It assures protection and salvation for those who remain
          faithful until Christ’s Second Coming.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Key Points</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          Spiritual, Not Physical – The Seal is an invisible spiritual mark of
          identity and ownership.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Forehead = Mind – It shows surrendered thoughts, convictions, and
          choices to God’s will.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Proof of Loyalty – The Seal demonstrates obedience, faith, and
          belonging to Christ.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Contrast to the Mark – Unlike the mark of the beast, the Seal belongs
          only to God’s true followers.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Linked to Redemption – The Seal points forward to Christ’s return and
          the final day of salvation.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Discussion / Questions</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          What does it mean that God’s people are sealed “in their foreheads”
          (Revelation 7:3)?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How does Revelation 14:12 describe the kind of life that reflects
          God’s Seal?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          In what way is the Seal of God connected with the Holy Spirit and
          redemption (Ephesians 4:30)?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How is the Seal of God different from the Mark of the Beast, and why
          is this distinction important?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          What practical steps can we take today to ensure our minds and hearts
          are fully surrendered to God?
        </li>
      </ol>
