        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>The 144,000: A Special Prophetic Group</h2>
      <br />

      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse(Foundation)</p>

      <h2>Revelation 14:1–5 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        Revelation 14:1-5 KJV
        <sup>1</sup> And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and
        with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name
        written in their foreheads. <sup>2</sup> And I heard a voice from
        heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great
        thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:
        <sup>3</sup> and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and
        before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song
        but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from
        the earth. <sup>4</sup> These are they which were not defiled with
        women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb
        whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the
        firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. <sup>5</sup> And in their mouth
        was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Explanation / Expansion</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Purity of Loyalty (“Virgins”)</b> <br />
          <br />

          📖 Revelation 14:4a – “These are they which were not defiled with
          women; for they are virgins.” <br /><br />

          This symbolizes spiritual purity, not physical celibacy. They are
          undefiled by false teachings or worldly compromises. Their devotion is
          reserved for Christ alone. <br /><br />

          2 Corinthians 11:2 – “For I have espoused you to one husband, that I
          may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.”
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <b> Unwavering Obedience (“Follow the Lamb”)</b> <br />
          <br />

          📖 Revelation 14:4b – “These are they which follow the Lamb
          whithersoever he goeth.” <br /><br />

          The 144,000 follow Christ completely, not selectively. Their obedience
          is not based on convenience, but on love and loyalty. Even in trials
          or loss, they walk in His steps. <br /><br />

          John 10:27 – “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow
          me.”
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <b>Honesty (“No Deceit”)</b> <br />
          <br />

          📖 Revelation 14:5 – “And in their mouth was found no guile.”
          <br /><br />

          They are truthful and transparent, reflecting the honesty of Christ.
          Their words carry no hypocrisy or deceit. They represent God’s truth
          with integrity. <br /><br />

          Zephaniah 3:13 – “The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor
          speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth.”
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <b>Christlike Character (“Without Fault”)</b> <br />
          <br />

          📖 Revelation 14:5 – “For they are without fault before the throne of
          God.” <br /><br />

          This does not mean human perfection, but transformation through
          Christ’s righteousness. They are refined through trials and stand
          blameless in God’s presence, upheld by grace. <br /><br />

          Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
          present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
          joy.”
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <b>Their Prophetic Role in the End Time:</b> <br />
          <br />

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b><i>Survivors of the Final Crisis:</i></b> <br />
              They endure the last great tribulation—the plagues and global
              deception—but remain faithful. They are described as firstfruits
              (Revelation 14:4), representing the fullness of God’s saving
              power.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b><i>Jacob’s Time of Trouble:</i></b> <br />
              Like Jacob wrestled with the angel (Genesis 32:24–30), they will
              experience deep anguish, clinging to God amid fear and trial. Yet,
              by faith, they will prevail and be delivered.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Key Points</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          The 144,000 are sealed, protected, and preserved during earth’s
          darkest hour.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Their loyalty to God is pure, undivided, and uncorrupted by falsehood.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Their defining marks: purity, obedience, honesty, and Christlikeness.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          They are a prophetic testimony that God can fully transform His
          people.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Discussion / Questions</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          What does “not defiled with women” symbolize in Revelation 14:4? How
          does this relate to spiritual loyalty?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How do we learn to “follow the Lamb wherever He goes” in our daily
          lives?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Why is honesty and transparency such an important mark of God’s
          end-time people?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How can we understand “without fault” not as sinless perfection, but
          as being covered and transformed by Christ’s righteousness?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          In what ways can we prepare spiritually for our own “Jacob’s time of
          trouble,” when faith will be tested to the utmost?
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        ✨ <b>Reflection:</b> <br />
        The 144,000 are not a mysterious elite but a prophetic picture of what
        God longs to do in His people: make them pure, loyal, truthful, and
        Christlike. They reveal that, through God’s grace, humanity can reflect
        heaven’s character even in earth’s final crisis.
