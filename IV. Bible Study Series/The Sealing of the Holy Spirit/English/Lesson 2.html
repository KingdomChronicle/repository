        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>The Sealing is a Definite Event</h2>
      <br />

      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse(Foundation)</p>

      <h2>Revelation 7:2–3 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the
        living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom
        it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, Saying, Hurt not the earth,
        neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our
        God in their foreheads.
      </p>

      <h2>Revelation 13:16–17 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,
        to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that
        no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the
        beast, or the number of his name.”
      </p>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Explanation / Expansion</h2>
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          The sealing is not a slow, symbolic process unfolding over long church
          history. While God continually works in preparing His people, the
          final sealing is a definite, decisive event that takes place just
          before the close of probation and before God’s judgments are released
          upon the earth.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Revelation 7 shows an angel restraining the winds of destruction until
          the servants of God are sealed. This demonstrates God’s mercy and
          urgency—He ensures His people are marked with His seal of protection
          before the great crisis breaks forth.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          At that critical moment, all humanity will be divided into two
          distinct groups:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Those who receive the Seal of the Living God—showing God’s
              ownership, loyalty, and protection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Those who receive the Mark of the Beast—showing allegiance to
              human authority in opposition to God’s law.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          This sealing represents a settling into the truth—both intellectually
          and spiritually—so that God’s people cannot be moved, even in the face
          of persecution.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>It is the final preparation before Christ’s coming.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Key Points</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          The Sealing is Urgent – It must happen before God’s judgments are
          released.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Clear Division – Every person will either receive God’s seal or the
          mark of the beast.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Not Symbolic Growth – The sealing is a final, end-time act, not a
          gradual church process.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Protection & Ownership – God marks His true servants as His own.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Character Stability – The sealing is about being firmly grounded in
          God’s truth, unmoved by deception.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Discussion / Questions</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          According to Revelation 7:2–3, why must God’s people be sealed before
          the winds are released?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          What does the “seal of the living God” represent in a believer’s life?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How is the Mark of the Beast described in Revelation 13:16–17, and
          what does it signify?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Why is the sealing described as a decisive event rather than a slow,
          historical process?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How can we prepare ourselves today to be settled into God’s truth and
          ready for the sealing?
        </li>
      </ol>
