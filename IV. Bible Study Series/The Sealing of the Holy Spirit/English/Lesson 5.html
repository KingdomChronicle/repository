        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>Urgency of Preparation</h2>
      <br />

      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse(Foundation)</p>

      <h2>2 Corinthians 6:2 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        …behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
      </p>

      <h2>Hebrews 3:15 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts…</p>

      <h2>Revelation 22:11 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        He that is unjust, let him be unjust still… and he that is righteous,
        let him be righteous still.
      </p>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Explanation / Expansion</h2>
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          We are now living in the preparation period before the final sealing
          takes place.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The daily choices we make—whether in faithfulness or compromise—are
          shaping our character, loyalty, and eternal destiny.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The story of Lot in Sodom reflects the urgency of preparation (Genesis
          19:15–16). Lot lingered when judgment was near, but the angels urged
          him quickly, even taking him by the hand, because mercy was almost
          over.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Once Lot was outside, the city’s fate was sealed.</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The sealing will not come suddenly without warning; it will be the
          culmination of consistent daily decisions of obedience and faith.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Key Points</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          Time of Lingering – Like Lot, many delay surrender, thinking there is
          still more time.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Mercy is Urging Us Now – God calls through His Spirit, Word, and
          warnings.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Choices Form Destiny – Small decisions build the character that will
          either receive God’s seal or the enemy’s mark.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Finality of Probation – Once the door of mercy closes, destinies
          cannot be changed.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Discussion / Questions</h2>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>
          Why do many people hesitate, like Lot, even when judgment is near?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How is God showing His mercy today to urge people into preparation?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>In what ways do our daily choices shape our eternal destiny?</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          What does the closing of probation (Revelation 22:11) teach us about
          the urgency of surrendering now?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          How can we live with a sense of urgency while also walking in peace
          and faith?
        </li>
      </ol>
