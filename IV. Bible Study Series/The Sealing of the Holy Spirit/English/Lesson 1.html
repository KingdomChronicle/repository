        <p>
          “Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to our weekly
          Bible Study. This is a time we set apart each week to strengthen the
          foundation of our faith in the Word of God. <br /><br />
          The Bible reminds us in 2 Timothy 3:16–17 that ‘All Scripture is given
          by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
          for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’
          <br /><br />
          Our goal in this Bible Study is not only to gain knowledge, but to
          allow God’s Word to transform our lives, shape our character, and draw
          us closer to Christ. <br /><br />

          As we meet each week, we will grow together in understanding,
          encourage one another in faith, and prepare ourselves to stand firm in
          the truth of God’s Kingdom. <br /><br />
          Let us approach this time with open hearts, ready to listen, to learn,
          and to apply His Word in our daily walk.”
        </p>

      <h2>The Gospel of the Kingdom: A Witness to All Nations</h2>
      <br />

      <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse(Foundation)</p>

      <h2>Matthew 24:14 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a
        witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”
      </p>

      <h2>Mark 13:10 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>“And the gospel must first be published among all nations.”</p>

      <h2>Revelation 14:6–7 (KJV)</h2>

      <p>
        “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
        everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to
        every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud
        voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is
        come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the
        fountains of waters.”
      </p>

      <br />
      <hr />
      <h2 class="chapterTitle">Explanation / Expansion</h2>
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          Jesus clearly stated that the end will not come until the Gospel of
          the Kingdom has been proclaimed to all nations.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          This Gospel is not about human religion or traditions but about God’s
          rulership, salvation through Christ, and His coming eternal reign.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The message will serve as a witness to all nations—every people group
          will have the opportunity to hear and respond, whether in acceptance
          or rejection.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Revelation shows this work as part of God’s final call: Fear God, give
          Him glory, and worship the Creator, because His judgment has come.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Once this divine mission is fulfilled, Christ’s return is certain and
          imminent.
        </li>
      </ul>
