<p class="chapterTitle">From the beginning of the public life of Jesus until the first Pasch</p>

 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">Jesus Discourses with Eliud, the Essenian, Upon the Mysteries of the Old Testament and the Most Holy Incarnation</p>
                               

  <p>
 <sup>1</sup> Jesus passed the whole day in most confidential intercourse with Eliud, who asked Him various questions about His mission. <br>
 <sup>2</sup> Jesus explained all to the old man, telling him that He was the Messiah, speaking of the lineage of His human genealogy and the Mystery of the Ark of the Covenant. <br>
 <sup>3</sup> I learned then that that Mystery had, before the flood, been taken into the ark of Noe, that It had descended from generation to generation, disappearing from time to time, but again coming to light. <br>
 <sup>4</sup> Jesus said that Mary at her birth had become the Ark of the Covenant of the Mystery. <br>
 <sup>5</sup> Then Eliud who, during the discourse frequently produced various rolls of writing and pointed out different passages of the Prophets which Jesus explained to him, asked why He, Jesus, had not come sooner upon earth. <br>
 <sup>6</sup> Jesus answered that He could have been born only of a woman who had been conceived in the same way that, were it not for the Fall, all mankind would have been conceived; and that, since the first parents, no married couple had been so pure both in themselves and in their ancestors as Anne and Joachim. <br>
 <sup>7</sup> Then Jesus unfolded the past generations to Eliud, and pointed out to him the obstacles that had delayed Redemption. <br>
 <sup>8</sup>  I learned from this conference many details concerning the Ark of the Covenant. <br>
 <sup>9</sup> Whenever it was in any danger, or whenever there was fear of its falling into enemies’ hands, the Mystery was removed by the priests; yet still was it, the Ark, so holy that its profaners were punished and forced to restore it. <br>
 <sup>10</sup> I saw that the family to whom Moses entrusted the special guardianship of the Ark existed until Herod’s time. <br>
 <sup>11</sup> At the Babylonian Captivity, Jeremias hid the Ark and other sacred things on Mount Sinai. <br>
 <sup>12</sup> They were never afterward found, but the Mystery had been removed. <br>
 <sup>13</sup> A second Ark was, at a later period, constructed on the first model, but it did not contain the sacred objects that had been preserved in the first. <br>
 <sup>14</sup> Aaron’s rod, also a portion of the Mystery were in the keeping of the Essenians on Horeb. <br>
 <sup>15</sup> The Sacrament of the Blessing was, however, but I know not by what priest, again replaced in the Ark. <br>
 <sup>16</sup> In the pit, which was afterward the Pool of Bethsaida, the sacred fire had been preserved. <br>
 <sup>17</sup> I saw in pictures very many things, which Jesus explained to Eliud, and I heard part of the words, but I cannot recall all. <br>
 <sup>18</sup>  He related the fact of His having taken Flesh of the blessed germ of which God had deprived Adam before his fall. <br>
 <sup>19</sup> That blessed germ, by means of which all Israel should have become worthy of Him, had descended through many generations. <br>
 <sup>20</sup> He explained how His corning had been so often retarded, how some of the chosen vessels had become unworthy. <br>
 <sup>21</sup> I saw all this as a reality. <br>
 <sup>22</sup> I saw all the ancestors of Jesus, and how the ancient Patriarchs at their death gave over the Blessing sacramentally to the firstborn. <br>
 <sup>23</sup> I saw that the morsel and the drink out of the holy cup, which Abraham had received from the angel along with the promise of a son, Isaac, were a symbol of the Most Holy Sacrament of the New Covenant, and that their invigorating power was due to the Flesh and Blood of the future Messiah. <br>
 <sup>24</sup> I saw the ancestors of Jesus receiving this Sacrament, in order to contribute to the Incarnation of God; and I saw that Jesus, of the Flesh and Blood received from His forefathers, instituted a most august Sacrament for the uniting of man with God. <br>
 <sup>25</sup>  Jesus spoke much to Eliud also of the sanctity of Anne and Joachim, and of the supernatural Con-ception of Mary under the Golden Gate. <br>
 <sup>26</sup> He told him that not by Joseph had He been conceived, but from Mary according to the flesh; that she had been conceived, of that pure Blessing which had been taken from Adam before the Fall, which through Abraham had descended until it was possessed by Joseph in Egypt, after whose death it had been deposited in the Ark of the Covenant, and thence withdrawn to be handed over to Joachim and Anne. <br>
 <sup>27</sup>  Jesus said that to free man He had been sent in the weakness of humanity; that He received and felt everything like a man; that, like the serpent of Moses in the desert, He would one day be raised up on Mount Calvary where the body of the first man lay buried. <br>
 <sup>28</sup> He referred also to the sad future that awaited Him and to the ingratitude of man. <br>
 <sup>29</sup>  Eliud simply and confidently asked question after question. <br>
 <sup>30</sup> Although he understood all that Jesus said better than did the Apostles, although looking upon things in a more spiritual sense than they, yet all was not clear to him; he could not rightly comprehend how the mission of Jesus was to be accomplished. <br>
 <sup>31</sup> He asked Jesus where His Kingdom was to be, in Jerusalem, in Jericho, or in Engaddi. <br>
 <sup>32</sup> Jesus answered that where He Himself was, there would His Kingdom be, and that He would have no external Kingdom. <br>
 <sup>33</sup>  The old man spoke to Jesus so naturally and simply. <br>
 <sup>34</sup> He related to Him many things of His Mother, as if He knew them not, and Jesus listened to him so kindly. <br>
 <sup>35</sup> He told Him of Joachim and Anne, and spoke of the life and death of the latter. <br>
 <sup>36</sup> Jesus remarked that no woman had ever been more chaste than Anne; that she had married twice after Joachim’s death in accordance with the command of God, for it was proper that the number of fruits destined to be produced by this branch should be filled up. <br>
 <sup>37</sup>  As Eliud recounted the circumstances of Anne’s death, I had a vision of the same. <br>
 <sup>38</sup> I saw her lying on a rather high couch in a back room (something like Mary’s) of her own large house. <br>
 <sup>39</sup> She was unusually animated and talkative, and not at all like a dying person. <br>
 <sup>40</sup> I saw her blessing her little daughters, also her other relatives, who were in the antechamber. <br>
 <sup>41</sup> Mary was standing at the head, Jesus at the foot of her bed. <br>
 <sup>42</sup> Jesus was, at this time, a young man, His beard just beginning to appear. <br>
 <sup>43</sup> Anne blessed Mary, begged the blessing of Jesus, and continued speaking in a joyous strain. <br>
 <sup>44</sup> Suddenly she glanced upward, became white as snow, and I saw drops like pearls starting out on her forehead. <br>
 <sup>45</sup> I cried out: “Ah, she is dying! she is dying!” and, in my eagerness, I wanted to clasp her in my arms. <br>
 <sup>46</sup> Then it seemed to me that she came and rested in them. <br>
 <sup>47</sup> On awaking I still thought that I held her. <br>
 <sup>48</sup>  Eliud related also many things connected with the virtues of Mary in the Temple. <br>
 <sup>49</sup> As he spoke, I saw it all in vision. <br>
 <sup>50</sup> I saw that her teacher Noemi was one of Lazarus’s relatives. <br>
 <sup>51</sup> She was about fifty years old and, like all the other women who served in the Temple, she was an Essenian. <br>
 <sup>52</sup> I saw that Mary learned from her how to knit. <br>
 <sup>53</sup> Even as a child, she used to go with Noemi when the latter went to cleanse the different vessels and utensils that had been soiled with the blood of sacrifice. <br>
 <sup>54</sup> Certain parts of the animal sacrificed were received by them, then cut up and prepared as food for the priests and others who served in the Temple; for they depended in part upon that for support. <br>
 <sup>55</sup> I saw the Blessed Virgin at a later period helping in these duties. <br>
 <sup>56</sup> I saw Zachary, when it was his turn to serve in the sanctuary, visiting the child Mary. <br>
 <sup>57</sup> Simeon, also, knew her. <br>
 <sup>58</sup> And so, as Eliud was recounting it to the Lord, I saw all her pious and lowly serving in the Temple. <br>
 <sup>59</sup>  They spoke, also, of Christ’s conception, and Eliud told of Mary’s visit to Elizabeth. <br>
 <sup>60</sup> Eliud mentioned also a spring that Mary had found there; and that, too, I saw. <br>
 <sup>61</sup> I saw the Blessed Virgin going with Elizabeth, Zachary, and Joseph from Zachary’s house to another little property belonging to him, and on which there was no water. <br>
 <sup>62</sup> The Blessed Virgin went alone into the garden, a little rod in her hand, and prayed. <br>
 <sup>63</sup> She pierced the earth with the rod, and a tiny stream gushed out and flowed around a little knoll. <br>
 <sup>64</sup> When Zachary and Joseph removed the earth with a spade, an abundant supply rushed forth, and soon formed a most beautiful spring. <br>
 <sup>65</sup> Zachary dwelt about five hours southward from Jerusalem, and a little to the west. <br>
 <sup>66</sup>  In confidential discourse like the above, interrupted only by prayer, Eliud treated with Jesus. <br>
 <sup>67</sup> He honored Him, but quite simply and joyously, looking upon Him as a chosen human being. <br>
 <sup>68</sup> Eliud’s daughter did not dwell in the same house with her father, but at some distance in a rocky cavern. <br>
 <sup>69</sup>  There were about twenty Essenians living on the mountain. <br>
 <sup>70</sup> The women dwelt apart from the men, about five or six together. <br>
 <sup>71</sup> All honored Eliud as their Superior and daily assembled around him for prayer. <br>
 <sup>72</sup> Jesus ate with him alone, but very sparingly, their repast consisting of bread, fruit, honey, and fish. <br>
 <sup>73</sup> Weaving and agriculture formed the chief occupation of these people. <br>
 <sup>74</sup>  The mountain at whose base the Essenians dwelt, was the highest peak of a ridge on one of whose plateaus Nazareth was built. <br>
 <sup>75</sup> A valley lay between it and the city. <br>
 <sup>76</sup> On the other side the descent was steep and overgrown with verdure and grapevines. <br>
 <sup>77</sup> The abyss at its base, the one into which the Pharisees at a later period wanted to precipitate Jesus, was full of all kinds of rubbish, ordure, and bones. <br>
 <sup>78</sup> Mary’s house stood on a hill outside the city, part of it extending into the hill like a cave. <br>
 <sup>79</sup> The top of the house, however, arose above the hill, on the opposite side of which lay other dwellings. <br>
 <sup>80</sup> Mary and the other women accompanied by Colaya, Lea’s son, arrived at her house in the valley of Capharnaum. <br>
 <sup>81</sup> Her female friends in the neighborhood came out to meet her. <br>
 <sup>82</sup> Mary’s dwelling at Capharnaum belonged to a man named Levi, who lived in a large house not very far from it. <br>
 <sup>83</sup> It had been rented from Levi by Peter’s family and given over to the Holy Family; for Peter and Andrew knew the Holy Family in a general way, also through John the Baptist, whose disciples they were. <br>
 <sup>84</sup> The house had several buildings attached to it in which relatives of the family and the disciples could stay when visiting the Holy Family. <br>
 <sup>85</sup> It appeared to have been chosen on that account. <br>
 <sup>86</sup> Mary Cleophas had with her her little boy Simeon, about two years old, the son of her third marriage. <br>
 <sup>87</sup> Toward evening Jesus accompanied Eliud from his house to Nazareth. <br>
 <sup>88</sup> Outside the city walls, where Joseph had had his carpenter shop, lived several people, poor but good, who had been known to Joseph, and among whose sons were some of the playmates of Jesus’ childhood. <br>
 <sup>89</sup> Eliud took Jesus to visit these people. <br>
 <sup>90</sup> They offered their guests a morsel of bread and a little fresh water. <br>
 <sup>91</sup> The water was especially good in Nazareth. <br>
 <sup>92</sup> I saw Jesus sitting on the ground among them and exhorting them to go to the baptism of John. <br>
 <sup>93</sup> They acted somewhat shyly in Jesus’ regard. <br>
 <sup>94</sup> They had in the past looked upon Him as one of themselves. <br>
 <sup>95</sup> But now that He was so gravely introduced to them by Eliud, whom they all so highly honored, whose advice they often asked, from whom they were accustomed to seek consolation, and who, moreover, united in persuading them to go to the baptism, they could scarcely reconcile themselves to the position He now held toward them. <br>
 <sup>96</sup> They had indeed heard of the Messiah, but they could hardly think that Jesus was He. </p><br>


<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus and Eliud Walking and Conversing Together</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> The next day Jesus went with Eliud southward from Nazareth through the valley of Esdrelon on the road to Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>2</sup> When about two hours beyond the brook Kison, they arrived at a village consisting of a synagogue, an inn, and only a few houses. <br>
<sup>3</sup> It was one of the environs of the not far distant Endor, and nearby was a celebrated spring. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Jesus put up at the inn. <br>
<sup>5</sup> The people of the place behaved rather coldly, though not inimically toward Him. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Eliud was not held in special esteem by them, for they were rather pharisaical. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Jesus notified their head men that He intended to teach in the synagogue, but they replied that that was not usual for strangers. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Jesus told them that He had a special call to do so and, entering the school, He taught of the Messiah whose Kingdom was not of this world, whose coming would not be attended by outward splendor, also of John’s baptism. <br>
<sup>9</sup> The priests of the synagogue were not favorably inclined toward Jesus. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Jesus bade them give Him the Scriptures. <br>
<sup>11</sup> He unrolled them and explained many passages from the Prophets. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Eliud’s confident communications with Jesus were to me singularly touching. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He knew of and believed in His mission and supernatural advent, still without appearing to have a suspicion that He was God Himself. <br>
<sup>14</sup> He told Jesus quite naturally, as they walked together, many things connected with His youth, what the Prophetess Anna had related to him, also what she had heard from Mary after the return from Egypt, for Mary had sometimes visited her in Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Jesus, in turn, related to Eliud some things that he did not know, each accompanied with significant inter-pretation. <br>
<sup>16</sup> But all was so natural, so simple, like a dear old man speaking with a beloved young friend. <br>
<sup>17</sup> While Eliud was rehearsing what Anna had heard from Mary and told to him, I saw all in pictures. <br>
<sup>18</sup> I rejoiced to find them exactly similar to what I had long before seen and partly forgotten. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Jesus spoke to Eliud also of His journey to the baptism. <br>
<sup>20</sup> He had gathered together many people and sent them to the desert near Ophra; but He said that He would go alone by the road past Bethania, where He wanted to speak with Lazarus. <br>
<sup>21</sup> He spoke of Lazarus by another general name, which I have forgotten. <br>
<sup>22</sup> He mentioned also his father, saying that he had been in war. <br>
<sup>23</sup> He said that Lazarus and his sisters were rich, and that they would devote all they had to the advancement of Redemption. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Lazarus had three sisters: the eldest Martha, the youngest Mary Magdalen, and one between them also called Mary. <br>
<sup>25</sup> This last lived altogether secluded, her silence causing her to be looked upon as a simpleton. <br>
<sup>26</sup> She went by no other name than Silent Mary. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Jesus, speaking to Eliud of this family, said, “Martha is good and pious. <br>
<sup>28</sup> She will, with her brother, follow Me. <br>
<sup>29</sup>  Of Mary the Silent, He said, “She is possessed of great mind and understanding; but, for the good of her soul, they have been withdrawn from her. <br>
<sup>30</sup> She is not for this world, therefore is she now altogether secluded from it. <br>
<sup>31</sup> But she has never committed sin. <br>
<sup>32</sup> If I should speak to her, she would perfectly comprehend the greatest mysteries. <br>
<sup>33</sup> She will not live much longer. <br>
<sup>34</sup> After her death, Lazarus and his sister Martha will follow me and devote all that they possess to the use of the Community. <br>
<sup>35</sup> The youngest sister Mary has strayed from the right path, but she will return and rise to higher sanctity than Martha. <br>
<sup>36</sup> Eliud spoke also of John the Baptist, but he had not yet seen him and was not yet baptized. <br>
<sup>37</sup> Jesus and Eliud spent the night at the inn near the synagogue, and early on the following morning, they journeyed along Mount Hermon toward the somewhat dilapidated city of Endor. <br>
<sup>38</sup> Around the inns lay masses of broken walls all the way along the mountain’ so broad that a wagon could pass over them. <br>
<sup>39</sup> Endor was full of ruins interspersed with gardens. <br>
<sup>40</sup> On one side were large, magnificent buildings like palaces, while in other quarters of the city the desolation of war was visible. <br>
<sup>41</sup> It seemed to me that the inhabitants were a race apart from the Jews. <br>
<sup>42</sup> There was no synagogue in Endor, so Jesus went with Eliud to a large square in which three side buildings containing small chambers were built around a pond. <br>
<sup>43</sup> The pond was in the center of a green lawn, and on its waters little barks were sailing. <br>
<sup>44</sup> There was a pump nearby, and the place bore the appearance of a health giving resort. <br>
<sup>45</sup> The little chambers around the pond were occupied by invalids. <br>
<sup>46</sup> Jesus, accompanied by Eliud, entered one of the buildings. <br>
<sup>47</sup> He was hospitably received, and His feet washed. <br>
<sup>48</sup> A high seat was erected for Him on the lawn, and there He taught the people. <br>
<sup>49</sup> The women who occupied one of the wings, took back seats in the audience. <br>
<sup>50</sup> These people were not orthodox Jews. <br>
<sup>51</sup> They were more like slaves, cast out and oppressed, who had to pay tribute of all that they earned. <br>
<sup>52</sup> After a certain war, they remained behind in the city. <br>
<sup>53</sup> I think their leader, Sisara, was defeated not far off, and was then murdered by a woman. <br>
<sup>54</sup>  His army had been scattered throughout the whole country and reduced to servitude. <br>
<sup>55</sup> There were still about four hundred in these parts. <br>
<sup>56</sup> Their fore-fathers had, under David and Solomon, been forced to quarry stones for the building of the Temple. <br>
<sup>57</sup> They were long accustomed to such work. <br>
<sup>58</sup> The deceased King Herod had employed them in building an aqueduct to Mount Sion of several hours in length. <br>
<sup>59</sup> They were very compassionate and stood by one another under all circumstances. <br>
<sup>60</sup> They wore long coats and girdles. <br>
<sup>61</sup> Their pointed caps covered their ears like those of the ancient hermits. <br>
<sup>62</sup> They had no communication with the Jews, although they were allowed to send their children to the Jewish schools. <br>
<sup>63</sup> But the poor little creatures were so badly treated and so despised that the parents preferred keeping them home. <br>
<sup>64</sup> Jesus felt great compassion for them. <br>
<sup>65</sup> He had the sick brought to Him. <br>
<sup>66</sup> They sat in a kind of bed like my reclining chair (I can still see them), under the movable back of which were supports. <br>
<sup>67</sup> When the back was let down, the chair formed a bed. <br>
<sup>68</sup> As Jesus instructed them about the Messiah and baptism and exhorted them to the latter, they answered timidly that they could not lay claim to such a privilege, for that they were only poor outcasts. <br>
<sup>69</sup> Then He taught them by the parable of the unjust steward. <br>
<sup>70</sup> The clear interpretation He gave of it, I perfectly understood. <br>
<sup>71</sup> It haunted me the whole day, but now I have forgotten it. <br>
<sup>72</sup> Perhaps I shall recall it again. <br>
<sup>73</sup> Jesus also related the parable of the son sent by his father to take possession of his vineyard. <br>
<sup>74</sup> He always related that when instructing the poor, neglected heathens. <br>
<sup>75</sup> The people prepared a repast for Jesus out in the open air. <br>
<sup>76</sup> He invited to it the poor and the sick, and He and Eliud served them at table. <br>
<sup>77</sup> This action greatly impressed His entertainers. <br>
<sup>78</sup> That evening Jesus returned with Eliud to the place outside of Nazareth, where He stayed overnight and celebrated the Sabbath in the synagogue. <br>
<sup>79</sup> The following day, Jesus and Eliud returned to Endor, which was only a Sabbath distance from the inn, and there He taught. <br>
<sup>80</sup> The inhabitants were Canaanites and, I think, from Sichem; for I heard that day, at least once, the name Sichemite. <br>
<sup>81</sup> They had an idol hidden away in a subterranean cavern. <br>
<sup>82</sup> By some kind of mechanism on springs, it could be made to rise suddenly out of the earth and seat itself on an altar beautifully ornamented and prepared to receive it. <br>
<sup>83</sup> They had procured this idol from Egypt, and it was named Astarte, which I understood yesterday to be the same as Esther. <br>
<sup>84</sup> The idol had a face round like the moon. <br>
<sup>85</sup> On its outstretched arms it held something long and swathed, like the chrysalis of a butterfly, large in the middle and tapering at either end. <br>
<sup>86</sup> It may have been a fish. <br>
<sup>87</sup> On the back of the idol was a pedestal upon which stood a high pail, or a small half-tub, which extended over the head. <br>
<sup>88</sup> In it was something like ears in green husks, also fruits and green leaves. <br>
<sup>89</sup> The idol stood in a cask that reached up to the lower part of the body, and all around it were pots of growing plants. <br>
<sup>90</sup> These people worshipped their idol in secret, and Jesus in His instructions to them reprehended them for it. <br>
<sup>91</sup> They had been accustomed to sacrifice deformed children to the goddess. <br>
<sup>92</sup> There was a companion idol belonging to this goddess, the god Adonis, who I think was Astarte’s husband. <br>
<sup>93</sup> This nation, as has been said, had been defeated in three parts under their general Sisara, and scat-tered as slaves throughout the country. <br>
<sup>94</sup> They were at this time greatly oppressed and despised. <br>
<sup>95</sup> Not very long before Christ, they had excited some disturbance around Herod’s castle in Galilee, after which they were still more oppressed. <br>
<sup>96</sup> In the afternoon, Jesus and Eliud returned to the synagogue and there ended the Sabbath. <br>
<sup>97</sup> The Jews, meanwhile, were very much displeased at Jesus’ visit to Endor. <br>
<sup>98</sup> But He reprehended them very severely for their hardheartedness toward their abandoned fellow beings. <br>
<sup>99</sup> He exhorted them to a spirit of kindness and urged them to take them to the baptism, which they themselves had, at His recommendation, resolved to receive. <br>
<sup>100</sup> The Jews of this place became more favorably inclined toward Jesus after they had heard His instructions. <br>
<sup>101</sup> Toward evening He returned to Nazareth with Eliud. <br>
<sup>102</sup> I saw them conversing together the whole way, sometimes even pausing to stand and talk. <br>
<sup>103</sup> Eliud was again recalling many of the incidents of the flight into Egypt, and I saw them again in vision. <br>
<sup>104</sup> He began by asking whether Jesus was not going to extend His Kingdom over the good people in Egypt who had been impressed by His presence among them in His childhood. <br>
<sup>105</sup> Here I saw again that the journey of Jesus after the raising of Lazarus through pagan Asia down to Egypt, and which I had seen before, was no dream of mine, for Jesus told Eliud that wherever the seed had been sown, would He before His end reap the harvest. <br>
<sup>106</sup> Eliud knew of the sacrifice of bread and wine, also of Melchisedech; but he knew not what idea to form of Jesus. <br>
<sup>107</sup> He questioned Him as to whether He was not another Melchisedech. <br>
<sup>108</sup> Jesus answered: “No. <br>
<sup>109</sup> Melchisedech had to pave the way for My sacrifice. <br>
<sup>110</sup> But I shall be the Sacrifice itself. <br>
<sup>111</sup> I learned also from that conversation that Noemi, Mary’s teacher in the Temple, was the aunt of Lazarus, his mother’s sister. <br>
<sup>112</sup> Lazarus’ father was the son of a Syrian king who had, for services in war, received some property as a reward. <br>
<sup>113</sup> His wife was a Jewess of distinction. <br>
<sup>114</sup> She belonged to the priestly race of Aaron (although Manasses allied with Anna), and dwelt in Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>115</sup> They owned three castles: one in Bethania; one near Herodium; and one at Magdalum, on the Sea of Galilee, not far from Tiberias and Gabara. <br>
<sup>116</sup> Herod also had a castle in the country near Magdalum. <br>
<sup>117</sup> Jesus and Eliud spoke also of the scandal Magdalen gave her family. <br>
<sup>118</sup> Jesus went home with Eliud. <br>
<sup>119</sup> There they found assembled the five disciples, the Essenians, and many others who were desirous of going to the baptism. <br>
<sup>120</sup> Some publicans, also, had come to Nazareth for the same purpose, and several bands had already started for the place of baptism.</p> <br>



<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus in Nazareth</p>

 <p>
<sup>1</sup> Next morning Jesus resumed His instructions. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Two of the Pharisees from Nazareth came to Him and, in a friendly manner, invited Him to go back with them to the school. <br>
<sup>3</sup> They had, as they said, heard so much of His teaching in the country around that they were eager to hear Him explain the Prophets. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Jesus went with them. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They conducted Him to the house of a Pharisee, in which many others were assembled. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The five disciples were with their Master. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The Pharisees listened very politely to Jesus while He spoke to them in beautiful parables. <br>
<sup>8</sup> His teaching appeared to please them greatly, and they led Him to the synagogue, where a numerous audience awaited Him. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Jesus spoke of Moses and explained the Prophecies concerning the Messiah. <br>
<sup>10</sup> But whenever He dropped any words from which they might infer that He alluded to Himself, they showed displeasure. <br>
<sup>11</sup> One of the Pharisees spread for Him a repast, and He spent the night with His five disciples at an inn near the school. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Next day Jesus addressed a crowd of publicans who were journeying just then to receive the bap-tism. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He afterward taught in the synagogue, making use of the similitude of the grain of wheat which must die in the earth before producing its fruit. <br>
<sup>14</sup> His words displeased the Pharisees, and they repeated their remarks about the son of the carpenter Joseph. <br>
<sup>15</sup> They reproached Him also for His communications with publicans and sinners, to which Jesus replied with great firmness. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Then they took up the Essenians whom they denominated hypocrites who lived not according to the Law. <br>
<sup>17</sup> But Jesus showed them clearly that the Essenians were stricter followers of the Law than the Pharisees, and so the reproach of hypocrisy fell back upon themselves. <br>
<sup>18</sup> It was the question of benedictions that had led to the Essenians. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Blessings were in common use among them, and the Pharisees were annoyed at seeing Jesus blessing little children. <br>
<sup>20</sup> When, for instance, He was entering or leaving the synagogue, He was stopped by many mothers with their children, and His blessing craved for the little ones. <br>
<sup>21</sup> While Jesus dwelt at Nazareth, He had always much to do with the children, who became still and quiet near Him. <br>
<sup>22</sup> No matter how passionately they cried, His blessing had power to calm them. <br>
<sup>23</sup> The mothers, remembering this, now brought their little ones to Him to see whether He had become too proud to notice them. <br>
<sup>24</sup> There were some among them who kicked violently, rolling over and over on the floor, as if they had cramps, screaming loudly all the while. <br>
<sup>25</sup> But Jesus’ blessing stilled them instantly. <br>
<sup>26</sup> I saw something like a dark vapor going out from some of them. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Jesus laid His hand on the heads of the boys and gave them the Patriarchs’ blessing in three lines, one from the head and one from either shoulder down to the heart where all three united. <br>
<sup>28</sup> He blessed the girls in the same way, but without laying His hand on them, though He made a sign on their lips. <br>
<sup>29</sup> I thought as I saw Him do it that it meant that they should not prattle so much; still, however, it was significant of something else. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Jesus passed the night with His disciples in the house of a Pharisee.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus Rejects Three Rich Youths. He Confounds Many Learned Men In the Synagogue of Nazareth</p>

 <p>
<sup>1</sup> To the five followers of Jesus, four others were now added, relatives and friends of the Holy Fam-ily. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I think there was a son of one of the three widows among them, and one from Bethlehem, who had found out that He was a descendant of Ruth who had married Booz in that city. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Jesus formally received them to the number of His disciples. <br>
<sup>4</sup> There were in Nazareth a couple of rich families who had three sons. <br>
<sup>5</sup> In childhood these latter had associated with Jesus. <br>
<sup>6</sup> They were now quite cultured and well educated. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The parents, who had heard much of Jesus’ wisdom and teaching, agreed together that their sons should today hear a specimen of it. <br>
<sup>8</sup> They would then offer Him money to let the young men travel with Him that they might profit by His knowledge. <br>
<sup>9</sup> The good people had so high an opinion of their sons that they thought Jesus would gladly become their tutor. <br>
<sup>10</sup> So the young men went to the synagogue whither, by the connivance of their wealthy parents and the Pharisees, all the learned men of the city had flocked. <br>
<sup>11</sup> They were determined to put Jesus to the test in every way. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Among these men were a lawyer and a physician, the latter a tall, portly man with a long beard. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He wore a girdle and had some kind of a badge upon one shoulder of his mantle. <br>
<sup>14</sup> I saw Jesus, on entering the school, again blessing many children whom their mothers brought to Him, among them some afflicted with leprosy whom He healed. <br>
<sup>15</sup> During His discourse, He was interrupted in various ways by the literati who proposed to Him all kinds of subtle questions. <br>
<sup>16</sup> But His wisdom silenced them. <br>
<sup>17</sup> To the lawyer’s speech, Jesus answered most wonderfully from the Law of Moses, and when divorce was spoken of, He rejected it entirely. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Divorced, husband and wife could never be; but if the former could not in any way live with the latter, he might leave her. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Still were they one body, and could not again marry. <br>
<sup>20</sup> These words of the Lord greatly displeased the Jews. <br>
<sup>21</sup> The physician asked whether He could tell whether a man was of a dry, matter-of-fact nature or of a phlegmatic disposition, under what planets such a one was born, what simples were good for this or that temperament, and how the human body is formed. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Jesus answered him with great wisdom. <br>
<sup>23</sup> He spoke of the complexion of some of those present, their diseases and the remedies, and of the human body, with a depth of knowledge quite unknown to the physician. <br>
<sup>24</sup> He spoke of life, of the spirit, and how it influences the body, of sicknesses that could be cured only by prayer and amendment, of such as needed medicine for their cure—and that in language so profound, and yet so beautiful, that the physician in astonishment declared himself vanquished and that he had never before heard such things. <br>
<sup>25</sup> I think he afterward became one of Jesus’ disciples. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Jesus described to him the human body with all its members, muscles, veins, nerves, and intestines, their special functions and their various relations one with another, in general terms and yet with such accuracy that His questioner was humbled and silenced. <br>
<sup>27</sup> There was an astrologer present who spoke of the course of the stars. <br>
<sup>28</sup> He explained how one constellation ruled another, how different stars possess different influences, and he discoursed upon comets and the signs of the Zodiac. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Jesus in most appropriate language treated with another upon architecture; with others of trade and commerce with foreign nations, taking occasion at the same time to censure severely the various fashions and frivolities lately introduced from Athens. <br>
<sup>30</sup> He condemned likewise the games and juggling now in use among them, and which were also spreading throughout Nazareth and other places. <br>
<sup>31</sup> These games were likewise a product of their intercourse with Athens. <br>
<sup>32</sup> Jesus stigmatized them as unpardonable since they that indulge in them look upon them as no sin; consequently, they do no penance for them, and therefore they cannot be pardoned. <br>
<sup>33</sup> His hearers were ravished at His wisdom. <br>
<sup>34</sup> They begged Him to take up His residence among them, offering to give Him a house and all that He needed, questioning Him also as to why He and His Mother had removed to Capharnaum. <br>
<sup>35</sup> Jesus replied that He could not remain with them, and He spoke of His mission and the duties it imposed. <br>
<sup>36</sup> In answer to their question as to why He had gone from among them, He said that it was because of His desire to dwell in a more central locality, etc. <br>
<sup>37</sup> But they did not understand His reasons, and they were offended at His rejection of their offer, which they thought a very fine one. <br>
<sup>38</sup> They looked upon His words, and as the offspring of pride. <br>
<sup>39</sup> And so they left the school that evening. <br>
<sup>40</sup> The three youths, who were about the age of twenty, greatly desired to speak with Jesus. <br>
<sup>41</sup> But He would not allow them to do so until His nine disciples were present. <br>
<sup>42</sup> That annoyed them. <br>
<sup>43</sup> Jesus told them that He insisted upon having witnesses to what He might say to them. <br>
<sup>44</sup> When at last they were admitted to an audience, they very modestly and humbly laid before Him their own and their parent’s wishes that He would receive them as His pupils. <br>
<sup>45</sup> Their parents, they said, would remunerate Him, and as for themselves, they would bear Him company in all His labors, they would serve and help Him. <br>
<sup>46</sup> I saw that Jesus was troubled at having to refuse their request, partly for their own sake, and partly on account of His disciples, for He was obliged to assign reasons for His refusal which they could not as yet comprehend. <br>
<sup>47</sup> He replied to the youths that he who gave money to obtain something, aimed at gaining some temporal advantage; but that whoever would follow Him, must abandon all earthly possessions, must leave parents and friends, and that His disciples must neither woo nor marry. <br>
<sup>48</sup> He laid down many other hard conditions, so that the young men became very much discouraged. <br>
<sup>49</sup> They argued that many of the Essenians were married. <br>
<sup>50</sup> Jesus replied that they, the Essenians, acted rightly and in accordance with their laws, but that His doctrine was to accomplish fully that for which theirs only paved the way, etc. <br>
<sup>51</sup> With this remark and bidding them take time to reflect, He left them. <br>
<sup>52</sup> The disciples were intimidated by His words. <br>
<sup>53</sup> His teaching was so severe that they could not understand it, and they grew fainthearted. <br>
<sup>54</sup> But on the way from Nazareth to Eliud’s, He bade them not despond, that He had good reasons for talking as He had done, that those youths would only at some distant day, and perhaps never, come to Him; but as for themselves, the disciples, they should follow Him calmly and be without anxiety, etc. <br>
<sup>55</sup> And so they arrived at Eliud’s. <br>
<sup>56</sup> I do not think He will again go to Eliud’s, for great talk and excitement had arisen in Nazareth on His account. <br>
<sup>57</sup> The inhabitants were vexed at His not remaining among them. <br>
<sup>58</sup> They thought that He had acquired all His knowledge during His travels. <br>
<sup>59</sup> “True,” they said, “He is a very clever and extraordinary man; but, for a carpenter’s son, He is rather conceited. <br>
<sup>60</sup>  I saw the three young men returning to their homes. <br>
<sup>61</sup> Their parents were very much displeased at the objections Jesus made to receiving them. <br>
<sup>62</sup> The sons chimed in with the parents, and all talked at random in their indignation against Him. <br>
<sup>63</sup> On the following day, the three youths went again to Jesus and begged once more to be accepted. <br>
<sup>64</sup> They promised Him perfect obedience and faithful service. <br>
<sup>65</sup> But Jesus again dismissed them, and I saw that their inability to seize the meaning of His refusal troubled Him. <br>
<sup>66</sup> He spoke then with His nine disciples who, by His directions, were to go first to a certain place and afterward to John. <br>
<sup>67</sup> On the subject of those whom He had dismissed, Jesus said that they desired to follow Him for the sake of what they might gain, that they were not willing to give all for love. <br>
<sup>68</sup> But that they, the disciples, sought for nothing, consequently they had been received. <br>
<sup>69</sup> He spoke again in significant and beautiful terms of the baptism, telling them to go over to Capharnaum and say to His Mother that He was going to the baptism. <br>
<sup>70</sup> He charged them likewise to speak to the disciples, John, Peter, and Andrew about John (the Baptist) and say to the last named that He (Jesus) was coming.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus with Eliud In the Leper Settlement</p>

 <p>
<sup>1</sup> I saw Jesus journeying with Eliud in a southwesterly direction from Nazareth, but not exactly on the highroad. <br>
<sup>2</sup> He wanted to go to Chim, a leper settlement. <br>
<sup>3</sup> They reached it at daybreak, and I saw that Eliud tried to restrain Jesus from entering it, that He might not be defiled; for, as Eliud urged, if it were discovered that He had been there, He would not be allowed to go to the baptism. <br>
<sup>4</sup> But Jesus replied that He knew His mission, that He would enter, for there was in it a good man who was sighing for His coming. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They had to cross the Kishon. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The leper settlement lay near a brook formed by the waters of the Kishon which flowed into a little pond in which the lepers bathed. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The water thus used did not return into the Kishon. <br>
<sup>8</sup> This settlement was perfectly isolated; no one ever approached it. <br>
<sup>9</sup> The lepers dwelt in scattered huts. <br>
<sup>10</sup> There were no others in the place, excepting those that attended the infected. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Eliud remained at a distance and waited for the Lord. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Jesus entered one of the most remote huts wherein lay stretched on the ground a miserable creature entirely enveloped in sheets. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He was a good man. <br>
<sup>14</sup> I have forgotten how he contracted leprosy. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Jesus addressed him. <br>
<sup>16</sup> He raised himself, and appeared to be deeply touched at the Lord’s deigning to visit him. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Jesus commanded him to rise and stretch himself in a trough of water that stood near the hut. <br>
<sup>18</sup> He obeyed, while Jesus held His hands extended over the water. <br>
<sup>19</sup> The rigid limbs of the leper relaxed, and he was made clean. <br>
<sup>20</sup> He then resumed his ordinary dress, and Jesus commanded him not to speak of his cure until He should have returned from the baptism. <br>
<sup>21</sup> He accompanied Jesus and Eliud along the road till Jesus ordered him to go back. <br>
<sup>22</sup> I saw Jesus and Eliud the whole day journeying toward the south through the valley of Esdrelon. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Sometimes they conversed together, and at others walked apart as if in prayer and meditation. <br>
<sup>24</sup> The weather was not very pleasant at that time, the sky dark, and fog in the valley. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Jesus had no stick. <br>
<sup>26</sup> He never carried one. <br>
<sup>27</sup> But Eliud had one with a little shovel on it like those of the shepherds. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Jesus wore only sandals, though a kind of perfect shoe, consisting of a thick, woven upper of coarse cotton, was in use at the time. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Once I saw Jesus and Eliud at noon resting by a well and eating bread.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus Transfigured Before Eliud</p>

 <p>
<sup>1</sup> During the night, I saw them again walking, sometimes together, sometimes separate. <br>
<sup>2</sup> And then I witnessed something extraordinary, an unspeakably lovely vision. <br>
<sup>3</sup> While Jesus was walking on ahead, Eliud passed some remarks upon the symmetry and beauty of His person. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Jesus replied: “If thou shouldst behold this Body two years hence, thou wouldst find in it neither beauty nor symmetry, so greatly will they abuse and maltreat Me. <br>
<sup>5</sup>  But Eliud understood not His words. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Above all he could not comprehend why Jesus always spoke of His Kingdom as existing so short a time; for he thought ten, or even twenty years must elapse before it would be founded. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He could not bring himself to think otherwise, since his thoughts were all of an earthly kingdom. <br>
<sup>8</sup> When they had gone on a short distance, Jesus paused and bade Eliud, who was following lost in thought, to approach and He would show him who He was, of what nature was His Body, and of what kind His Kingdom. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Eliud drew near to within several steps of Jesus. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Then Jesus raised His eyes to Heaven and prayed. <br>
<sup>11</sup> A cloud, like those seen in a thunderstorm, descended and enveloped both. <br>
<sup>12</sup> From without they could not be seen, but over them opened a Heaven of light which seemed to descend toward them. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Above I saw a city of shining walls, I saw the Heavenly Jerusalem! The whole interior was lit up with a rainbow colored light. <br>
<sup>14</sup> I saw a figure like God the Father, and Jesus, His form perfectly luminous and transparent, connected with Him by beams of light. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Eliud stood awhile gazing upward as if entranced, and then sank prostrate on his face, in which position he remained until the apparition and the light had melted away. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Then Jesus resumed His way, and Eliud followed speechless and frightened by what he had seen. <br>
<sup>17</sup> It was a vision like the Trans-figuration, but I did not see Jesus lifted up. <br>
<sup>18</sup> I think Eliud did not live to see the Crucifixion of Christ. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Jesus was more confidential toward him than toward the Apostles, for Eliud was very enlightened and very familiar with many of the mysteries connected with the family of Jesus. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Jesus took him as a friend and companion, and clothed him with authority, so that he did much for His community. <br>
<sup>21</sup> He was one of the best instructed of the Essenians. <br>
<sup>22</sup> In Jesus’ time, the Essenians did not dwell all together on the mountains as formerly; they were more scattered throughout the cities. <br>
<sup>23</sup> I had that wonderful vision about twelve o’clock at night. <br>
<sup>24</sup> In the morning, I saw Jesus and Eliud arrive at a shepherd field. <br>
<sup>25</sup> It was daybreak, and the shepherds were already out of their huts and with the cattle. <br>
<sup>26</sup> They came forward to meet Jesus, who was known to them. <br>
<sup>27</sup> They cast themselves down before Him, and then led Him and His companion under a shed where they had their cooking utensils. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Here they washed their feet, prepared for them a couch, and set before them bread and little drinking cups. <br>
<sup>29</sup> They roasted some turtledoves for their guests. <br>
<sup>30</sup> The birds had their nests in the roofs of the huts, and were hopping around in great numbers like hens. <br>
<sup>31</sup> And now I saw Jesus dismissing Eliud, who knelt to receive His blessing. <br>
<sup>32</sup> The shepherds were present. <br>
<sup>33</sup> Jesus told him that he would end his days in peace, that the path which He Himself had to walk would be too difficult for him, that He had admitted him to His Community, that he had already done his part in the vineyard, and that he should receive his reward in His Kingdom. <br>
<sup>34</sup> Jesus explained this by the parable of the laborers in the vineyards. <br>
<sup>35</sup> Eliud was very grave since the vision of the preceding night, very silent, and deeply impressed. <br>
<sup>36</sup> I think he was afterward baptized by the disciples. <br>
<sup>37</sup> He accompanied Jesus a part of the way from the shepherd field. <br>
<sup>38</sup> The Lord embraced him, and he departed with signs of manly emotion. <br>
<sup>39</sup> The place to which Jesus was going for the Sabbath could be seen from here. <br>
<sup>40</sup> Some of His relatives once dwelt there. <br>
<sup>41</sup> The place to which He now went alone was called Gur. <br>
<sup>42</sup> It was built on a mountain. <br>
<sup>43</sup> Joseph’s brother, who afterward removed to Zabulon and who had had frequent communication with the Holy Family, once dwelt there. <br>
<sup>44</sup> Jesus went unnoticed to an inn, where they washed His feet and presented Him food. <br>
<sup>45</sup> He had a chamber to Himself. <br>
<sup>46</sup> He caused a roll of the Scriptures to be brought to Him from the synagogue, and out of it He read and prayed sometimes standing, sometimes kneeling, often raising His eyes toward Heaven. <br>
<sup>47</sup> He did not go to the school. <br>
<sup>48</sup> Once I saw some people going to the inn and asking to speak to Jesus, but He would not see them.</p><br>
