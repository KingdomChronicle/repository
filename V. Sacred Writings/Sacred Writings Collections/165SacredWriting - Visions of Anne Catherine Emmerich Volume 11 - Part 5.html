<p class="chapterTitle">The bitter Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Mary in the House of Caiphas.</p>


<p>
<sup>1</sup> The Blessed Virgin was ever united to her Divine Son by interior spiritual communications; she was, therefore, fully aware of all that happened to him—she suffered with him, and joined in his continual prayer for his murderers.<br>
<sup>2</sup> But her maternal feelings prompted her to supplicate Almighty God most ardently not to suffer the crime to be completed, and to save her Son from such dreadful torments.<br>
<sup>3</sup> She eagerly desired to return to him; and when John, who had left the tribunal at the moment the frightful cry, ‘He is guilty of death,’ was raised, came to the house of Lazarus to see after her, and to relate the particulars of the dreadful scene he had just witnessed, she, as also Magdalen and some of the other holy women, begged to be taken to the place where Jesus was suffering.<br>
<sup>4</sup> John, who had only left our Saviour in order to console her whom he loved best next to his Divine Master, instantly acceded to their request, and conducted them through the streets, which were lighted up by the moon alone, and crowded with persons hastening to their home.<br>
<sup>5</sup> The holy women were closely veiled; but the sobs which they could not restrain made many who passed by observe them, and their feelings were harrowed by the abusive epithets they overheard bestowed upon Jesus by those who were conversing on the subject of his arrest.<br>
<sup>6</sup> The Blessed Virgin, who ever beheld in spirit the opprobrious treatment which her dear Son was receiving, continued ‘to lay up all these things in her heart;’ like him she suffered in silence; but more than once she became totally unconscious.<br>
<sup>7</sup> Some disciples of Jesus, who were returning from the hall of Caiphas, saw her fainting in the arms of the holy women, and, touched with pity, stopped to look at her compassionately, and saluted her in these words: ‘Hail! Unhappy Mother—hail, Mother of the Most Holy One of Israel, the most afflicted of all mothers!’ Mary raised her head, thanked them gratefully, and continued her sad journey.<br>
<sup>8</sup> When in the vicinity of Caiphas’s house, their grief was renewed by the sight of a group of men who were busily occupied under a tent, making the cross ready for our Lord’s crucifixion.<br>
<sup>9</sup> The enemies of Jesus had given orders that the cross should be prepared directly after his arrest, that they might without delay execute the sentence which they hoped to persuade Pilate to pass on him.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The Romans had already prepared the crosses of the two thieves, and the workmen who were making that of Jesus were much annoyed at being obliged to labour at it during the night; they did not attempt to conceal their anger at this, and uttered the most frightful oaths and curses, which pierced the heart of the tender Mother of Jesus through and through; but she prayed for these blind creatures who thus unknowingly blasphemed the Saviour who was about to die for their salvation, and prepared the cross for his cruel execution.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Mary, John, and the holy women traversed the outer court attached to Caiphas’s house.<br>
<sup>12</sup> They stopped under the archway of a door which opened into the inner court.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Mary’s heart was with her Divine Son, and she desired most ardently to see this door opened, that she might again have a chance of beholding him, for she knew that it alone separated her from the prison where he was confined.<br>
<sup>14</sup> The door was at length opened, and Peter rushed out, his face covered with his mantle, wringing his hands, and weeping bitterly.<br>
<sup>15</sup> By the light of torches he soon recognised John and the Blessed Virgin, but the sight of them only renewed those dreadful feelings of remorse which the look of Jesus had awakened in his breast.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Mary approached him instantly, and said, ‘Simon, tell me, I entreat you, what is become of Jesus, my Son?’ These words pierced his very heart; he could not even look at her, but turned away, and again wrung his hands.<br>
<sup>17</sup> Mary drew close to him, and said in a voice trembling with emotion: ‘Simon, son of John, why dost thou not answer me?’—Mother!’ exclaimed Peter, in a dejected tone, ‘O, Mother, speak not to me—thy Son is suffering more than words can express: speak not to me! They have condemned him to death, and I have denied him three times.<br>
<sup>18</sup> John came up to ask a few more questions, but Peter ran out of the court as if beside himself, and did not stop for a single moment until he reached the cave at Mount Olivet—that cave on the stones of which the impression of the hands of our Saviour had been miraculously left.<br>
<sup>19</sup> I believe it is the cave in which Adam took refuge to weep after his fall.<br>
<sup>20</sup> The Blessed Virgin was inexpressibly grieved at hearing of the fresh pang inflicted on the loving heart of her Divine Son, the pang of hearing himself denied by that disciple who had first acknowledged him as the Son of the Living God; she was unable to support herself, and fell down on the door-stone, upon which the impression of her feet and hands remains to the present day.<br>
<sup>21</sup> I have seen the stones, which are preserved somewhere, but I cannot at this moment remember where.<br>
<sup>22</sup> The door was not again shut, for the crowd was dispersing, and when the Blessed Virgin came to herself, she begged to be taken to some place as near as possible to her Divine Son.<br>
<sup>23</sup> John, therefore, led her and the holy women to the front of the prison where Jesus was confined.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Mary was with Jesus in spirit, and Jesus was with her; but this loving Mother wished to hear with her own ear the voice of her Divine Son.<br>
<sup>25</sup> She listened and heard not only his moans, but also the abusive language of those around him.<br>
<sup>26</sup> It was impossible for the holy women to remain in the court any longer without attracting attention.<br>
<sup>27</sup> The grief of Magdalen was so violent that she was unable to conceal it; and although the Blessed Virgin, by a special grace from Almighty God, maintained a calm and dignified exterior in the midst of her sufferings, yet even she was recognised, and overheard harsh words, such as these: ‘Is not that the Mother of the Galilean? Her Son will most certainly be executed, but not before the festival, unless, indeed, he is the greatest of criminals.<br>
<sup>28</sup> The Blessed Virgin left the court, and went up to the fireplace in the vestibule, where a certain number of persons were still standing.<br>
<sup>29</sup> When she reached the spot where Jesus had said that he was the Son of God, and the wicked Jews cried out, ‘He is guilty of death,’ she again fainted, and John and the holy women carried her away, in appearance more like a corpse than a living person.<br>
<sup>30</sup> The bystanders said not a word; they seemed struck with astonishment, and silence, such as might have been produced in hell by the passage of a celestial being, reigned in that vestibule.<br>
<sup>31</sup> The holy women again passed the place where the cross was being prepared; the workmen appeared to find as much difficulty in completing it as the judges had found in pronouncing sentence, and were obliged to fetch fresh wood every moment, for some bits would not fit, and others split; this continued until the different species of wood were placed in the cross according to the intentions of Divine Providence.<br>
<sup>32</sup> I saw angels who obliged these men to recommence their work, and who would not let them rest, until all was accomplished in a proper manner; but my remembrance of this vision is indistinct.
</p><br>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus confined in the subterranean Prison.</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> The Jews, having quite exhausted their barbarity, shut Jesus up in a little vaulted prison, the remains of which subsist to this day.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Two of the archers alone remained with him, and they were soon replaced by two others.<br>
<sup>3</sup> He was still clothed in the old dirty mantle, and covered with the spittle and other filth which they had thrown over him; for they had not allowed him to put on his own clothes again, but kept his hands tightly bound together.<br>
<sup>4</sup> When our Lord entered this prison, he prayed most fervently that his Heavenly Father would accept all that he had already suffered, and all that he was about to suffer, as an expiatory sacrifice, not only for his executioners, but likewise for all who in future ages might have to suffer torments such as he was about to endure, and be tempted to impatience or anger.<br>
<sup>5</sup> The enemies of our Lord did not allow him a moment’s respite, even in this dreary prison, but tied him to a pillar which stood in the centre, and would not allow him to lean upon it, although he was so exhausted from ill treatment, the weight of his chains, and his numerous falls, that he could scarcely support himself on his swollen and torn feet.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Never for a moment did they cease insulting him; and when the first set were tired out, others replaced them.<br>
<sup>7</sup> It is quite impossible to describe all that the Holy of Holies suffered from these heartless beings; for the sight affected me so excessively that I became really ill, and I felt as if I could not survive it.<br>
<sup>8</sup> We ought, indeed, to be ashamed of that weakness and susceptibility which renders us unable to listen composedly to the descriptions, or speak without repugnance, of those sufferings which our Lord endured so calmly and patiently for our salvation.<br>
<sup>9</sup> The horror we feel is as great as that of a murderer who is forced to place his hands upon the wound he himself has inflicted on his victim.<br>
<sup>10</sup> Jesus endured all without opening his mouth; and it was man, sinful man, who perpetrated all these outrages against one who was at once their Brother, their Redeemer, and their God.<br>
<sup>11</sup> I, too, am a great sinner, and my sins cause these sufferings.<br>
<sup>12</sup> At the day of judgment, when the most hidden things will be manifested, we shall see the share we have had in the torments endured by the Son of God; we shall see how far we have caused them by the sins we so frequently commit, and which are, in fact, a species of consent which we give to, and a participation in, the tortures which were inflicted on Jesus by his cruel enemies.<br>
<sup>13</sup> If, alas! we reflected seriously on this, we should repeat with much greater fervour the words which we find so often in prayer books: ‘Lord, grant that I may die, rather than ever wilfully offend thee again by sin.<br>
<sup>14</sup> Jesus continued to pray for his enemies, and they being at last tired out left him in peace for a short time, when he leaned against the pillar to rest, and a bright light shone around him.<br>
<sup>15</sup> The day was beginning to dawn,—the day of his Passion, of our Redemption,—and a faint ray penetrating the narrow vent-hole of the prison, fell upon the holy and immaculate Lamb, who had taken upon himself the sins of the world.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Jesus turned towards the ray of light, raised his fettered hands, and, in the most touching manner, returned thanks to his Heavenly Father for the dawn of that day, which had been so long desired by the prophets, and for which he himself had so ardently sighed from the moment of his birth on earth, and concerning which he had said to his disciples, ‘I have a baptism wherewith I am to be baptised, and how am I straitened until it be accomplished!’ I prayed with him; but I cannot give the words of his prayer, for I was so completely overcome, and touched to hear him return thanks to his Father for the terrible sufferings which he had already endured for me, and for the still greater which he was about to endure.<br>
<sup>17</sup> I could only repeat over and over with the greatest fervour, ‘Lord, I beseech thee, give me these sufferings: they belong to me: I have deserved them in punishment for my sins.<br>
<sup>18</sup> I was quite overwhelmed with feelings of love and compassion when I looked upon him thus welcoming the first dawn of the great day of his Sacrifice, and that ray of light which penetrated into his prison might, indeed, be compared to the visit of a judge who wishes to be reconciled to a criminal before the sentence of death which he has pronounced upon him is executed.<br>
<sup>19</sup> The archers, who were dozing, woke up for a moment, and looked at him with surprise: they said nothing, but appeared to be somewhat astonished and frightened.<br>
<sup>20</sup> Our Divine Lord was confined in this prison an hour, or thereabouts.<br>
<sup>21</sup> Whilst Jesus was in this dungeon, Judas, who had been wandering up and down the valley of Hinnom like a madman, directed his step towards the house of Caiphas, with the thirty pieces of silver, the reward of his treachery, still hanging to his waist.<br>
<sup>22</sup> All was silent around, and he addressed himself to some of the sentinels, without letting them know who he was, and asked what was going to be done to the Galilean.<br>
<sup>23</sup> ‘He has been condemned to death, and he will certainly be crucified,’ was the reply.<br>
<sup>24</sup> Judas walked to and fro, and listened to the different conversations which were held concerning Jesus.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Some spoke of the cruel treatment he had received, other of his astonishing patience, while others, again discoursed concerning the solemn trial which was to take place in the morning before the great Council.<br>
<sup>26</sup> Whilst the traitor was listening eagerly to the different opinions given, day dawned; the members of the tribunal commenced their preparations, and Judas slunk behind the building that he might not be seen, for like Cain he sought to hide himself from human eyes, and despair was beginning to take possession of his soul.<br>
<sup>27</sup> The place in which he took refuge happened to be the very spot where the workmen had been preparing the wood for making the cross of our Lord; all was in readiness, and the men were asleep by its side.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Judas was filled with horror at the sight: he shuddered and fled when he beheld the instrument of that cruel death to which for a paltry sum of money he had delivered up his Lord and Master; he ran to and fro in perfect agonies of remorse, and finally hid himself in an adjoining cave, where he determined to await the trial which was to take place in the morning.
</p><br>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Morning Trial.</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> Caiphas, Annas, the ancients, and the scribes assembled in the morning in the great hall of the tribunal, to have a legal trial, as meetings at night were not lawful, and could only be looked upon in the light of preparatory audiences.<br>
<sup>2</sup> The majority of the members had slept in the house of Caiphas, where beds had been prepared for them, but some, and among them Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, had gone home, and returned at the dawn of day.<br>
<sup>3</sup> The meeting was crowded, and the members commenced their operations in the most hurried manner possible.<br>
<sup>4</sup> They wished to condemn Jesus to death at once, but Nicodemus, Joseph, and some others opposed their wishes and demanded that the decision should be deferred until after the festival, for fear of causing an insurrection among the people, maintaining likewise that no criminal could be justly condemned upon charges which were not proved, and that in the case now before them all the witnesses contradicted one another.<br>
<sup>5</sup> The High Priests and their adherents became very angry, and told Joseph and Nicodemus, in plain terms, that they were not surprised at their expressing displeasure at what had been done, because they were themselves partisans of the Galilean and his doctrines, and were fearful of being convicted.<br>
<sup>6</sup> The High Priest even went so far as to endeavour to exclude from the Council all those members who were in the lightest degree favourable to Jesus.<br>
<sup>7</sup> These members protested that they washed their hands of all the future proceedings of the Council, and leaving the room went to the Temple, and from this day never again took their seats in the Council.<br>
<sup>8</sup> Caiphas then ordered the guards to bring Jesus once more into his presence, and to prepare everything for taking him to Pilate’s court directly he should have pronounced sentence.<br>
<sup>9</sup> The emissaries of the Council hurried off to the prison, and with their usual brutality untied the hands of Jesus, dragged off the old mantle which they had thrown over his shoulders, made him put on his own soiled garment, and having fastened ropes round his waist, dragged him out of the prison.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The appearance of Jesus, when he passed through the midst of the crowd who were already assembled in the front of the house, was that of a victim led to be sacrificed; his countenance was totally changed and disfigured from ill-usage, and his garments stained and torn; but the sight of his sufferings, far from exciting a feeling of compassion in the hard hearted Jews, simply filled them with disgust, and increased their rage.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Pity was, indeed, a feeling unknown in their cruel breasts.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Caiphas, who did not make the slightest effort to conceal his hatred, addressed our Lord haughtily in these words: ‘If thou be Christ , tell us plainly.<br>
<sup>13</sup> Then Jesus raised his head, and answered with great dignity and calmness, ‘If I shall tell you, you will not believe me; and if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, or let me go.<br>
<sup>14</sup> But hereafter the Son of Man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.<br>
<sup>15</sup> The High Priests looked at one another, and said to Jesus, with a disdainful laugh, ‘Art thou, then, the Son of God?’ And Jesus answered, with the voice of eternal truth, ‘You say that I am.<br>
<sup>16</sup> At these words they all exclaimed, ‘What need we any further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.<br>
<sup>17</sup> They all arose instantly and vied with each other as to who should heap the most abusive epithets upon Jesus, whom they termed a low-born miscreant, who aspired to being their Messiah, and pretended to be entitled to sit at the right hand of God.<br>
<sup>18</sup> They ordered the archers to tie his hands again, and to fasten a chain round his neck (this was usually done to criminals condemned to death), and they then prepared to conduct him to Pilate’s hall, where a messenger had already been dispatched to beg him to have all in readiness for trying a criminal, as it was necessary to make no delay on account of the festival day.<br>
<sup>19</sup> The Jewish Priests murmured among themselves at being obliged to apply to the Roman governor for the confirmation of their sentence, but it was necessary, as they had not the right of condemning criminals excepting for things which concerned religion and the Temple alone, and they could not pass a sentence of death.<br>
<sup>20</sup> They wished to prove that Jesus was an enemy to the emperor, and this accusation concerned those departments which were under Pilate’s jurisdiction.<br>
<sup>21</sup> The soldiers were all standing in front of the house, surrounded by a large body of the enemies of Jesus, and of common persons attracted by curiosity.<br>
<sup>22</sup> The High Priests and a part of the Council walked at the head of the procession, and Jesus, led by archers, and guarded by soldiers, followed, while the mob brought up the rear.<br>
<sup>23</sup> They were obliged to descend Mount Sion, and cross a part of the lower town to reach Pilate’s palace, and many priests who had attended the Council went to the Temple directly afterwards, as it was necessary to prepare for the festival.
</p><br>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Despair of Judas</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> Whilst the Jews were conducting Jesus to Pilate, the traitor Judas walked about listening to the conversation of the crowd who followed, and his ears were struck by words such as these: ‘They are taking him before Pilate; the High Priests have condemned the Galilean to death; he will be crucified; they will accomplish his death; he has been already dreadfully illtreated; his patience is wonderful, he answers not; his only words are that he is the Messiah, and that he will be seated at the right hand of God; they will crucify him on account of those words; had he not said them they could not have condemned him to death.<br>
<sup>2</sup> The miscreant who sold him was one of his disciples; and had a short time before eaten the Paschal lamb with him; not for worlds would I have had to do with such an act; however guilty the Galilean may be, he has not at all events sold his friend for money; such an infamous character as this disciple is infinitely more deserving of death.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Then, but too late, anguish, despair, and remorse took possession of the mind of Judas.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Satan instantly prompted him to fly.<br>
<sup>5</sup> He fled as if a thousand furies were at his heel, and the bag which was hanging at his side struck him as he ran, and propelled him as a spur from hell; but he took it into his hand to prevent its blows.<br>
<sup>6</sup> He fled as fast as possible, but where did he fly? Not towards the crowd, that he might cast himself at the feet of Jesus, his merciful Saviour, implore his pardon, and beg do die with him,—not to confess his fault with true repentance before God, but to endeavour to unburden himself before the world of his crime, and of the price of his treachery.<br>
<sup>7</sup> He ran like one beside himself into the Temple, where several members of the Council had gathered together after the judgment of Jesus.<br>
<sup>8</sup> They looked at one another with astonishment; and then turned their haughty countenances, on which a smile of irony was visible, upon Judas.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He with a frantic gesture tore the thirty pieces of silver from his side, and holding them forth with his right hand, exclaimed in accents of the most deep despair, ‘Take back your silver—that silver with which you bribed me to betray this just man; take back your silver; release Jesus; our compact is at an end; I have sinned grievously, for I have betrayed innocent blood.<br>
<sup>10</sup> The priests answered him in the most contemptuous manner, and, as if fearful of contaminating themselves by the contact of the reward of the traitor, would not touch the silver he tended, but replied, ‘What have we to do with thy sin? If thou thinkest to have sold innocent blood, it is thine own affair; we know what we have paid for, and we have judged him worthy of death.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Thou hast thy money, say no more.<br>
<sup>12</sup> They addressed these words to him in the abrupt tone in which men usually speak when anxious to get rid of a troublesome person, and instantly arose and walked away.<br>
<sup>13</sup> These words filled Judas with such rage and despair that he became almost frantic: his hair stood on end on his head; he rent in two the bag which contained the thirty pieces of silver, cast them down in the Temple, and fled to the outskirts of the town.<br>
<sup>14</sup> I again beheld him rushing to and fro like a madman in the valley of Hinnom: Satan was by his side in a hideous form, whispering in his ear, to endeavour to drive him to despair, all the curses which the prophets had hurled upon this valley, where the Jews formerly sacrificed their children to idols.<br>
<sup>15</sup> It appeared as if all these maledictions were directed against him, as in these words, for instance: ‘They shall go forth, and behold the carcases of those who have sinned against me, whose worm dieth not, and whore fires shall never be extinguished.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Then the devil murmured in his ears, ‘Cain, where is thy brother Abel? What hast thou done?—his blood cries to me for vengeance: thou art cursed upon earth, a wanderer for ever.<br>
<sup>17</sup> When he reached the torrent of Cedron, and saw Mount Olivet, he shuddered, turned away, and again the words vibrated in his ear, ‘Friend, whereto art thou come? Judas, dost thou betray the Son of Man with a kiss?’ Horror filled his soul, his head began to wander, and the arch fiend again whispered, ‘It was here that David crossed the Cedron when he fled from Absalom.<br>
<sup>18</sup> Absalom put an end to his life by hanging himself.<br>
<sup>19</sup> It was of thee that David spoke when he said: “And they repaid me evil for good; hatred for my love.<br>
<sup>20</sup> May the devil stand at his right hand; when he is judged, may he go out condemned.<br>
<sup>21</sup> May his days be few, and his bishopric let another take.<br>
<sup>22</sup> May the iniquity of his father be remembered in the sight of the Lord, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out, because he remembered not to show mercy, but persecuted the poor man and the beggar and the broken in heart, to put him to death.<br>
<sup>23</sup> And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him.<br>
<sup>24</sup> And he put on cursing like a garment, and it went in like water into his entrails, and like oil into his bones.<br>
<sup>25</sup> May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like a girdle, with which he is girded continually.<br>
<sup>26</sup> Overcome by these terrible thoughts Judas rushed on, and reached the foot of the mountain.<br>
<sup>27</sup> It was a dreary, desolate spot filled with rubbish and putrid remains; discordant sounds from the city reverberated in his ears, and Satan continually repeated, ‘They are now about to put him to death; thou has sold him.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Knowest thou not the words of the law, “He who sells a soul among his brethren, and receives the price of it, let him die the death”? Put an end to thy misery, wretched one; put an end to thy misery.<br>
<sup>29</sup> Overcome by despair Judas tore off his girdle, and hung himself on a tree which grew in a crevice of the rock, and after death his body burst asunder, and his bowels were scattered around.
</p><br>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus is taken before Pilate.</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> The malicious enemies of our Saviour led him through the most public part of the town to take him before Pilate.<br>
<sup>2</sup> The procession wended its way slowly down the north side of the mountain of Sion, then passed through that section on the eastern side of the Temple, called Acre, towards the palace and tribunal of Pilate, which were seated on the north-west side of the Temple, facing a large square.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Caiphas, Annas, and many others of the Chief Council, walked first in festival attire; they were followed by a multitude of scribes and many other Jews, among whom were the false witnesses, and the wicked Pharisees who had taken the most prominent part in accusing Jesus.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Our Lord followed at a short distance; he was surrounded by a band of soldiers, and led by the archers.<br>
<sup>5</sup> The multitude thronged on all sides and followed the procession, thundering forth the most fearful oaths and imprecations, while groups of persons were hurrying to and fro, pushing and jostling one another.<br>
<sup>6</sup> Jesus was stripped of all save his under garment, which was stained and soiled by the filth which had been flung upon it; a long chain was hanging round his neck, which struck his knees as he walked; his hands were pinioned as on the previous day, and the archers dragged him by the ropes which were fastened round his waist.<br>
<sup>7</sup> He tottered rather than walked, and was almost unrecognisable from the effects of his sufferings during the night;—he was colourless, haggard, his face swollen and even bleeding, and his merciless persecutors continued to torment him each moment more and more.<br>
<sup>8</sup> They had gathered together a large body of the dregs of the people, in order to make his present disgraceful entrance into the city a parody on his triumphal entrance on Palm Sunday.<br>
<sup>9</sup> They mocked, and with derisive gestures called him king, and tossed in his path stones, bits of wood; and filthy rags; they made game of, and by a thousand taunting speeches mocked him, during this pretended triumphal entry.<br>
<sup>10</sup> In the corner of a building, not far from the house of Caiphas, the afflicted Mother of Jesus, with John and Magdalen, stood watching for him.<br>
<sup>11</sup> Her soul was ever united to his; but propelled by her love, she left no means untried which could enable her really to approach him.<br>
<sup>12</sup> She remained at the Cenacle for some time after her midnight visit to the tribunal of Caiphas, powerless and speechless from grief; but when Jesus was dragged forth from his prison, to be again brought before his judges, she arose, cast her veil and cloak about her, and said to Magdalen and John: ‘Let us follow my Son to Pilate’s court; I must again look upon him.<br>
<sup>13</sup> They went to a place through which the procession must pass, and waited for it.<br>
<sup>14</sup> The Mother of Jesus knew that her Son was suffering dreadfully, but never could she have conceived the deplorable, the heartrending condition to which he was reduced by the brutality of his enemies.<br>
<sup>15</sup> Her imagination had depicted him to her as suffering fearfully, but yet supported and illuminated by sanctity, love, and patience.<br>
<sup>16</sup> Now, however, the sad reality burst upon her.<br>
<sup>17</sup> First in the procession appeared the priests, those most bitter enemies of her Divine Son.<br>
<sup>18</sup> They were decked in flowing robes; but at, terrible to say, instead of appearing resplendent in their character of priests of the Most High, they were transformed into priests of Satan, for no one could look upon their wicked countenances without beholding there, portrayed in vivid colours, the evil passions with which their souls were filled—deceit, infernal cunning, and a raging anxiety to carry out that most tremendous of crimes, the death of their Lord and Saviour, the only Son of God.<br>
<sup>19</sup> Next followed the false witnesses, his perfidious accusers, surrounded by the vociferating populace; and last of all—himself—her Son—Jesus, the Son of God, the Son of Man, loaded with chains, scarcely able to support himself, but pitilessly dragged on by his infernal enemies, receiving blows from some, buffets from others, and from the whole assembled rabble curses, abuse, and the most scurrilous language.<br>
<sup>20</sup> He would have been perfectly unrecognisable even to her maternal eyes, stripped as he was of all save a torn remnant of his garment, had she not instantly marked the contrast between his behaviour and that of his vile tormentors.<br>
<sup>21</sup> He alone in the midst of persecution and suffering looked calm and resigned, and far from returning blow for blow, never raised his hands but in acts of supplication to his Eternal Father for the pardon of his enemies.<br>
<sup>22</sup> As he approached, she was unable to restrain herself any longer, but exclaimed in thrilling accents: ‘Alas! is that my Son? Ah, yes! I see that it is my beloved Son.<br>
<sup>23</sup> O, Jesus, my Jesus!’ When the procession was almost opposite, Jesus looked upon her with an expression of the greatest love and compassion; this look was too much for the heartbroken mother: she became for the moment totally unconscious, and John and Magdalen endeavoured to carry her home, but she quickly roused herself, and accompanied the beloved disciple to Pilate’s house.<br>
<sup>24</sup> The inhabitants of the town of Ophel were all gathered together in an open space to meet Jesus, but far from administering comfort, they added a fresh ingredient to his cup of sorrow; they inflicted upon him that sharp pang which must ever be felt by those who see their friends abandon them in the hour of adversity.<br>
<sup>25</sup> Jesus had done much for the inhabitants of Ophel, but no sooner did they see him reduced to such a state of misery and degradation, than their faith was shaken; they could no longer believe him to be a king, a prophet, the Messiah, and the Son of God.<br>
<sup>26</sup> The Pharisees jeered and made game of them, on account of the admiration they had formerly expressed for Jesus.<br>
<sup>27</sup> ‘Look at your king now,’ they exclaimed; ‘do homage to him; have you no congratulations to offer him now that he is about to be crowned , and seated on his throne? All his boasted miracles are at an end; the High Priest has put an end to his tricks and witchcraft.<br>
<sup>28</sup> Notwithstanding the remembrance which these poor people had of the miracles and wonderful cures which had been performed under their very eyes by Jesus; notwithstanding the great benefits he had bestowed upon them, their faith was shaken by beholding him thus derided and pointed out as an object of contempt by the High Priest and the members of the Sanhedrin, who were regarded in Jerusalem with the greatest veneration.<br>
<sup>29</sup> Some went away doubting, while others remained and endeavoured to join the rabble, but they were prevented by the guards, who had been sent by the Pharisees, to prevent riots and confusion.
