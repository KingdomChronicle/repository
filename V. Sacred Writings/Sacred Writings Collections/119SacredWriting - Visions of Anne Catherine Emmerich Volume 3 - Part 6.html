 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">Jesus Goes Toward Maspha to Visit A Relative of St. Joseph</p>
                               

  <p>
 <sup>1</sup> When Jesus and His disciples left the cave, they struck off in the direction of Bethlehem. <br>
 <sup>2</sup> On this side of Ephron they entered an inn that stood among houses built apart, and there, after washing their feet, took some refreshment. <br>
 <sup>3</sup> The people were good and somewhat inquisitive. <br>
 <sup>4</sup> Jesus instructed them on penance, the nearness of Redemption, and of what they must do to follow Him. <br>
 <sup>5</sup> They asked Him why His Mother took that long journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem, since she could have been so comfortably cared for at home. <br>
 <sup>6</sup> Jesus answered by telling them of the Promise and that He was to be born in poverty at Bethlehem among the shepherds, since like a shepherd He was to gather the flocks together. <br>
 <sup>7</sup> It was also for this same reason that now, after His Heavenly Father’s testimony of Him, He visited these shepherd regions first. <br>
 <sup>8</sup> From here Jesus turned His steps to the south side of Bethlehem about two hours distant, crossed a portion of the shepherd valley, and proceeded around the west side of the city, leaving Joseph’s paternal house to the right. <br>
 <sup>9</sup> Toward evening He entered the now little city of Maspha, some hours from Bethlehem. <br>
 <sup>10</sup> Maspha could be seen at a great distance, for on the highroads all around the city burned lights in iron lanterns. <br>
 <sup>11</sup> It was encompassed by walls and towers, and traversed by several streets. <br>
 <sup>12</sup> Maspha was long one of the principal places of devotion. <br>
 <sup>13</sup> Judas Maccabeus 1 had before battle held here a great prayer meeting in which he reminded Almighty God of all the outrageous decrees of the enemy, recalled to Him His own promises, and exposed the priestly garments before the assembled multitude. <br>
 <sup>14</sup> Then five angels appeared to him before the city and promised him victory. <br>
 <sup>15</sup> It was here also that Israel had assembled against the tribe of Benjamin, on account of an outrage and murder committed upon the wife of a travelling Levite. <br>
 <sup>16</sup> The infamous scene was enacted under a tree, which was afterward walled around, and no one went near it. <br>
 <sup>17</sup> In Maspha also Samuel had exercised his office of Judge; and here was found that Essenian cloister in which dwelt Manahem, who had foretold the scepter to Herod when the latter was only a boy. <br>
 <sup>18</sup> This cloister had been built by the Essenian Chariot, who lived about one hundred years before Christ. <br>
 <sup>19</sup> He was a married man from the country of Jericho. <br>
 <sup>20</sup> He had separated from his wife and both, he for men and she for women, had founded several communities of Essenians. <br>
 <sup>21</sup> He was a very holy man and died in a cloister founded by him not far from Bethlehem. <br>
 <sup>22</sup> He was the first to arise from his tomb at the death of Christ and appear to men. <br>
 <sup>23</sup> Maspha was full of inns, and the arrival of a stranger was soon noised about the city; consequently Jesus had scarcely entered the inn when He was surrounded by a crowd. <br>
 <sup>24</sup> He was conducted to the synagogue where He explained the Law. <br>
 <sup>25</sup> Some of His hearers were spies whose intentions were insincere. <br>
 <sup>26</sup> They sought to draw Him out, because they had heard of His promise to lead the heathens also into the Kingdom of God, and that He had spoken among the shepherds about the Three Kings. <br>
 <sup>27</sup> Jesus’ words on this occasion were very severe. <br>
 <sup>28</sup> He said that the days of the Promise were completed; and that all who would be born again in Baptism, would believe in Him whom the Father had sent, and would keep His commandments, should as well as His followers have a share in the Kingdom. <br>
 <sup>29</sup> But from the unbelieving Jews should the Promise be withdrawn and given over to the heathens. <br>
 <sup>30</sup> I cannot repeat Jesus’ words exactly, but they were to this effect: that He knew their intentions, that they were spies, that they might betake themselves to Jerusalem, and there tell all they had heard Him say. <br>
 <sup>31</sup> Jesus had alluded to Judas Maccabeus and the several important events that had here taken place. <br>
 <sup>32</sup> His hearers boasted the magnificence of the Temple and the superiority of the Jews over the heathens. <br>
 <sup>33</sup> But Jesus explained to them that the end for which the chosen people had been called and their Temple erected was now attained, since the One promised by God through the Prophets was now come to establish the Kingdom of His Heavenly Father, and to raise to Him a new Temple. <br>
 <sup>34</sup> After this instruction, Jesus left Maspha and went about an hour eastward. <br>
 <sup>35</sup> He reached first a row of houses, then came to a residence that stood alone and which belonged to one of Joseph’s family. <br>
 <sup>36</sup> Joseph’s father had married a widow with one son. <br>
 <sup>37</sup> This stepson had married and settled in this place, and his descendants now occupied the house alluded to. <br>
 <sup>38</sup> They had been baptized and had a family of children. <br>
 <sup>39</sup> They received Jesus cordially and with every mark of deference. <br>
 <sup>40</sup> Several of the neighbors assembled at the house. <br>
 <sup>41</sup> Jesus gave an instruction after which He partook of a repast with them. <br>
 <sup>42</sup> The meal over, He retired with two of the men, Aminadab and Manasses. <br>
 <sup>43</sup> They questioned Him as to whether He was acquainted with their circumstances and whether they should follow Him right away. <br>
 <sup>44</sup> Jesus replied no, that they should for the present be numbered among His secret disciples. <br>
 <sup>45</sup> Then they knelt before Him, and He blessed them. <br>
 <sup>46</sup> Prior to His death, they publicly joined the disciples. <br>
 <sup>47</sup> Jesus stayed here overnight. <br>
 <sup>48</sup> Jesus Visits an Inn at Which Mary Stopped on Her Journey to Bethlehem  <br>
 <sup>49</sup> From here Jesus and His disciples went on for a couple of hours till they came to a farmhouse which had been the last stopping place but one on Mary’s journey to Bethlehem. <br>
 <sup>50</sup> It may have been about four hours’ distance from the city. <br>
 <sup>51</sup> The men of the house came out to meet Jesus and, falling down before Him on the road, begged Him to enter. <br>
 <sup>52</sup> He was very cordially received. <br>
 <sup>53</sup> These people went almost daily to John’s instructions and were all familiar with the wonders connected with the Lord’s baptism. <br>
 <sup>54</sup> A warm bath was prepared for Jesus, also a repast, and a beautiful couch was made ready for Him that night. <br>
 <sup>55</sup> Jesus taught here. <br>
 <sup>56</sup> The woman who had harbored the Holy Family here thirty years ago was still alive. <br>
 <sup>57</sup> But she was blind, and had been for many years almost bent double. <br>
 <sup>58</sup> She lived alone in the main building and her children, who lived nearby, sent her her food. <br>
 <sup>59</sup> When Jesus had performed His ablutions, He went to see the poor, old woman. <br>
 <sup>60</sup> He spoke to her of compassion and hospitality, of good works that bear no merit, and of selfishness, placing her present afflictions before her as a punishment of the same. <br>
 <sup>61</sup> She was deeply touched, confessed her fault, and He cured her. <br>
 <sup>62</sup> He ordered her to bathe in the water He had just used. <br>
 <sup>63</sup> She did so, recovered her sight, and became straight and well. <br>
 <sup>64</sup> But Jesus commanded her to say nothing of her cure. <br>
 <sup>65</sup> The people of this place questioned Jesus as to which was the greater, He or John. <br>
 <sup>66</sup> Jesus answered: “He of whom John gives testimony. <br>
 <sup>67</sup> Then they spoke of John’s zeal and energy, also of the beautiful, manly figure of Jesus Himself. <br>
 <sup>68</sup> Jesus remarked that, three and a half years hence, they would see no beauty in Him, they would not even recognize Him so disfigured would He be. <br>
 <sup>69</sup> Of John’s zeal and energy He spoke, likening him to one knocking at the house of a sleeping man, to rouse him for the coming of the Lord; to one breaking a path through the wilderness, that the king might safely travel over it; and lastly to an impetuous torrent that rushing along purifies the channel through which it flows.

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">“Behold the Lamb of God”</p> 

<p>
<sup>1</sup> Next morning at daybreak Jesus departed with His disciples, followed by the crowd that had gathered around Him <br>.
<sup>2</sup> They wended their way toward the Jordan, distant from this point at least three hours <br>.
<sup>3</sup> The Jordan flows through a broad valley that rises on either bank for the distance of about half an hour <br>.
<sup>4</sup> The stone in the enclosed space whereon the Ark of the Covenant had rested, and where the recent festival was celebrated, was about an hour’s distance from John’s place of baptism, that is, taking it in a straight line toward Jerusalem <br>.
<sup>5</sup> John’s hut near the twelve stones was in direction of Beth-Araba and somewhat more to the south than the stone of the Ark of the Covenant <br>.
<sup>6</sup> The twelve stones lay one-half hour from the place of baptism and in the direction of Gilgal <br>.
<sup>7</sup> Gilgal was on a gentle slope on the west side of the mountain <br>.
<sup>8</sup> From John’s baptismal pool the view up both the shores, which were very fertile, was most lovely <br>.
<sup>9</sup> The most delightful region, however, rich in fruits and teeming with abundance, was around the Sea of Galilee <br>.
<sup>10</sup> But here, and also around Bethlehem, there were broader meadowlands, more husbandry, and a greater abundance of durra, garlic, and cucumbers <br>.
<sup>11</sup> Jesus had already passed the memorial stone of the Ark of the Covenant and was about one quarter of an hour beyond John’s tent, before which the latter stood teaching <br>.
<sup>12</sup> A gap in the valley disclosed this scene to the distant traveler, and Jesus in passing was for not longer than a couple of minutes visible to the Baptist <br>.
<sup>13</sup> John was seized by the Spirit and, pointing to Jesus, he cried out: “Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world!” Jesus passed, preceded and followed by His disciples in groups, the multitude lately gathered around Him in the rear <br>.
<sup>14</sup> It was early morning <br>.
<sup>15</sup> The people crowded forward at the words of John, but Jesus had already disappeared <br>.
<sup>16</sup> They called after Him in acclamations of praise, but He was out of hearing <br>.
<sup>17</sup> When returned from their fruitless attempt to see Jesus, the people complained to John that Jesus had so many followers and that, as they had heard, His disciples had already begun to baptize <br>.
<sup>18</sup> What, they asked, would be the outcome of all that <br>.
<sup>19</sup> John made answer by repeating that he would soon resign his place to Jesus, since he was only a servant and precursor <br>.
<sup>20</sup> These words were not at all acceptable to John’s followers, who were somewhat jealous of Jesus’ disciples <br>.
<sup>21</sup> Jesus now directed His steps toward the northwest, leaving Jericho on the right and proceeding to Gilgal about two hours distant from Jericho <br>.
<sup>22</sup> He stopped at many places on the way <br>.
<sup>23</sup> The children followed Him singing songs of praise, and ran into the houses to bring their parents out.
</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus in Gilgal, Dibon, Socoth, Aruma, and Bethania</p> 

<p>
<sup>1</sup> The region known as Gilgal comprised the whole of the elevated country above the low valley of the Jordan, and which was embraced by the inflowing streams of the Jordan for a circumference of five hours <br>.
<sup>2</sup> But the city Gilgal, to which Jesus drew near before evening, lay scattered and interspersed by numerous gardens for the distance of about one hour, in the direction of the place to which John had retired to preach and baptize <br>.
<sup>3</sup> Jesus first entered the precincts of a sacred spot open to Prophets and Doctors of the Law <br>.
<sup>4</sup> It was the place where Joshua had communicated something to the Children of Israel, namely, the six maledictions and six benedictions that had been revealed to Eliezer and himself by Moses before his death <br>.
<sup>5</sup> The circumcision hill of the Israelites was nearby, and it, too, was enclosed by a wall <br>.
<sup>6</sup> I saw on this occasion the death of Moses <br>.
<sup>7</sup> He died upon a low, but steep peak of Mount Nebo, which rises between Arabia and Moab <br>.
<sup>8</sup> The camp of the Israelites flanked the mount, the outposts extending far into the valley around <br>.
<sup>9</sup> A growth like ivy covered the whole mount <br>.
<sup>10</sup> It was short and crisp, and grew in tufts like the juniper <br>.
<sup>11</sup> Moses was obliged to support himself by it when climbing to the top of the peak <br>.
<sup>12</sup> Joshua and Eliezer were with him <br>.
<sup>13</sup> Moses had a vision from God that his companions saw not <br>.
<sup>14</sup> He delivered to Joshua a roll of writing containing six maledictions and six benedictions, which the latter had to publish to the people when in the Promised Land <br>.
<sup>15</sup> Then having embraced them, he commanded them to depart and not to look back <br>.
<sup>16</sup> When they had gone, Moses cast himself upon his knees with outstretched arms, and gently sank upon his side dead <br>.
<sup>17</sup> I saw the earth open under him and enclose him as in a beautiful grave <br>.
<sup>18</sup> When Moses appeared at the Transfiguration of Jesus on Thabor, I saw that he came from that place <br>.
<sup>19</sup> Joshua read the six blessings and six maledictions before the people <br>.
<sup>20</sup> Many of Jesus’ friends awaited Him in Gilgal: Lazarus, Joseph of Arimathea, Obed, a son of the widow of Nazareth, and others <br>.
<sup>21</sup> There was an inn here, in which they set refreshments before the Lord and His companions after washing their feet <br>.
<sup>22</sup> Before the crowds here assembled, many of whom were on their way to John’s baptism, Jesus gave an instruction <br>.
<sup>23</sup> The spot chosen for the purpose was near the baths and place of purification built high up on the sloping, terraced shore of an arm of the Jordan <br>.
<sup>24</sup> It was shaded by an awning, and all around were pleasure gardens ornamented with trees, shrubs, and green plots <br>.
<sup>25</sup> Saturnin and two other disciples who had left John to follow Jesus baptized after Jesus had given an instruction on the Holy Ghost <br>.
<sup>26</sup> He taught of the several attributes of the Holy Spirit, and pointed out the marks that distinguish one that has received Him <br>.
<sup>27</sup> John’s baptism was preceded by only a summary confession of sins accompanied by proofs of contrition and a promise of amendment <br>.
<sup>28</sup> But at the baptism of Jesus the acknowledgment of sin was not made in this general way <br>.
<sup>29</sup> Everyone accused himself individually and mentioned his chief transgressions <br>.
<sup>30</sup> Jesus exhorted to sincerity <br>.
<sup>31</sup> He frequently proclaimed the sins of those that, through pride or false shame, concealed them thus to lead them to repentance <br>.
<sup>32</sup> Here also Jesus alluded to the passage over the Jordan and the ceremony of circumcision that had here been performed <br>.
<sup>33</sup> It was in memory of this latter circumstance that baptism was now administered here and, through its efficacy, He said, they should henceforth be circumcised in their heart <br>.
<sup>34</sup> He spoke likewise of the fulfillment of the Law <br>.
<sup>35</sup> The baptized on this occasion were not immersed in the water, they only inclined their head over it; nor did they put on an entire baptismal garment, a white cloth only was placed on their shoulders <br>.
<sup>36</sup> The disciples did not make use of a three-channeled shell like John’s; but from the basin over which the neophyte inclined, they dipped up the water three times with the hand <br>.
<sup>37</sup> Jesus had previously blessed it and poured into it some from His own baptismal well <br>.
<sup>38</sup> About thirty were baptized at this time <br>.
<sup>39</sup> They appeared radiant with joy after the ceremony, and declared that they truly felt that they had now received the Holy Ghost <br>.
<sup>40</sup> Jesus then proceeded with His followers amid the acclamations of the multitude to Gilgal, to celebrate the Sabbath in the synagogue, a very large, old building on the east side of the city <br>.
<sup>41</sup> It was a four-cornered edifice, longer than broad, the angles filled in in such a way as to give it something of the appearance of an octagon <br>.
<sup>42</sup> It contained three stories, in each of which was a school <br>.
<sup>43</sup> A spiral, exterior flight of steps joined to the wall led up to each, and around each landing ran a little portico <br>.
<sup>44</sup> High up in the rounded corners of the building were niches, in which one could stand and view the country far and near <br>.
<sup>45</sup> The synagogue stood by itself with gardens cut off on both sides <br>.
<sup>46</sup> In front of the entrance was a porch and a teacher’s desk similar to that of the Temple in Jerusalem, and there was also an open court containing an altar upon which sacrifice had once been offered <br>.
<sup>47</sup> There were likewise covered porches for women and children <br>.
<sup>48</sup> One could easily detect the similarity of all these arrangements with those of the Temple, also that the Ark of the Covenant had once rested here and sacrifices had been offered <br>.
<sup>49</sup> The school on the lowest story was the most beautiful in its arrangements <br>.
<sup>50</sup> At one end, in the spot corresponding to that occupied by the Holy of Holies in the Temple, stood an octagonal pillar around which were compartments containing rolls of writings <br>.
<sup>51</sup> A table encircled the base of the pillar, and below that was a vault <br>.
<sup>52</sup> Here it was that the Ark of the Covenant had once stood <br>.
<sup>53</sup> The pillar was very beautiful, of polished white marble <br>.
<sup>54</sup> In the school on the first story, Jesus taught before the priests, the people, and the Doctors of the Law <br>.
<sup>55</sup> Among other things He alluded to the fact that here the promised kingdom had been first established, but that idolatry so abominable had been practiced at a later period that scarcely could seven just souls be found among the inhabitants <br>.
<sup>56</sup> Ninive, though five times greater, had been able to produce five just <br>.
<sup>57</sup> Gilgal had been spared by God, therefore they should not now repulse Him who came to fulfill the Promise: they should do penance and through Baptism be born anew <br>.
<sup>58</sup> Then taking the rolls from their places around the pillar, Jesus read and explained them <br>.
<sup>59</sup> After that He taught the young men in the school on the second story, and lastly the boys on the third <br>.
<sup>60</sup> Coming down, He delivered another instruction to the women in an open space under a porch, and still another to the young maidens <br>.
<sup>61</sup> To these last He spoke of modesty and chastity, of repressing curiosity, of modesty in dress, of veiling the hair, and of covering the head in the Temple and in the synagogue <br>.
<sup>62</sup> He reminded them of the presence of God and the angels in holy places, and that the latter themselves veil their face before the Lord <br>.
<sup>63</sup> He told them that in the Temple and synagogue there were myriads of angels hovering around the worshippers, and He ex-plained why females should veil the head and hair <br>.
<sup>64</sup> The children ran familiarly to Jesus <br>.
<sup>65</sup> He blessed them and took them up in His arms <br>.
<sup>66</sup> They were very much attached to Him <br>.
<sup>67</sup> The joy and jubilation over Jesus were general in this place <br>.
<sup>68</sup> As He left the school, the people ran from all sides to meet Him, crying out, and exclaiming: “The Promise is fulfilled! May it remain with us <br>.
<sup>69</sup> May it never forsake us! <br>”
<sup>70</sup> When Jesus had finished His instructions, the people were anxious to bring their sick to Him <br>.
<sup>71</sup> But He dismissed them, saying that it was neither the time nor the place for that, He must now leave them, for He was called elsewhere <br>.
<sup>72</sup> Lazarus and the friends from Jerusalem returned to their homes and Jesus took leave of the Blessed Virgin, telling her that He would see her again before He retired into the desert <br>.
<sup>73</sup> The Sanhedrin in Jerusalem again held a long consultation on the subject of Jesus <br>.
<sup>74</sup> Everywhere they had spies bribed to give them information of His words and actions <br>.
<sup>75</sup> The Sanhedrin consisted of seventy-one priests and doctors, of whom twenty were again divided into fives, thus forming so many subcommittees for deliberating and disputing together <br>.
<sup>76</sup> They examined the genealogical register, and could in no way deny that Joseph and Mary were of the House of David and Mary’s mother of the race of Aaron <br>.
<sup>77</sup> But as they said, these families had fallen into obscurity, and Jesus strolled around with vagrants <br>.
<sup>78</sup> He also defiled Himself with publicans and heathens, and sought the favor of slaves <br>.
<sup>79</sup> They had heard, they said, of the familiar way in which He had spoken lately to the Sichemites, who were returning home from their work in the region of Bethlehem, and they thought that He must have designs to raise an insurrection with the aid of such hangers-on <br>.
<sup>80</sup> Some gave it as their opinion that He was very likely an illegitimate child, because He had once proclaimed Himself the son of a king <br>.
<sup>81</sup> Others declared that He must in some way receive secret training from the devil, for He often retired apart and spent the night alone in the wilderness or on the mountains <br>.
<sup>82</sup> They knew what they were saying, for they had already inquired into all this <br>.
<sup>83</sup> Among these twenty deliberators were some who knew Jesus and His family very well, who were most favorably inclined toward Him, who were indeed His friends in secret <br>.
<sup>84</sup> Nevertheless, they did not contradict what was said against Him <br>.
<sup>85</sup> They kept silence in order to be the better able to serve Him and His disciples and to give them information of whatever might come to their knowledge <br>.
<sup>86</sup> The majority of the committee concluded at last that Jesus was in communication with the devil from whom He received instruction, and this was the opinion they publicly proclaimed and which was spread throughout Jerusalem <br>.
<sup>87</sup> John’s disciples announced to him the baptism that had lately taken place in Gilgal, representing the same as a usurpation of his rights <br>.
<sup>88</sup> But in deepest humility John again repeated what he had often told them before; viz <br>.
<sup>89</sup>  that he would soon give place to his Lord, whose herald and precursor he had been <br>.
<sup>90</sup> The disciples could not rightly understand his words <br>.
<sup>91</sup> With about twenty followers, Jesus left Gilgal and moved on to the Jordan which He crossed on a raft <br>.
<sup>92</sup> All around on the beams of the raft were seats, and in the center two concave spaces in which they were accustomed to stand the camels that they might not slip between the beams into the water <br>.
<sup>93</sup> Three camels could be so accommodated; but now there were none on board, the Lord and His disciples being the only passengers <br>.
<sup>94</sup> It was night, and lighted torches stood in the hollow spaces <br>.
<sup>95</sup> Jesus related the parable of the sower which, on the following day, He explained <br>.
<sup>96</sup> The passage over the river occupied fifteen minutes at least, for the current at this point was very strong <br>.
<sup>97</sup> They had to row some distance up the river, and then drift down to the spot at which they intended to land, and which was not directly opposite their starting point <br>.
<sup>98</sup> The Jordan is a singular river; it cannot be crossed at all in many places, and its steep shores are pathless <br>.
<sup>99</sup> It makes frequent and sudden bends, and often appears to flow straight past a place around which it is, in reality, running <br>.
<sup>100</sup> Its bed in many places is rocky and its course consequently arrested <br>.
<sup>101</sup> Its waters encircle numerous islands as they flow sometimes troubled, sometimes clear, according to the nature of its bed, here and there forming falls <br>.
<sup>102</sup> The water of the Jordan is soft and tepid <br>.
<sup>103</sup> They landed near the settlement of the publicans <br>.
<sup>104</sup> A highroad from the region of Kedar passed nearby and there, too, a lovely valley took its rise <br>.
<sup>105</sup> The publicans, who had already received John’s baptism, entertained Jesus; but several of His followers, surprised at their Master’s intimacy with these despised people, stood shyly aloof <br>.
<sup>106</sup> Jesus and His disciples spent the night here, accepting hospitality from the publicans, who were most deferential to them <br>.
<sup>107</sup> Their houses stood on the side of the road that ran through the valley and not far from the Jordan; somewhat further on was the inn for the accommodation of merchants and their camels <br>.
<sup>108</sup> There were many tarrying here at the time, on account of the next day’s feast, that of Tabernacles; for although most of them were pagans, yet they were obliged to observe the festivals as days of rest <br>.
<sup>109</sup> The publicans questioned Jesus as to how they should restore their unjustly acquired goods <br>.
<sup>110</sup> He told them that they should be taken to the Temple, which however He meant only spiritually, for in reality He designated thereby His own community, the Church <br>.
<sup>111</sup> There should, He said, be purchased with it a field near Jerusalem for the support of poor widows, and He explained to them why a field, illustrating by the parable of the sower <br>.
<sup>112</sup> Next day Jesus walked with them on the shore and in the country around, teaching again of the sower and the future harvest <br>.
<sup>113</sup> He took His text from the feast of Tabernacles, which was then beginning, and which commemorated the vintage as well as the ingathering of the fruits of the field <br>.
<sup>114</sup> From the publican village, Jesus pressed on further through the valley <br>.
<sup>115</sup> On either side of the mountain slope, for the distance of half an hour perhaps, were rows of houses in which the Feast of Tabernacles was being celebrated <br>.
<sup>116</sup> These houses extended as far as Dibon in the environs of which indeed they appeared to be <br>.
<sup>117</sup> By their side were erected the booths formed of green branches of trees and adorned with bushes, festoons, and clusters of grapes <br>.
<sup>118</sup> On one side of the road were the tabernacles and the little tents of the women; on the other, the huts in which the animals were slaughtered <br>.
<sup>119</sup> All the food was carried across the road <br>.
<sup>120</sup> The children, adorned with garlands, went in bands from one tabernacle to another, singing and playing upon musical instruments <br>.
<sup>121</sup> These last consisted of triangles furnished with rings which they tinkled, triangles spanned by cords, and a wind instrument from which arose spiral tubes <br>.
<sup>122</sup> Jesus paused here and there to teach <br>.
<sup>123</sup> Refreshments were offered to Him and His disciples, grapes on sticks, two clusters on each <br>.
<sup>124</sup> At the further end of this row of houses stood an inn which Jesus entered <br>.
<sup>125</sup> Not far from the inn, between it and Dibon, was a broad, open space in the middle of the road <br>.
<sup>126</sup> Here, surrounded by trees, arose the large and beautiful synagogue of Dibon <br>.
<sup>127</sup> On the next day Jesus taught in the synagogue, taking again the parable of the sower, alluding to the baptism and the nearness of the Kingdom of God <br>.
<sup>128</sup> He spoke also of the feast of Tabernacles and of its celebration here, taking occasion to reprove the people for mixing up heathenish customs in their services, for some of the Moabites still dwelt in this place, and with them the Jewish people had intimate relations <br>.
<sup>129</sup> When Jesus left the synagogue, He found in the open court numbers of sick who had been borne thither on litters <br>.
<sup>130</sup> They cried out as soon as they saw Him: “Lord, Thou hast been sent from God! Thou canst help us! Help us, Lord!” He cured many <br>.
<sup>131</sup> That evening a banquet was prepared in the inn for Jesus and His followers <br>.
<sup>132</sup> There were many of the heathen merchants near Jesus when He spoke of the call of the Gentiles, of the star that had appeared in the Land of the Kings, and of their going to visit the Child <br>.
<sup>133</sup> Jesus left the place that night alone and went to pray on the mountain <br>.
<sup>134</sup> He had engaged to meet His disciples the following morning on the road at the other side of Dibon <br>.
<sup>135</sup> Dibon was six hours distant from Gilgal <br>.
<sup>136</sup> It was rich in fountains and meadows, gardens and terraces, for it lay in the valley and up both sides of the mountain <br>.
<sup>137</sup> Jesus next went to Socoth where He arrived toward evening <br>.
<sup>138</sup> An innumerable multitude gathered around Him, among them many sick <br>.
<sup>139</sup> He taught in the synagogue, and allowed Saturnin and four other disciples to administer baptism <br>.
<sup>140</sup> It took place at a spring in a rocky grotto facing westward toward the Jordan which, however, could not be seen from it as a hill intervened <br>.
<sup>141</sup> But the spring was fed from the deep waters of the river <br>.
<sup>142</sup> The light fell into the grotto from apertures in the roof <br>.
<sup>143</sup> In front of it was an extensive pleasure garden beautifully laid out with small trees, aromatic shrubs, and well-kept lawns <br>.
<sup>144</sup> In it was an ancient memorial stone commemorative of an apparition of Melchisedech to Abraham <br>.
<sup>145</sup> Jesus taught here of John’s baptism, which He called a baptism of penance, and which would soon be discontinued <br>.
<sup>146</sup> In its stead would be received the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and the remission of sin <br>.
<sup>147</sup> He received from them a kind of general confession of their sins, and then some separately disclosed their predominant passions and transgressions <br>.
<sup>148</sup> Many trembled at hearing Jesus accusing them of sins that they thought secret <br>.
<sup>149</sup> After the confession Jesus laid His hands upon them as if giving absolution <br>.
<sup>150</sup> They were not immersed when receiving baptism <br>.
<sup>151</sup> A large basin of water was placed on Abraham’s memorial stone, and over it the neophytes bowed with bared shoulders <br>.
<sup>152</sup> The baptizers poured the water thrice from the hollow of their hand over the heads of the baptized, who were very numerous at this place <br>.
<sup>153</sup> Abraham had once dwelt at Socoth with his nurse Maraha, and had owned fields in three different localities <br>.
<sup>154</sup> Even here he had begun to share with Lot <br>.
<sup>155</sup> It was here that Melchisedech first appeared to Abraham in the same way as did the angels <br>.
<sup>156</sup> Melchisedech commanded him a threefold sacrifice of doves, long beaked birds, and other animals, promising to come again and offer bread and wine in sacrifice <br>.
<sup>157</sup> He told him what was going to happen to Sodom and to Lot, and pointed out to him several graces for which he should pray <br>.
<sup>158</sup> Melchisedech at that time had no longer an earthly abode at Salem <br>.
<sup>159</sup> Jacob also dwelt at Socoth <br>.
<sup>160</sup> From Socoth Jesus proceeded to Great Chorazin where, at an inn near the city, He had appointed to meet His Mother and the holy women <br>.
<sup>161</sup> On the way thither He passed through Gersas where He kept the Sabbath, after which He went to an inn in the desert some hours from the Sea of Galilee <br>.
<sup>162</sup> The proprietors dwelt nearby <br>.
<sup>163</sup> The inn was still adorned as for the feast of Tabernacles, for the holy women had rented it some days previously and put all things in order <br>.
<sup>164</sup> The necessary provisions were brought at their expense from Gerasa <br>.
<sup>165</sup> Peter’s wife was with them, also Susanna of Jerusalem, and all the others excepting Veronica <br>.
<sup>166</sup> Jesus had an interview with His Mother alone <br>.
<sup>167</sup> He told her that He was now on His way to Bethania, whence He would retire to the desert <br>.
<sup>168</sup> Mary was grave and anxious <br>.
<sup>169</sup> She begged Him not to go to Jerusalem for awhile, for she had heard of the council convened on His account <br>.
<sup>170</sup> Later on Jesus gave an instruction <br>.
<sup>171</sup> The place chosen for it was a hill upon which was a stone seat formerly used for the same purpose <br>.
<sup>172</sup> There were rows of people from the surrounding country and about thirty women present <br>.
<sup>173</sup> They stood apart from the men <br>.
<sup>174</sup> After the instruction Jesus told His followers that He must now leave them for a time and that they, as well as the women, should disband until His return <br>.
<sup>175</sup> He spoke of John’s baptism soon to cease, and of the bitter persecution awaiting Him and His <br>.
<sup>176</sup> Jesus left the inn with about twenty disciples and followers, and journeyed some twelve hours southwest toward the city of Aruma near which an inn for Him and His friends was always in readiness <br>.
<sup>177</sup> Martha, for whom the journey to Gerasa was her first expedition with the holy women, had prepared this inn for Jesus, and His friends in Jerusalem bore the cost <br>.
<sup>178</sup> The steward and servants lived in the neighborhood <br>.
<sup>179</sup> The holy women told Jesus of the inn before His departure <br>.
<sup>180</sup> The city was about nine hours from Jerusalem and between six and seven from Jericho <br>.
<sup>181</sup> Some Essenians dwelt near the inn <br>.
<sup>182</sup> They went to see Jesus, conversed and ate with Him <br>.
<sup>183</sup> Jesus went to the synagogue and taught of John’s baptism, which was a baptism of penance, a preliminary purification, a preparatory action such as was prescribed in the Law <br>.
<sup>184</sup> It was different from the Baptism of Him whom John heralded <br>.
<sup>185</sup> They that were baptized by John I did not see again baptized, until after the death of Jesus and the coming of the Holy Ghost when, for the most part, the ceremony was performed at the pool of Bethsaida <br>.
<sup>186</sup> The Pharisees of this place asked Jesus by what signs they should know the Messiah, and He told them <br>.
<sup>187</sup> He gave an instruction on the subject of mixed marriages with the heathens and Samaritans <br>.
<sup>188</sup> Judas Iscariot, subsequently the Apostle, here heard Jesus preaching <br>.
<sup>189</sup> He had come alone and not with the other disciples <br>.
<sup>190</sup> After listening to His instructions for two days, and passing remarks on the same with the disaffected Pharisees, he departed for a neighboring village which did not bear a very good name <br>.
<sup>191</sup> There he gave an account of what he had heard, talking with an air of importance to a pious man of the place <br>.
<sup>192</sup> The latter in consequence invited Jesus to visit him <br>.
<sup>193</sup> Judas carried on some kind of traffic <br>.
<sup>194</sup> He was much occupied with writing, and held himself in readiness for general services of any kind <br>.
<sup>195</sup> When Jesus and His disciples arrived at the aforenamed place, which had been lately built and which on account of its mixed population was not in very good repute, Judas had departed <br>.
<sup>196</sup> Herod owned a castle in the neighborhood <br>.
<sup>197</sup> Something connected with the Benjaminites must have happened in this place, for there was a tree close at hand surrounded by a wall, and no one went near it <br>.
<sup>198</sup> Abraham and Jacob had each offered sacrifice here, and hither had Esau withdrawn when at variance with Jacob on the subject of the Blessing <br>.
<sup>199</sup> Isaac at that time was living near Sichar <br>.
<sup>200</sup> The man that had invited Jesus to these parts was called Jairus; he belonged to the married Essenians <br>.
<sup>201</sup> He had a wife and several children, among the latter two sons named Ammon and Caleb <br>.
<sup>202</sup> He had also a daughter whom Jesus at a later period cured of some disease, but he was not the Jairus of the Gospel <br>.
<sup>203</sup> He was a descendant of Chariot the Essenian, who had founded the convents near Bethlehem and Maspha, and he was familiar with many circumstances of Jesus’ youth and family <br>.
<sup>204</sup> He and his sons went forth to meet Jesus, whom they received with marks of deference <br>.
<sup>205</sup> Jairus was, on account of his charity, the chief man of this despised place <br>.
<sup>206</sup> He helped the poor and, on certain days, gave instructions to the children and the ignorant, for they had here neither schools nor priests <br>.
<sup>207</sup> He likewise cared for the sick <br>.
<sup>208</sup> As usual, Jesus taught of the baptism of John, setting it forth as a preparatory baptism of penance, also of the near coming of the Kingdom of God <br>.
<sup>209</sup> With Jairus He visited the sick, and consoled them, but He would not cure any <br>.
<sup>210</sup> He promised to return in four months and cure them <br>.
<sup>211</sup> In His instructions He alluded to the events that had taken place here, namely, the estrangement of Esau in anger from his brother, and the consequences following upon his rage <br>.
<sup>212</sup> It was this that had brought the place into ill-repute <br>.
<sup>213</sup> Jesus told of the mercy of the Heavenly Father, who would realize all His promises in favor of those that would believe in the One sent by Him, would do penance, and be baptized and He showed how penance wards off the consequences of sin <br>.
<sup>214</sup> Toward evening, accompanied about halfway by Jairus and his sons, Jesus went with His disciples to Bethania <br>.
<sup>215</sup> They stopped at an inn in the vicinity, and there Jesus gave His disciples a long instruction in which He alluded to the trials in store for Him and all His followers <br>.
<sup>216</sup> He told them that they should now leave Him, and weigh well whether they would be able to stand by Him in His future sufferings <br>.
<sup>217</sup> Lazarus came out to meet Him <br>.
<sup>218</sup> The disciples departed for their homes, Aram and Themeni alone accompanying Him to Bethania where many friends from Jerusalem were awaiting Him, among them the holy women and Veronica <br>.
<sup>219</sup> Aram and Themeni were the nephews of Joseph of Arimathea on the mother’s side <br>.
<sup>220</sup> They had been John’s disciples, but had followed Jesus when on His way to Gilgal He had passed John’s place of baptism <br>.
<sup>221</sup> Jesus gave an instruction at Lazarus’ on the baptism of John, on the Messiah, on the Law and its fulfillment, and on the various sects among the Jews <br>.
<sup>222</sup> His friends had brought with them from Jerusalem some rolls of writings from which Jesus explained to them the words of the Prophets relative to the Messiah <br>.
<sup>223</sup> But only a few were present at this instruction, only Lazarus and some intimate friends <br>.
<sup>224</sup> Jesus advised with them on the subject of His future abode <br>.
<sup>225</sup> They counseled Him not to remain in Jerusalem, telling Him all that was said of Him there <br>.
<sup>226</sup> They proposed to Him Salem as proper for His residence, since but few Pharisees were in it <br>.
<sup>227</sup> Jesus spoke of various places and of Melchisedech, whose figurative priesthood was soon to be realized <br>.
<sup>228</sup> Melchisedech had laid out all the roads, founded all the places that in the designs of God the Son of Man was afterward to travel over and evangelize <br>.
<sup>229</sup> Jesus concluded by telling them that He would be found mostly around the Lake of Genesareth <br>.
<sup>230</sup> This conference was held in a retired apartment that opened upon a garden attached to the baths <br>.
<sup>231</sup> Jesus had an interview with the women in a chamber fronting on the road that led to Jerusalem, and which had formerly been occupied by Magdalen <br>.
<sup>232</sup> In obedience to Jesus’ direction, Lazarus brought his silent sister Mary and left her alone with the Lord, the other women retiring in the meantime to the antechamber <br>.
<sup>233</sup> Silent Mary’s bearing toward Jesus was somewhat different from that of the last interview, for she cast herself down before Him and kissed His feet <br>.
<sup>234</sup> Jesus made no attempt to prevent her, and raised her up by the hand <br>.
<sup>235</sup> With her eyes turned heavenward, she, as once before, uttered the most sublime and wonderful things, though in the most simple and natural manner <br>.
<sup>236</sup> She spoke of God, of His Son, and of His Kingdom just as a peasant girl might talk of the father of the village lord and his inheritance <br>.
<sup>237</sup> Her words were a prophecy, and the things of which she spoke she saw before her <br>.
<sup>238</sup> She recounted the grave faults and bad management of the wicked servants of the household <br>.
<sup>239</sup> The Father had sent His Son to arrange affairs and payoff all debts, but they would receive Him badly <br>.
<sup>240</sup> He would have to die in great suffering, redeem His Kingdom with His own Blood, and efface the crimes of the servants, that they might again become the children of His Father <br>.
<sup>241</sup> She carried out the allegory in most beautiful language, and yet in as natural a manner as if she were recounting a scene enacted in her presence <br>.
<sup>242</sup> At times she was gay, at others sorrowful, calling herself a useless servant and grieving over the painful labors of the Son of the merciful Lord and Father <br>.
<sup>243</sup> Another cause of sorrow to her was that the servants would not rightly understand the parable, although so simple and so true <br>.
<sup>244</sup> She spoke of the Resurrection <br>.
<sup>245</sup> The Son, she said, would go to the servants in the subterranean prisons also <br>.
<sup>246</sup> He would console them and set them free, because He had purchased their Redemption <br>.
<sup>247</sup> He would return with them to His Father <br>.
<sup>248</sup> But at His second advent, when He would come again to judge, all those that had abused the satisfaction He had made and who would not turn from their evil ways, should be cast into the fire <br>.
<sup>249</sup> She then spoke of Lazarus’ death and resurrection: “He goes forth from this world,” she said, “and gazes upon the things of the other life <br>.
<sup>250</sup> His friends weep around him as if he were never to return <br>.
<sup>251</sup> But the Son calls him back to earth, and he labors in the vineyard <br>.
<sup>252</sup> Of Magdalen too she spoke: “The maiden is in the frightful desert where once were the children of Israel <br>.
<sup>253</sup> She wanders in accursed places where all is dark, where never human foot has trod <br>.
<sup>254</sup> But she will come forth, and in another desert make amends for the past <br>.
<sup>255</sup> Mary the Silent spoke of herself as of a captive, for her body appeared to her a prison, and she longed to go home <br>.
<sup>256</sup> She was so straitened on all sides; not one around her understood her and they were, as it seemed to her, all blind <br>.
<sup>257</sup> But, she said, she was willing to wait, she would bear her captivity submissively, for she deserved nothing better <br>.
<sup>258</sup> Jesus spoke to her lovingly, consoling her and saying: “After the Pasch, when I again come here, thou shalt indeed go home <br>.
<sup>259</sup> Then as she knelt before Him, He raised His hands over her and blessed her <br>.
<sup>260</sup> It seemed to me that at the same time He poured over her something from a flask, but I cannot say whether it was oil or water <br>.
<sup>261</sup> Mary the Silent was a very holy person, but none knew or understood her <br>.
<sup>262</sup> Her whole life was one uninterrupted vision of the work of Redemption, of which she spoke like an innocent child <br>.
<sup>263</sup> No one guessed her interior life, and she was regarded as a simpleton <br>.
<sup>264</sup> When Jesus signified to her the time of her death, viz., that she should, freed from captivity, at last go home, He anointed her for death <br>.
<sup>265</sup> From this we may conclude that anointing is more necessary for the body than some people generally think <br>.
<sup>266</sup> Jesus pitied Silent Mary who, as a reputed simpleton, would have received no embalming <br>.
<sup>267</sup> Her holiness was hidden <br>.
<sup>268</sup> Jesus dismissed her, and she returned to her abode <br>.
<sup>269</sup> After this Jesus again instructed the men on the baptism of John and that of the Holy Ghost <br>.
<sup>270</sup> I do not remember any very great difference between the first named and that bestowed by the disciples of Jesus <br>.
<sup>271</sup> The latter, however, was a little more like that which at a later period was to take away sin <br>.
<sup>272</sup> Nor did I ever see any of those that had been baptized by John rebaptized before the descent of the Holy Ghost <br>.
<sup>273</sup> The friends from Jerusalem returned to the city before the Sabbath, Aram and Themeni going in company with Joseph of Arimathea <br>.
<sup>274</sup> Jesus had told them that He would retire awhile in order to prepare for the painful mission before Him, that of teaching, but He did not tell them that He was going to fast.
