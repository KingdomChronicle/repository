        <p>(A story written by Melchizedek)</p>

        <p>Revelations that an angel of the Lord manifested to Melchizedek in a dream that took place the night after his coronation, a year after recovering the scepter of Salem, having paid the price of his rescue with pain and blood.</p>



 
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="chapterTitle">The Eternal lived an eternity before creating the Universe. World of Light. Mount Zion. River of life. Garden of Eden. Jerusalem, the city of peace. Lucifer, the firstborn of angels. Laws of divine government. Freedom of choose Angels, ministers of the kingdom of light Universe Abyss of darkness, test of faithfulness Separation between light and darkness.</p>


 <p>
    <sup>1</sup> Before there was a star to shine, before there were angels to sing, there was already a heaven, the home of the Eternal, the only God. Perfect in wisdom, love and glory, the Eternal lived an eternity, before realizing His beautiful dream, in the creation of the Universe. <br>
    <sup>2</sup> The countless beings that make up the creation were all idealized with love. From the tiny atom to the gigantic galaxies, everything deserved His supreme attention. Lover of music, God idealized the Universe as a great orchestra that, under His regency, should vibrate harmonious chords of justice and peace. For each creature He composed a love song. <br>
    <sup>3</sup> The Eternal was very happy, for His dreams were about to come true. Moving with majesty, he began His work of creation. His hands first shaped a world of light, and on him a glowing mountain on which the throne of the Universe would be forever affirmed. <br>
    <sup>4</sup> To the sacred mountain God called: Zion. From the base of the throne, the Eternal brought forth a crystalline river, to represent the life that would flow from Him to all creatures. As a throne room, he created a beautiful paradise that stretched for hundreds of kilometers around Mount Zion. To paradise he called: Eden. To the south of paradise, on both banks of the river of life, numerous mansions adorned with precious stones were built, destined for the angels, the ministers of the kingdom of light. <br>
    <sup>5</sup> Surrounding Eden and the angelic mansions, God built a wall of bright jasper, along which large pearl portals could be seen. With joy, the Eternal contemplated the Dream Capital. The city in its splendor was like an ornate bride, ready to receive her husband. <br>
    <sup>6</sup> Affectionately, the great Architect called her: Jerusalem, the City of Peace. God was about to bring the first rational creature into existence. He would be a glorious angel, among all the most honorable. Adorned by the shine of precious stones, that angel would live on Mount Zion, as representative of the King of kings before the Universe. <br>
    <sup>7</sup> With much love, the Creator began to mold the firstborn of angels. All wisdom applied when forming it, making it perfect. He tenderly granted his life; the beautiful angel, as if waking from a deep sleep, opened his eyes and looked at the face of his Author. With joy, the Eternal showed him the beauties of paradise, telling him of His plans, which were beginning to materialize. <br>
    <sup>8</sup> When he was led to the place of his abode, next to the throne, the prince of angels was grateful and, in a melodious voice, sang his first song of praise. From the heights of Zion, it was discovered, in the eyes of the beautiful angel, Jerusalem in its immensity and splendor. The river of life, sliding serenely in the middle of the City, resembled a long avenue, reflecting the beauties of the Garden of Eden and the angelic mansions. <br>
    <sup>9</sup> Wrapping the firstborn of angels with His mantle of light, the Eternal began to speak to him of the principles that would govern the universal kingdom. Physical and moral laws should be respected to the full extent of divine government. Moral laws were summed up in two basic principles: to love God above all things and others as Himself. Each rational creature should be a channel through which the Eternal could shed other life and light. That way, the Universe would grow in harmony, happiness and peace. <br>
    <sup>10</sup> In the kingdom of God, laws would not be imposed with tyranny; The subjects would be free. Obedience should arise spontaneously, in a gesture of recognition and gratitude. In that realm of freedom, disobedience would also be possible. The result of such behavior would be the emptying of vital forces. <br>
    <sup>11</sup> After revealing to the beautiful angel the laws of His government, the Eternal entrusted him with a mission of great responsibility: he would be the protector of those laws, and should honor and reveal the Universe ready to be created. With a heart overflowing with love for God and others, it would be up to him to be a model of perfection: he would be Lucifer, the bearer of light. The prince of the angels; Grateful for everything, he prostrated himself before the loving King, promising him eternal faithfulness. The Eternal continued His work of creation, bringing into existence innumerable hosts of angels, the ministers of the kingdom of light. <br>
    <sup>12</sup> The Holy City was populated by those radiant creatures who, happy and grateful, joined the voices in beautiful songs of praise to the Creator. God now brought into existence the Universe that, full of life, would revolve around His throne affirmed in Zion. Accompanied by His ministers, he set out for the great accomplishment. After contemplating the immense emptiness, the Eternal raised his mighty hands, ordering the materialization of the multiform wonders that were to compose the Cosmos. <br>
    <sup>13</sup> His order, like thunder, reverberated everywhere, causing, as if by charm, galaxies without numbers, full of worlds and suns — paradise of life and joy — all spinning harmoniously around Mount Zion. When witnessing such a great fact of the supreme King, the angelic hosts prostrated themselves, causing a song of triumph to pass through the illuminated space, in salutation to life. <br>
    <sup>14</sup> The whole Universe joined in that song of gratitude, in promise of eternal fidelity to the Creator. Guided by the Eternal, the angels began to know the riches of the Universe. On that sidereal excursion, they were admired at the immensity of the kingdom of light. Everywhere they found worlds inhabited by happy creatures who received them at party. The angels greeted us with songs that spoke of the good news of that kingdom of peace. <br>
    <sup>15</sup> As precious as life, the freedom to choose, through which creatures could show their love for the Creator, required proof of faithfulness. With the purpose of revealing it, the Eternal led the hosts through the illuminated space, until it approached an abyss of darkness that contrasted with the immense brightness of the galaxies. In the distance, that abyss had revealed itself insignificant in the eyes of the angels, like a spot without light; but as he approached, he showed himself in his enormity. <br>
    <sup>16</sup> The Creator, who at every step revealed to the angels the mysteries of His kingdom, was silent there, as if keeping a secret for Himself. The darkness of that abyss consisted in the test of faithfulness. Turning to the hosts, the Eternal solemnly affirmed: - "All the treasures of the light will be open to your knowledge, except the secrets hidden by darkness. You are free to serve me or not. Loving the light you will be bound to the Source of Life ". - <br>
    <sup>17</sup> With these words, God made separation between light and darkness, good and evil. The Universe was free to choose its destiny.

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">An eternity of harmony and peace. Lucifer, transmitter of the revelations of the Father to his angels. Assemblies on capital planets. Obedience to divine laws, foundation of progress and happiness. Lucifer is attracted by the darkness of the abyss. Lucifer, created for the Light Intervention of a loving Father The great inner struggle of Lucifer The gift of free will Theory of the science of good and evil Foundations of the Eternal kingdom Betrayal of Lucifer and a third of the hosts. The Eternal warns about the breaking of the Source of Life, the Universe put to the test, the inconsolable crying of the Father, the mysterious abyss, symbolic meaning of the kingdom of rebellion, the creation of the planet Earth.</p>

 <p>
    <sup>1</sup> The long-awaited dream of the Creator was concretized. Now, as a loving Father, he led the creatures through an eternity of harmony and peace. By virtue of the fulfillment of divine laws, the Universe expanded in happiness and glory. There was a strong jealousy of love, which united all strongly. Rational beings, endowed with the capacity of infinite unfolding, found indescribable pleasure in learning the inexhaustible treasures of divine Wisdom, transmitting them to the like. They were like channels through which The Source of Eternal Life nurtured all of love and light. <br>
    <sup>2</sup> In Jerusalem, the ministers of the kingdom met before the sovereign King, always ready to fulfill His purposes. It was through Lucifer that the Eternal revealed His designs. After receiving a new revelation, he promptly transmitted it to the angelic hosts. These, in turn, shared it with creation. In famous flight the angels were heading towards the capital planets, where, in large assemblies, the representatives of the other worlds met. In many of these assemblies, Lucifer was present, filling the participants with joy and admiration. Perfect in all virtues, he captivated them with his sympathy. <br>
    <sup>3</sup> No other angel was able to reveal like him the mysteries of the Eternal's love. The Universe, feeding on the Source of Life, expanded into an eternity of perfect peace. Obedience to divine laws was the foundation of all progress and happiness. Although aware of free will, the desire to depart from the Creator had never risen to the heart of any creature. This was the case for a long time, until such a problem broke into the life of the one who was the most intimate of the Eternal. <br>
    <sup>4</sup> Lucifer, who had dedicated his life to the knowledge of the mysteries of light, was gradually attracted to darkness. The King of the Universe, in the eyes of whom nothing can be covered up, sadly accompanied his steps on the downward path that leads to death. At first, a small curiosity led Lucifer to approach that deep abyss. Contemplating it, he began to investigate the reason for not being able to understand its enigma. <br>
    <sup>5</sup> Returning to his place of honor, next to the throne, he prostrated himself before the divine King, begging him: "Father, let me know the secrets of darkness, just as you reveal the light to me." - At the request of the beautiful angel, the Eternal, with an expressive voice of sadness, said: "My son, you were created for the light, which is life." - Convinced that the Creator would not reveal the treasures of darkness, Lucifer decided to understand the riddle for himself. He was judged qualified for so much. With this sad decision, the prince of angels allowed a spot of sin to arise in his heart that could bring a catastrophe to the Universe. <br>
    <sup>6</sup> Only God knew what was going on in Lucifer's heart. The angel, who had been created to be the bearer of light, was divorcing in thoughts of the kind Creator who, in an effort to prevent disaster, begged to remain by His side. A tremendous struggle began to lock inside. The desire to know the meaning of darkness was immense, yet, the pleas of that loving Father, whom he did not want to lose, tortured him. Seeing the suffering that his attitude caused to the Creator, he sometimes showed repentance, but fell again. <br>
    <sup>7</sup> Before creating the Universe, God had already foreseen the possibility of a rebellion. The risk of granting freedom to the creatures was immense, but without this gift, life would be meaningless. The Eternal did not want to reign over robots, programmed to do only His will. He wanted obedience to be the result of recognition and love, so he decided to take the big risk. Although he continued to search for the meaning of darkness, Lucifer did not intend to abandon the light. <br>
    <sup>8</sup> He struggled to reach a combination between those parts that, in the Eternal kingdom, coexisted separately. Finally, with a feeling of exaltation, he conceived a deceptive theory, which he intended to present to the Universe as a new system of government, superior to the Eternal's government. He called his theory "the science of good and evil." Structured in logic, the science of good and evil proved attractive to Lucifer's eyes, seeming to reveal a sense of life superior to that offered by the Creator, whose kingdom enabled only experimental knowledge of good. <br>
    <sup>9</sup> In the new system, there would be a balance between good and evil, between love and selfishness, light and darkness. Throughout the time when the science of good and evil matured in his mind, Lucifer would know how to keep it a secret in front of the Universe. He continued in his position of honor, fulfilling the function of Bearer of Light. However, as much as he tried to pretend, his countenance no longer revealed joy in serving the Eternal. The divine King, who suffered in silence, sought, through His revelations of love, to prepare the rational creatures for the great approach that was approaching. <br>
    <sup>10</sup> He knew that many would listen to temptation, turning his back. The night of the test would make the true faithful stand out, however - those who served the Creator not for interest, but for love. "Seeing that the time of the test was coming, and that Lucifer was ready to betray him before the Universe, the Eternal, who had never ceased to reveal the treasures of his wisdom, became silent and contemplative. <br>
    <sup>11</sup> Silence revived the memory of that first sidereal excursion in the heart of the hosts, when, after showing them the riches of the kingdom of light, God became silent before that abyss. They remembered His words: "All the treasures of light will be open to your knowledge, except the secrets hidden by darkness. You are free to serve me or not. Loving the light you will be bound to the source of life." Lucifer, who He had begun to covet the throne of God, inquired about the motive of His silence.The Creator, contemplating it with infinite sadness, said: "The hour of darkness has come. You are free to carry out your purposes. ” <br>
    <sup>12</sup> Seeing that the propitious moment for the propagation of his theory had arrived, Lucifer summoned the angels for a special meeting. The hosts, eager to know the meaning of the Father's silence, took their places next to the magnificent angel, who had always revealed to them the treasures of the kingdom of light. Lucifer began his speech by exalting, as usual, the government of the Eternal. In a broad retrospective, he reminded them of the great revelations that had enriched them throughout that eternity. <br>
    <sup>13</sup> The divine silence presented him as being the indication that the Universe had reached the fullness of knowledge that came from the light. Silently, the Eternal paved the way for the understanding of mysteries not yet dreamed, kept until then beyond the limits of His government. Surprised, the hosts learned of Lucifer's experience of darkness. With eloquence, he told them about the science of good and evil, indicating it as the path of greatest realizations. <br>
    <sup>14</sup> The effect of his words was soon felt throughout the Universe. The question was decisive and explosive, generating discord for the first time. Rational beings, in their test, would have to choose to remain only with the knowledge of the light, which Lucifer claimed to have reached his limit, or venture into the knowledge of the science of good and evil. In the beginning, the angels debated at the question, then afterwards the entire Universe put to the test. It seemed that the science of good and evil was to take away most of the creatures, however, little by little, many who at first got soaked with the theory, woke up from the illusion of it, reaffirming their fidelity to the kingdom of the light. <br>
    <sup>15</sup> At the end of that conflict, which dragged on for a long time, a third of the stars in the sky were revealed next to Lucifer, and the rest, although shocked by the test next to the Eternal. The science of good and evil was proclaimed by Lucifer as a new system of government. But how to exercise it, if the Eternal continued to reign in Zion? They needed to find a way to get him out of there. The council, formed by the rebel angels, began to deal with that. They decided, finally, to request the throne for a certain time, in which they could demonstrate the excellence of the new system of government. In case it was approved by the Universe, the new system would be established forever; otherwise, the domain would return to the Creator. <br>
    <sup>16</sup> Thus, Lucifer, accompanied by his hosts, approached arrogantly before that suffering Father, making such a request. The Eternal was not ambitious, he only wanted good for His creatures. If the science of good and evil really consisted of a greater good, it would not oppose its implantation, yielding the throne to its defenders. More He knew that this path would lead to unhappiness and death. Moved by His protective love, the Creator disregarded the request of the rebel hosts, who turned away enraged. <br>
    <sup>17</sup> When the throne was denied, Lucifer and his hosts began to accuse the divine King, claiming to be his government of tyranny. They claimed to be his permanence on the throne the most obvious demonstration of His arbitrariness. Hadn't he granted them freedom to choose? Why neutralize it now, preventing them from implementing a superior government system? The accusations of the rebel hosts reverberated throughout the Universe, making it appear that the Eternal's government was unfair. This brought deep distress to those who remained faithful to the kingdom of light. <br>
    <sup>18</sup> Not knowing how to refute such accusations, these creatures, silenced by moral pain, longed for the moment when new revelations from the Creator could clarify the mysteries of that great conflict. The accusations and blasphemies of the rebel hosts reached the climax when the Eternal, in a surprising gesture, rose from His throne, as soon as he left it. The infidels, in the expectation of a conquest, quieted down, while a feeling of fear penetrated the heart of the subjects of the light. <br>
    <sup>19</sup> Would He surrender the dominion of all creation, to get rid of vile accusations? According to the logic from which Lucifer based his teachings, there was no other alternative to the Creator. In this tremendous expectation, the Universe accompanied the steps of God. In a gesture of humility, the Creator stripped himself of His crown and His royal robe, placing them on the white throne. In His countenance there was no expression of resentment or anger, but of infinite love and sadness. With solemnity, the Eternal proclaimed that the decisive moment had arrived, when each creature should seal its decision by the light or darkness. <br>
    <sup>20</sup> In a wide revelation, he warned of the consequences of a break with the Source of Life. With a look of tenderness the Creator looked at his children. It was a look of humility, which, full of love, begged to remain by His side. Countless creatures, moved, corresponded to His look of kindness, while a crowd remained downcast. Lucifer and his followers were aware of the seriousness of that moment. It was still possible to turn back their plans, surrendering repentance to the divine Father who had always loved them. <br>
    <sup>21</sup> While crestfallen considered the final decision, Lucifer and his followers heard the song of those who, in recognition and gratitude, stood beside the Eternal. The last fight was at the heart of the infidels who, shuddering, came to think about retiring. Finally, the memory of the recent divine gesture, stripping the crown, gave them the certainty that the government would be handed over to them. Seeing that the Throne remained empty, Lucifer and his hosts, dominated by greed, finally broke with the Creator. Seeing a third of the subjects go through the divisions of eternal separation, God let out the distressing pain that for so long martyred His heart, curving in inconsolable crying. <br>
    <sup>22</sup> Contemplating His rebellious children, he raised his voice in a painful lamentation: "My children, my children! I can no longer call you that! I would like to have you in my arms so much! I remember when I formed you with love! You came forth happy and perfect, in chords of hope in eternal harmony! I lived for you, covering you with glory and power! You were my joy! Why did your hearts change so much? Oh what else could I have done to make you stay with me? Today my soul bleeds in pain from the eternal separation! <br>
    <sup>23</sup> How will I look to the empty places where so many times the voices raised in festive hosannas, without a mixture of happiness and pain coming to mind ?! Infinite nostalgia already invades my being, and I know it will be eternal! Today my heart broke and broke; I will carry the scars forever! After proclaiming in sorrow so painful lamentation, the Eternal one addressed Lucifer, the cause of all evil, saying: "You received a name of honor when you were created. Now they will not call you more Lucifer, but Satan, the enemy of Creator and His laws. " After lamenting the downfall of the rebel hosts, the Eternal, in slow steps, was absent from the Garden of Eden, place of the Universal Throne. <br>
    <sup>24</sup> Where would His dwelling be now? The faithful hosts accompanied reverent His mysterious steps of abandonment, which seemed to reveal a difficult future, of suffering and humiliation. Would the rebels occupy the divine throne, desecrating it as the domain of sin? This inquiry tortured the hearts of the subjects of the Eternal. Leaving His beloved City, the Lord of light led himself, in the midst of the glories of the Universe, in the direction of the immense abyss, which he had silenced until then. There he stopped once more, muted, while he seemed to read in the darkness a future of great struggles. <br>
    <sup>25</sup> Faced with the suffering of the Eternal, expressed in the sadness of his countenance, the faithful could finally understand the meaning of that mysterious abyss: it consisted of a symbolic representation of the kingdom of rebellion. In the saddened face of God there was, finally, a glow that encouraged the faithful. Raising the powerful arms in the dark, he ordered loudly: "Let there be light." Immediately, the light of His presence flooded the deep abyss and, triumphing over darkness, revealed an unfinished world, covered by crystalline waters. With that gesture, the Eternal began a great battle for the claim of His government of light; battle of love against selfishness; of justice against injustice; of humility against pride; of freedom against slavery; of life against death. <br>
    <sup>26</sup> Battle that, without truce, would extend until, at the desired dawn, the divine King could return victorious to the holy Mount Zion, where, enthroned in the midst of the praises of the redeemed, he would reign forever in perfect peace. The darkness, in its escape, pointed towards the final annihilation of the rebellion. The abundant waters that covered that world, hitherto hidden, symbolized the eternal life that for the faithful would be conquered by the love that everything sacrifices. The revealed world was the earth. Visited by darkness and light, she would be the stage of the great struggle. The faithful rejoiced at the triumph of the light on that first day, when darkness in their fury rolled over the planet, succumbing it in dense darkness. <br>
    <sup>27</sup> The light, which seemed defeated, was reborn victorious in a beautiful dawn. Upon scratching the light of a second day, the Eternal ordered: "There is an expansion in the midst of the waters, and there is separation between water and waters." Immediately, the heat of His light caused an immense amount of steam to rise from the waters, enveloping the planet in a blanket of indigo transparency. Thus the atmosphere arose, with its perfect mixture of gases that would be essential for the life that would soon crown the planet. The Creator, contemplating the expansion, called it "heavens." <br>
    <sup>28</sup> The atmosphere, which filled the earth with brightness, darkened as the twilight of another sunset ensued.
</p><br>



<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Creation works continue. Water separation. Vegetation. The garden of Eden is transferred to the new planet. The great luminaries. Sea creatures. Volatile creatures. Earth creatures. Creation of Adam, the first man. Adam prostrates in reverent adoration. Paradise state of the earth. Adam admired a creature and called it "lamb." The lamb, a likeness of the Eternal. The promise of a companion. Adam's deep sleep.

The tree of life and the tree of science of good and evil. Satan opts for deception as a weapon to make man eat the forbidden fruit.</p>

 <p>
    <sup>1</sup> When darkness was overcome on the third day, the Creator continued His work, bringing forth the immense continents that were still beneath the surface of the waters. With raised hands he ordered: "Join the waters under the heavens in one place and the dry portion appears." In prompt obedience, the crystalline waters gave their superior position to the dry portion that rose, overlapping them. In the lower regions of the earth, the waters would continue to reflect the heavenly glow, being a snack for thirsty creatures. In that gesture of humility, the waters foreshadowed the Creator, who in the great struggle had descended into the deepest abyss to make eternal life reborn in thirsty souls. <br>
    <sup>2</sup> Contemplating the face of that new world, the Eternal called the dry part "earth," and the gathering of the waters he called "seas." In his powerful voice he continued, ordering: "Produce the earth green grass, grass that gives seed, fruitful tree that bears fruit according to its species, whose seed is in it on the earth." In obedience to the divine command, the solid surface of the planet was covered with all kinds of vegetation: beautiful meadows to bloom, green fields crisscrossed by crystalline rivers, endless forests where leafy trees allowed to hang tasty fruits of countless species. The earth was like a cloth where the Creator, by the power of His word, colored pictures of unparalleled beauty. <br>
    <sup>3</sup> While with admiration the hosts contemplated the beauties of that creation, they were surprised to recognize on the new planet the garden of Eden, place of the divine throne. The Eternal, by the power of His word, had transferred him to the bosom of that special world, where in justice the government of the Universe would be confirmed. On that spring day, the breeze gently caressed the green forests and the flowering meadows, flooding the atmosphere with a soft aroma and freshness. Contemplating His work, the Creator happily exclaimed: "Behold, everything is very good." Exuberant, the planet fulfilled another day in its harmonious rotation. The faithful hosts could now better understand the importance of divine light. His absence had obfuscated, on that night, the beauties of Zion. On that new day, the Creator would express His great power, giving the earth luminaries that would fill it with light and heat. <br>
    <sup>4</sup> Those luminaries would remain forever as symbols of the spiritual presence of the Eternal, which is the source of all light. Contemplating the dark and empty space that extended around the earth, with a powerful voice he ordered: "Let there be luminaries in the expansion of the heavens, so that there is separation between day and night; be they by signs and for certain times, to days and years. And be for luminaries in the expansion of the heavens to light the earth. " Immediately, the space became radiant due to the brightness of the sun and the reflection of planets and satellites. Before this demonstration of power, the faithful hosts knelt in reverent worship. On the fourth day, the Eternal created the worlds of our solar system not to be inhabited like the earth, but for the balance of the system. <br>
    <sup>5</sup> They also filled the sky with glare, softening the darkness of earthly nights. Turning his eyes to the ground, the hosts were glad to see her radiant in colors. Very close to it you could see the moon that, with its silver reflection, would scare away the deep night shadows. Wrapped up by that enchanting scenario, the children of light, rejoicing, greeted the dawn of the fifth day, which would be of many surprises. The Eternal would turn the festive land by the presence of countless species of irrational animals that would inhabit the entire surface of the planet. That creation would have continuity on the sixth day. <br>
    <sup>6</sup> Raising the mighty hands, the Creator, looking first at the crystal clear waters, ordered: "Produce the abundantly reptilian waters of the living soul." Immediately, the waters became undulating by the presence of countless species of reptiles that, happy and grateful, celebrated the existence in a continuous swim and jump. From microscopic beings to great whales, all appeared in complete harmony, reflecting in their nature the love of the Creator. Putting his eyes on the indigo atmosphere that rested on the green forests, the Eternal continued: "Birds fly over the face of the expansion of the heavens." Through His order, the Heavens were filled with colorful birds that, flying in all directions, had in their hearts a song of gratitude for life. This song filled the air, mixing with the perfume of flowering bushes. <br>
    <sup>7</sup> Contemplating with pleasure His earthly creatures, the Eternal blessed them by saying: "Fructify and multiply and henchid the waters in the seas, and the birds multiply on the earth." Rejoicing, the faithful hosts witnessed the dawn of the sixth day. And what would God create on that new day? This question reigned in the minds of all rational beings. They were sure that something very special was about to happen. Raising the mighty arms, the Eternal ordered: "Produce the living soul earth according to its species: cattle, reptiles and wild beasts of the earth, according to its species." His powerful voice was quickly heard and, in the woods and fields, the result of His creative power could be seen. <br>
    <sup>8</sup> Animals of all species woke up to a happy existence, in the middle of a paradise of perfect peace. The land became extremely beautiful, which princess adorned to receive its king and lord. Who would that special being be? Moving with majesty, the Eternal came down to the glories of the new world, heading to the garden of Eden, place of the divine throne. The angels of the light accompanied him reverently, stopping like clouds over the skies of paradise. The entire Universe watched with deep interest the development of the acts of the Creator, in response to the accusations of his enemies. <br>
    <sup>9</sup> The moment was decisive. Everything indicated that the Eternal would prove not to be tyrant or selfish, crowning someone on Mount Zion. Satan and his followers did not doubt that the kingdom would be given to them and they would reign victorious in the bosom of that ancient abyss, where darkness and light were now intertwined. The subjects of the light shuddered at that perspective. Next to the source of the river of life, the Eternal knelt solemnly and, with the natural elements of the Earth, began to mold, with much love, a special creature. After a few moments, the body, still lifeless, of the first man was extended before the Creator. The Eternal looked at him and, after stroking his cold, discolored face, he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man began to live. <br>
    <sup>10</sup> As if waking up from a dream, the man opened his eyes and contemplated the sweet face of His Creator who, smiling, kissed his face now colorful and full of life. He was moved to hear the Eternal say in a soft and affectionate voice: "My son, my dear son!" Because he was born on earth, the first man received the name of Adam. Taking him by the hand, the Eternal lifted him. Without perceiving the scene of glare that surrounded him, Adam, in a gesture of gratitude for existence, enveloped the Creator in a tender embrace, prostrating himself in reverent worship. The faithful hosts who admired witnessed the great divine fulfillment, excited at the human gesture, also prostrated themselves in reverent worship. <br>
    <sup>11</sup> Then they united the voices in a song of joy in salutation to that special creature, who woke up to life at such a decisive moment for the Universe. With a heart full of happiness, Adam joined the angels in his song of praise. His voice, as it passed through the flowery surroundings, was mixed with the song of the birds and the death of the animals that approached festively. In a walk of unforgettable surprises, Adam was made aware of the beauties of his home. With admiration, he saw Mount Zion, where the river of life flowed, in a cascade of light. The glorious mountain lay crowned by a beautiful rainbow. In his steps, he followed the course of the crystalline river, which glided serenely amidst the wonders of Eden. <br>
    <sup>12</sup> One admired the tall trees that, soaked by the breeze, left abundant flowers and fruits hanging from the branches. He leaned here and there, attracted by the glow of precious stones that adorned the lawn everywhere. With intense joy, Adam was aware of the infinite species of animals that populated the garden. All were meek and submissive and lived in perfect harmony and happiness. Stopping in his footsteps, Adam admired the whiteness and tenderness of an animal that was jumping on the grass. Approaching, he took it in his arms, dedicating a special affection. Well, it was nice to stroke her white wool! His sweet eyes reflected a glow of love and humility. There was something special about that little animal. Affectionately, Adam called him "lamb." <br>
    <sup>13</sup> With the little animal in his arms, Adam looked grateful toward the Eternal and worshiped Him. Contemplating His white robes, His expressive eyes of an unparalleled love, Adam discovered that he had in his arms a symbol of his Author. Happy, he exclaimed: "Oh, Lord, this little lamb clad in such white wool, with an expressive look of so much love, looks like You. I want to have him always with me." Watching the animals, Adam perceived that they enjoyed a special fellowship. I saw happy couples everywhere living for each other. His thoughts turned to His Companion. He looked around and was surprised not to see him. The Eternal had concealed himself on purpose, becoming invisible. <br>
    <sup>14</sup> Adam felt lonely in the midst of that paradise. With whom would you share your happiness and love? there were animals there, but they were irrational, unable to share their ideals. He was born in his heart, walking alone in that sunset, a burning desire to find someone who could always be by his side. While Adam looked toward the distant hills in the hope of seeing someone, the Eternal appeared at his side and said: "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a companion." <br>
    <sup>15</sup> Adam was happy to hear from the Creator that promise, just at the moment when he so longed to have someone so that he would always be visible at his side. Taken by a deep sleep, Adam leaned back in the chest of his loving Creator who, with caresses, made him numb. In his subconscious the first colorful dreams arose: Contemplate the Eternal's tender gaze; he hears the harmonious sound of angelic music; discover the wonders around: Mount Zion with its rainbow; The river of life; the meadows in bloom; the animals that greeted him at the party. The scenes that surrounded him in his longing are repeated in his dream; he looks around in the hope of finding his partner, but he doesn't see it. He feels lonely in his dream, and that makes him look for someone with whom to share his existence. <br>
    <sup>16</sup> His gaze stretches through greening countryside, seeing in the distance flowery hills. While walking hopefully, feel the gentle breeze gently stroke her hair. Talk to the breeze: "Breeze, you seem to be who I am looking for so much; you caress my hair; you kiss my face; you have the perfume of green bushes! If I could see your face, I would kiss it; if I could touch your hair, make long braids and decorate them with the flowers of our garden! " After walking in the dream through the meadows of paradise, Adam stopped while contemplating the surrounding landscape. He admired not seeing the effect of the breeze on the flowering branches. But how, if he felt it warmly on his face? <br>
    <sup>17</sup> Then he began to wake up from his dream. Still with his eyes closed, he remembered the moment when, sleepy, he lay on the Eternal's chest. Would the breeze be the touch of His hands? With this question he opened his eyes and was excited to see a pretty woman who, with scented hands, caressed her face with love. It was the breeze of his dream; the promise of a Creator who just wanted to make him happy. Now Adam was complete, for he had Eve, who was flesh of his flesh and bones of his bones. Taking her by the hand, Adam invited her for a walk of unforgettable surprises. He would show his companion the beauties of his home. <br>
    <sup>18</sup> Sensitized Eva stopped at every step, attracted by the flowers that exhaled soft perfumes; for the birds that sang happy songs; for the animals that followed them submissive; by the vegetation of rich nuances; through the crystalline waters of the river of life that flowed cascade from Mount Zion. Everything in paradise was perfect and beautiful, but nothing equaled the human being, created in the image of God. They turned to each other in admiration and caresses. Soaked by that love, they remained until sunset. With delight, the young couple began to contemplate the setting sun that, through pink rays, colored the sky in a beautiful tree. <br>
    <sup>19</sup> It was the sixth day that came to an end, giving rise to the hours of a special day: Saturday. That day, in its meaning, would be solemn for all subjects of the Eternal, for its dawn would bring victory to the kingdom of light. The sun, which on the sixth day had brightened nature with its brightness and heat, was hidden, leaving it in cold shadows. The cheerful birds, silencing their trills, looked for their nests while the other animals were collected. Only the couple remained motionless, trying to see, in the last flash that went out on the horizon, the hope of a new dawn. They investigated the sense of darkness when, among the bushes, they saw a beautiful place, whose silver rays bathed in silver rays bathed the nature in soft luminosity. <br>
    <sup>20</sup> The whole sky was illuminated by the glow of the stars. Admired, they discovered that the night was only darkness when they looked down. Adam and Eve in their innocence did not know that that night symbolized the bleak future of humanity. When they understood it, they would be comforted to contemplate the brightness of the heavens: the place would speak of hope and the twinkling stars would attest to the interest of the hosts of light in clearing their moral darkness, giving encouragement to sinners. But only those who, diverting their eyes from the earth, contemplated the high heavens would be enlightened. <br>
    <sup>21</sup> After contemplating the sky for some time in its luminosity, the couple remembered the beauties of paradise, turned their eyes, seeking to see them. They were, however, hidden in the middle of the shadows. How much they wished for dawn, for only he would bring paradise! Before the longing of the human heart, the Eternal appeared in the midst of darkness, returning to the couple the joy of meeting again in a colorful garden. Bathed in soft light, they were now walking through green and flowery meadows. The brightness of the Creator woke up the nature where they passed, coloring and brightening everything around. <br>
    <sup>22</sup> The couple, admired, learned that next to the Eternal they could have a paradise in the middle of the night. Feeling sleepy, Adam and Eve lay on the lap of the loving Father, who made them fall asleep sweetly, hopeful in a happy awakening. Leaving them on the soft grass, the Eternal rose to the side of the contemplative hosts. He would manifest again at dawn, waking the couple for the most solemn event, which would reduce to dust the most vile accusations of the enemies. The dark and cold night, through its long hours, seemed to mock the light. Would you forever obfuscate the beauties of creation? Oh, never! The sun would not recede in the face of darkness; He would appear shortly as a liberator, snatching with his warm rays the nature of the cold claws, giving him life and color. <br>
    <sup>23</sup> In a final challenge, darkness became dense in the hours before dawn. The night lashed out his forces to fight for usurped rule. Finally, a flash appeared in the east that seemed to speak of hope in a new day. The sky gradually became colorful of a reddish alive. The helpless darkness withdrew from the rising force of light and was consumed in its escape. Nature began to wake up from the long night, reflecting in its bosom the nostalgic rays. Flowers would open, exhaling perfumes of joy; Animals and birds, silenced at night, joined the voices in a triumphant chant in salutation at the dawn of that great day. <br>
    <sup>24</sup> The black night had come to an end, giving rise to the daylight dreamed - it was a special meaning for God, because it foreshadowed the final victory of His kingdom over the dominion of rebellion. - The Eternal would now wake up His human children who, bathed in the light of His presence, had slept in the hope of a happy dawn. In a festive march, all the holy hosts, with songs of victory, accompanied him to the paradise bathed in light. When they were close, the Creator stopped staring at the sleeping couple, and exclaimed softly: "Wake up my children." His voice entered Adam and Eve's ears, waking them up for the happiest communion. <br>
    <sup>25</sup> How quickly he scratched the long-awaited morning, bringing in his light the sweet paradise, lost in that night! With joy the couple greeted their divine Creator, joining the angels in triumphant antiphons. The Universe lived a truly solemn moment. On that festive morning, the Eternal was to reveal the greatness of His character, which is justice and love. The accusations that His government was selfish and tyranny would be refuted. In the eyes of all the rational creatures of the vast Universe, God led the young couple to Mount Zion, place of the divine throne. <br>
    <sup>26</sup> There, before the shudder of the muted hosts, the Creator, in a surprising gesture, covered the man with the royal robe, placing on his head the crown that had been coveted by Lucifer. Moved by deep gratitude for the supreme honor conferred, deep childbirth Adam and Eve bowed reverently, placing their precious crown at the feet of the Creator, in sign of submission. A cry of victory followed that human gesture that shook the entire Creation. The children of the light, who for so long had suffered insults and humiliations in the face of the constant accusations of the rebel hosts, praised in praise the blessed God, who in His work of justice denied the enemies, revealing His character of humility, detachment and love. <br>
    <sup>27</sup> Having constituted man as the lord of all creation, the Eternal, with a solemn voice, began to make him aware of the greatness of his mission. As a faithful steward, you should take care of paradise, keeping the source of the river of life clean. The laws of justice and love, foundations of the kingdom of light, should be honored. As a rational scepter, it would be up to man, in a gesture of recognition and gratitude, to freely accept the government of the One who created it. The hosts, who marveled witnessed the revelation of divine detachment, understood that the Lord of Light would no longer rule the Universe, except with human consent. <br>
    <sup>28</sup> Man, by the will of the Eternal, was made the arbiter of creation; in his glorious being, made in the image of the Creator, the seal of eternal dominion shone. After revealing to the couple the infinite honor and responsibility of their mission, the Creator made them aware of the spiritual conflict that was working for the conquest of universal dominion: Lucifer, who for countless ages had served the divine King in Zion, had been corrupted by pride and selfishness, being followed by a third of the rational hosts; they sought now to dethrone the Eternal, dishonoring him with vile accusations. <br>
    <sup>29</sup> Having revealed to the human being the painful situation in which the Universe was, the Eternal, in a solemn gesture, showed them two tall trees that, loaded with great fruits, rose on both banks of the river that was born from the throne. To the one who rose to the right the Lord revealed to be the tree of life monument of the kingdom of light. To the one who stood on the other shore he revealed himself to be the tree of the science of good and evil - a symbol of rebellion. - By eating the fruit of the tree of life, man would manifest his submission to the Creator, which is the Source of life and light. To eat from the other tree would be to give the enemy the dominion of Zion. <br>
    <sup>30</sup> The inevitable result of that step would be eternal death, not only for the human being, but for all creation, which would be reduced to chaos under the fury of rebellion. After contemplating the two tall trees, which externalized in their fruits such infinite responsibility, Adam prostrated himself before the Creator, saying: "You are worthy Lord to reign over the Universe, because by Your wisdom, love and power all things were created and they subsist. " On Saturday, emblem of divine triumph, swelled with praise. <br>
    <sup>31</sup> All the children of the light joined the human being in the most harmonious song of exaltation to Him whose greatness is unparalleled. It was with horror that Satan and his followers witnessed the great realization of the Eternal. They witnessed with bitterness the joy of the faithful before the coronation of man, an event that threw down the strong accusations they had raised against the divine government. Full of anger and frustration, they now considered his sad condition. How terrible and humiliating was the thought of seeing their plans of rebellion vanish before the Creator, similar to the shadows of that night. <br>
    <sup>32</sup> If they could, they thought, they would fill the Sabbath with darkness, erasing any hope of victory from the minds of the subjects of the Eternal. Finally, in their considerations, Satan and his leaders understood that they had an opportunity: in the middle of the garden of Eden, on the heights of Zion, the tree of the science of good and evil was rising, next to the river of life. A human gesture would be enough, nothing more, and they would have under their power, for ever, the coveted domain. But how to seduce him? Encouraged by the prospect of a conquest, Satan sought ingeniously to formulate a boarding plan. He knew that if he failed in his attempt, all hopes of triumph would have dissolved, all his dreams of adventure crumbling. He concluded that deception was to be his powerful weapon. <br>
    <sup>33</sup> Was it not through him that he managed to dominate a third of the heavenly hosts ?! He would wait, therefore, for an auspicious moment to arm his ambush.

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Eden, a kingdom of eternal joy. Visit and daily instruction of the Eternal. Work, source of development of faculties. Through visits of celestial beings, Adam and Eve acquired knowledge about the rebellion of Lucifer. God reveals to His hosts Satan's evil intentions and sends two angels to warn man. Satan takes possession of a snake to deceive Eve. Arguments of Satan to make Eve fall. Adam's intense internal struggle in the face of his wife's fallen condition. Adam eats of the fruit, he remains at his wife's side paying the high price of his rebellion, wonderful revelation of the rescue plan, the nature of the creations and of Adam and Eve changes, the Father promises them lasting garments.</p>

 <p>
    <sup>1</sup> In Eden the sweet calm of perfect peace reigned. Everywhere the kind little birds made their cheerful trills heard in constant praise of the Creator. All nature at flowering seemed to proclaim a kingdom of eternal joy. Animals in union jumped everywhere, always submissive to man, the lord of that lovely paradise. Everything was happiness for the couple; but this became more intense in the rotation of those spring days. The tree, which with its beauty colored the sky forewarning the dark nights, also announced the time of the Eternal's daily visit. Together, in the light of His presence, they spent a long time in happy conversation. <br>
    <sup>2</sup> With courage, the couple told the Lord the amazing wonders that they discovered every day in nature. God, with love, discovered the meaning of each being. How grateful they were for the beautiful lessons learned at His feet! As each day passed, there was greater love, respect and admiration for the great Creator. How good He had been, bringing them into existence and granting them a home so full of delicacies! When they woke up to the joys of each day, the caresses and sweet song of the Eternal came to mind, which made them fall asleep every night. <br>
    <sup>3</sup> The life of Adam and Eve in Eden was not idle. Garden care was recommended to them. Its occupation was not annoying, on the contrary, it was pleasant and invigorating. The Creator had indicated work as a source of benefits for man, in order to occupy the mind and strengthen the body, developing all the faculties. In mental and physical activity, man found a high pleasure. It was common for the young couple to receive visits from celestial beings. <br>
    <sup>4</sup> Visitors always had news to report and questions to ask. They spent a long time hearing about them talking about the wonders of the kingdom of light. Through those visitors, Adam and Eve began to have extensive knowledge of Lucifer's rebellion and its eternal consequences. Visitors, Adam and Eve always asked to be taught the harmonious heavenly songs. How they delighted to join the voices to the angelic choir! In His omniscience, God had knowledge of the enemy's terrible intention. <br>
    <sup>5</sup> Summoning His main hosts, He revealed to them with regret the imminent danger that loomed over the Universe. Satan was to ambush in order to take man to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Before that revelation, the children of the light were fearful, for they knew the tremendous ease of Satan in linking innocent creatures and binding them in their meshes of death. In the solemn council, they decided to send, urgently, messengers to warn the man of great danger. <br>
    <sup>6</sup> Two powerful angels were charged with that decisive mission. Immediately, commissioned messengers stormed through the gates of Jerusalem, reaching the bosom of infinite space. In moments, they passed immensities, crossing galaxies in the course. They entered the tunnel of the constellation Orion, approaching the new system. They could now see a short distance from the blue planet, where the destiny of the Universe was to be determined. <br>
    <sup>7</sup> In Eden, there was relaxation. The young couple continued in their innocent activities, enjoying the pleasure of a happy life. They were far from thinking that at that moment all or all the children of the light were tense, thinking about their threatened future. Then they saw in the clear sky the sign of the approach of the heavenly visitors and they raised their arms in joyful salutation. However, Adam and Eve admired each other, for not seeing the same joy in their countenance. <br>
    <sup>8</sup> Visitors brought an expression of anxiety on their faces that they could not understand. They tried to change the sad faction, telling them the new discoveries made in paradise. The messengers, still, not having time available as on other occasions, interrupted them with words of warning. Satan would ambush them in order to take them to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If they heard temptation, they would succumb the entire creation into the abyss of eternal chaos. <br>
    <sup>9</sup> The angels reminded them that the kingdom had been entrusted to them as a sacred deposit, owing, in a life of faithfulness, to honor Him who for love was stripped, placing himself in a position of host of the human being. Adam and Eve should be firm before the insinuations of the enemy, for thus they would seal the eternal victory of the kingdom of light. Speaking to them of the happy reward that would follow their triumph, the angels revealed that it was God's plan to transfer the Heavenly Jerusalem to Earth. There, again coupled to paradise, it would remain forever. <br>
    <sup>10</sup> And man, submissive to the Creator, would reign for ever and ever on Mount Zion, in the midst of the praises of the universal hosts. More all that depended entirely on human positioning in the face of the temptations of the enemy, who would do everything to snatch the kingdom. Adam and Eve were afraid to know Satan's plans, but they were comforted to learn that he could not do him any harm, forcing them to eat the forbidden fruit. If, however, he tried to intimidate them with his power, all the Eternal's hosts would come to his aid. <br>
    <sup>11</sup> The messengers of the light concluded their mission by recommending the couple to remain vigilant, always keeping in mind the responsibility that rested upon them. They should not be separated from each other, not even for a moment, because they alone could be seduced. Adam and Eve, grateful for the angels' warnings, joined the voices in a song of promise in an eternal victory. They were sure that they would never abandon the blessed Creator, hearing the tempter's voice. <br>
    <sup>12</sup> Encouraged by the human promise, the two messengers returned to the bosom of the Celestial Jerusalem where, together with the holy hosts, they would anxiously await the desired triumph. Satan saw the messengers approaching paradise and heard the song of man promising an eternal victory. That song made his envy and hatred increase so that he could not contain them. He then told his followers that he would soon silence that irritating voice. He would do everything to transform human praise into blasphemies of the Creator. <br>
    <sup>13</sup> The rebel hosts were curious to know their boss's plans, but were warned by him that they should wait until everything was forever determined. If man heard his voice, eating from the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would be victorious, forever possessing the domain of the Universe. If man resisted, remaining faithful to the Creator, there would be no hope for them. Paradise seemed to be surrounded by eternal security, but in the countenance of man one could see an expression of fear. <br>
    <sup>14</sup> Since the angels departed, Adam and Eve remained silent, meditating reverently on the enormous responsibility of their mission. They thought of the seriousness of that impending test that would seal their future and that of the entire Creation. Encouraged, however, before the thought of victory, they once again united the voices in a song that expressed the certainty of the coveted victory. That melody removed from their minds all the fear of defeat and, happily, they ran through the green meadows, accompanied by the fiery animals that seemed to commemorate the great conquest. <br>
    <sup>15</sup> They felt safe in their paradise, totally forgotten about the danger of a possible assault. Satan, who was watching the couple closely, perceived that his opportunity was coming. He approached the paradise invisibly, and was waiting for the best time to arm his ambush. Unaware of the presence of the enemy, the couple continued in their detached joy, playing carelessly with the animals. In the deranged countenance of Satan a malicious smile was stamped, witnessing a carelessness of the couple: in their exaltation, they had stopped attending the last recommendation of the messengers, turning away from each other. <br>
    <sup>16</sup> The cunning enemy, wasting no time, took possession of a snake, the most beautiful in paradise, making it gracefully approach Eva. Eva, who sat on the grass playing with animals, perceived the presence of the attractive snake, whose body reflected the colors of the rainbow. She was admired to see her pick flowers and fruits from the garden, placing them at her feet. Grateful, he took her in his arms, dedicating affection. <br>
    <sup>17</sup> Having conquered the affection of the woman, Satan, in his cunning, began to attract her to be next to the tree of the science of good and evil. Without realizing the danger, Eva accompanied the snake to the test tree. There, holding the hidden enemy in his arms, he caressed him and said words of love. With the brightness of seduction in his eyes, the snake began to speak. His words were full of wisdom and tenderness and his voice like that of an angel. <br>
    <sup>18</sup> Eve could hardly believe her eyes. His joy became immense for having such a fantastic creature in his arms. They began to talk about many things: love; the beauties of the garden; The power of the Creator. Eva was admired at the extensive knowledge of the snake, which ran with mastery on any subject. Wrapped by that experience, Eva completely forgot about her partner. Not even the angels' warnings passed through his mind. Adam, entirely forgotten about the advice of the heavenly messengers, had appeared in the company of some animals. <br>
    <sup>19</sup> After a while, the memory of the warnings received came with momentum in his mind. The last words spoken by the angels sounded clearly in his ears: "Do not depart from each other ... Do not separate for a moment, it is dangerous." His heart pounded when he didn't see Eva at his side. Then he raised his voice in an anxious shout. His voice, when impacting through the vaults of paradise, however, did not bring an answer. The silence almost stifled him. In his affliction he ran from side to side, looking for her, in vain. <br>
    <sup>20</sup> In that anxious search, she felt the breeze caress her hair and remembered her first dream. That memory, however, was undone at the thought of the danger that threatened them. With the mind taken by a great sense of guilt, Adam hastened the pace in the anguished search. Where would your beloved be? Would he wrap her in time in his arms, freeing her from falling? More than once he raised his voice in an anxious shout that reverberated throughout the garden: "Eva, where are you?" He waited for an answer, but heard only an empty echo that despaired. He remembered the tree of science of good and evil; there was the only place where his partner could be deceived. <br>
    <sup>21</sup> Hoping to obstruct the enemy's only opportunity, he advanced in the direction of the test site. His heart pounded when he contemplated the cup of the forbidden tree in the distance. With the snake in her arms, Eva questioned her about many things. He marveled at the perception that the snake was overwhelming her greatly in knowledge. Full of curiosity, she asked the snake: - Where is the source of your great knowledge? Answer me, because I want to own it too. - Without wasting time, Satan, pointing to the tree of science of good and evil, replied: - there is the source of all my knowledge. - <br>
    <sup>22</sup> He then told him a liar story: he said he was a snake like the others, eating the fruits of paradise. Tasting a certain day of that forbidden fruit, he received, as if by charm, all the virtues. Looking towards the tree of science of good and evil, Eva was surprised and confused. Would the Creator deprive in his love something so good to his creatures ?! Seeing her surprised, Satan asked: - Is it so that God said: You shall not eat of all the trees in the garden? - Eva, restless, replied: - From the fruits of the garden trees we eat, more of the fruit of that tree that you claim to be a source of wisdom, God said: "You shall not eat of it, so that you do not die." - The snake in disdainful tone said: "That is false." If so, I would have died. <br>
    <sup>23</sup> Certainly the Eternal forbade them to eat from that tree to prevent man from receiving like Him, knowing all things. - The seductive words of the snake caused confusion in Eva's mind. Who would you trust? He had in mind the memory of the Creator's order and his sentence, but at the same time he had before him a palpable proof that contradicted Him. Dazed, she began to doubt the character of the Eternal. In a challenge, the snake picked fruits from the forbidden tree and began to savor them. <br>
    <sup>24</sup> Placing a fruit in the woman's hands, he encouraged her to eat, saying: - Didn't the Eternal say that if someone touched that fruit he would die? - A complete silence reigned over the Universe. On every inhabited planet, the children of light watched helplessly that distressing scene. Their future was at stake. In Jerusalem there was great commotion. Powerful angels appeared before the Creator, requesting permission to unmask the cowardly enemy, hidden in that snake. The Eternal, however, prevented them from doing so. If the use of force were the solution, I would have already applied it. <br>
    <sup>25</sup> They should respect the free will granted to man, and he may manifest his choice under the temptation of the enemy. The children of the light suffered immensely when they saw the woman doubting the One who had kindly given them life and the opportunity to reign in that paradise. How could I doubt who gave them so much love ?! Adam, who, in a strong hope of securing the cherished victory, hurried in his run, stared into the distance at his beloved, sitting by the tree of evidence. <br>
    <sup>26</sup> What was Eva doing in that dangerous place ?! A horrible feeling came upon him, once again remembering the warnings received, but he tried to banish him with the thought that he would reach his wife before any evil occurred to her. Eva hesitated in her conviction as she contemplated the fruit in her hands. For a few moments the future seemed bleak and frightening, but he overcame that feeling, thinking of the glories that he would conquer by eating that fruit. Still somewhat hesitant, he slowly raised his hands until he touched the fruit with his lips. <br>
    <sup>27</sup> The subjects of the kingdom of the light, shuddering, bowed in great terror. It seemed almost impossible, at that moment, for the woman to go back. While pale the faithful inquired about a possible hope, they witnessed with horror the terrible decision of Eve: She had resolved to break forever with the Creator, becoming captive of death. The Eternal, who in silent pain contemplated that scene of rebellion, bowed his forehead with his face bathed in tears. <br>
    <sup>28</sup> I couldn't bear the pain of that separation. The faithful, who in panic believed themselves defeated, were aware that not everything was lost. If Adam resisted temptation, remaining faithful to the Eternal, he would seal the great victory. Eve, who had been the victim of a hoax, could be aware of her mistake, being favored with divine forgiveness. When Adam in his anguished run reached the test site, it was too late. Sitting by the river, Eva casually savored the forbidden fruit. <br>
    <sup>29</sup> Adam shivered. Would it be the same fruit of the test? In a gesture of hope he looked at the tree of science of good and evil, but in tears he recognized the sad condemnation. Full of sadness, he looked at his wife, but found no words to wake her from the bitter reality. In complete despair, he raised his voice in a painful exclamation: "Eva, Eva, what are you doing?" By eating the forbidden fruit, the woman was taken by emotions that made her imagine having reached a higher sphere of life. Hearing the voice of her husband, still taken by illusory emotions, she raised her forehead stamping a smile, but was surprised to see him crying. <br>
    <sup>30</sup> With deep bitterness, Adam sought to know the reason that had led him to rebel against the Eternal. Eva, promptly, began to tell her the fantastic story of the wise snake. Satan knew that snake story would never convince man to eat the fruit of the forbidden tree. He needed to find a subtle way to take him to seal his lot by following in his wife's footsteps. Having Eva under his power, he resolved to make her the tempting object. I would wait for the right moment to link it. On the day you eat of him, you will certainly die. The memory of this sentence left Adam very distressed. <br>
    <sup>31</sup> The expectation of seeing his beloved dying in his arms was too much to bear. This affliction, however, was diminishing, seeing that she remained happy and affectionate at her side, as if no evil had happened to her. Relieved, Adam smiled again, corresponding to the affections of his companion. He surrendered to the sweetest emotions, far from knowing that it was the enemy who wrapped him in those hugs. At that moment of enchantment, Eva began talking about her experience with the science of good and evil. <br>
    <sup>32</sup> He told him about the treasures of wisdom that had been opened to him. In his new kingdom, he would live very happy. However, that happiness would be incomplete without the participation of her husband. He told her about the impossibility of going back in his steps, and insisted that he follow her. After telling her about his decision, Eva, with a sweet smile, extended her hands containing a fruit, asking him to eat it in a demonstration of his love for her. With the tempting voice in his ears, Adam sat on the grass in deep thought. <br>
    <sup>33</sup> His face turned pale again and his hands trembling. He was afraid to rebel against the Creator, but at the same time he understood that he would not be able to live apart from his companion, whom he loved with infinite love. Eve was the flesh of her flesh, the extension of her being. He felt distressed having to make such a serious decision. The paleness of Adam's face was reflected in the countenance of all the faithful to the Eternal. They heard the insinuation of the enemy and perceived with horror the hesitation of man. Adam's indecision left them desperate. <br>
    <sup>34</sup> If he obeyed Satan's proposal, all happiness would be eternally banished. In the decisions of the human being was the destiny of the entire Universe. Would he attend to Satan's request? After intense internal struggle, Adam looked at his companion; She had joined in promises of eternal surrender. I wouldn't leave her alone now. He would share with her the results of the rebellion. He then took a fruit from Eve's hand and, in a rash gesture, brought it to his mouth. <br>
    <sup>35</sup> Seeking to extinguish the voice of his conscience, which spoke of an eternal destruction, Adam threw himself into his wife's arms, enjoying the high price of his rebellion. Satan, with cries of triumph, left paradise, flying quickly with his innumerable hosts, who anxiously awaited the result of such a risky attempt. Upon learning of human misfortune, they joined in a thunderous party. They felt safe. Zion now belonged to them by right, being able there to establish an eternal kingdom, never being bothered by the laws of the Eternal. <br>
    <sup>36</sup> Throughout the Universe the children of light suffered and cried defeat. There has never been so much sadness and horror about the future. The voices that lived to sing praises to the Creator would now utter lamentations. The Eternal, who, overcome by infinite pain, had prostrated himself in tears at the fall of man, was not, however, surprised. Even before creating the Universe he had already foreseen that triumph of rebellion and, in His wisdom and love, had idealized a rescue plan that would involve him in an immense sacrifice. <br>
    <sup>37</sup> Drying the tears of His crying, He set out to act mightily in favor of His afflicted faithful, preventing them from falling into the hands of the enemies. In that mysterious intervention that apparently deposed against justice, the Eternal ordered His most powerful angels to immediately circumvent the garden of Eden, preventing Satan from taking possession of Mount Zion. Consoled before the divine manifestation, the powerful creatures, in prompt obedience, broke the infinite space, instantly surrounding paradise, in which the human being, already upset by sin, lived the blackness of a night that would be long and cruel. <br>
    <sup>38</sup> Being the authority of the Eternal based on justice, how could he justify His actions before the enemies? Had he not delivered the kingdom to man by His will, and he had not submitted it to Satan by free choice? While surprised the rational creatures considered the decisive actions of God, they heard His powerful voice that, reverberating throughout the creation, brought the revelation of the great mystery - revelation so wonderful that from that moment, for all eternity, it would occupy the mind of the faithful, being the subject for the sweetest meditations. - <br>
    <sup>39</sup> The Eternal spoke first about the terrible condemnation that hung over man and all creation. He said that by detaching himself from the Source of Life, man had plunged into such a deep abyss that he could not be reached by His arm of justice and power. Humiliated and tortured by the claws of the enemy, there was no other man left beyond death — painful fruit of his spontaneous rebellion. - Considering the human situation, the hosts of light saw no chance of triumph. They knew that only man could resume the enemy's dominance, returning it to the Creator. <br>
    <sup>40</sup> But the human being, eternally enslaved in his nature, would be incapable of such victory. In a melodious voice and full of tenderness, God revealed the plan of redemption, saying: "Truly, man will reap the fruit of his rebellion in a terrible death. I cannot, with my power, change his luck. If he acted like this, it would be unfair before my decree, but I will bring down all the condemnation on a Substitute that will arise in human descent, that Man will not bring into his hands the rings of death, being innocent and uncontaminated in His nature. <br>
    <sup>41</sup> As a representative of the human race, he will face Satan and overcome him. After triumphing in that battle, proving that love is stronger than selfishness, that truth is stronger than lies, that humility is more powerful than pride, the faithful Substitute will raise victorious hands not to greet the great conquers, but to take the cup of their condemnation from the hands of enslaved humanity. He will soak, submissively, the chalice of eternal death. <br>
    <sup>42</sup> That immense sacrifice will open to humans an opportunity to be redeemed, returning to the arms of the Creator, together with the lost dominion. "The hosts, surprised at the revelation of the Eternal, inquired into the identity of That Substitute. The Creator, with a loving smile, he told them: "I will be that Man. My Spirit will rest on a virgin, and in her a Holy Son will be begotten. That young man will be divine and human. In his humanity, he will be submissive to the divinity that will dwell in Him. The redeemed will see in Him the Father of Eternity, the Creator and Redeemer, the King of kings. His name will be Yoshua (Hebrew name that translated means the Eternal Savior.) "Assuming human nature, God could pay the high price of ransom, dying instead of sinners. <br>
    <sup>43</sup> The hosts of light fell silent upon knowing the plan of the Creator. The thought of seeing Him submit to such a painful sacrifice, in order to redeem the lost dominion, was too much to bear. There was, however, no other hope of victory, except through that loving surrender. After enjoying the high price of sin, the young couple felt bad. Initially they felt a great emptiness in the heart, which was then filled by remorse and sadness. They perceived that, inspired by greed, they had sealed their sad luck and that of all creation. They seemed to hear in the distance the groan of a defeated Universe. <br>
    <sup>44</sup> The sun, which had filled them with life and heat on that day, was hiding on the horizon, announcing a black night. The tree, which had previously announced the happy encounter with the Creator, seemed to involve them in a sentence that they would never wake up to a new day. They dared not even look towards the top, afraid to see the ray of judgment fall on them that would reduce them to dust. With his eyes directed to the cold ground, the sentence came to mind: "On the day you eat of him, you will surely die." Desperate tears rolled down their faces as they awaited the tragic end. When considering the reason for his rebellion, Adam began to recriminate his wife for having given ears to the snake. <br>
    <sup>45</sup> Eve, in turn, seeking to excuse herself, threw guilt on the Creator, saying: "Why did the Eternal allow the snake to deceive me ?!" The love that reigned in the human heart disappeared, giving rise to pride and selfishness, which melted into resentment and hatred. His nature was no longer pure and holy, but corrupted and full of rebellion. Everything was changed. Even the gentle breeze that had previously bathed them in refreshing caresses, now froze the guilty couple. <br>
    <sup>46</sup> The trees and flowery quarries, which were his delight, now consisted of obstacles when walking aimlessly on that night. Satan's purpose in filling the Sabbath of darkness seemed to have been fulfilled. On that night, there was not even the silver reflection of the moonlight to tell them of hope. The twinkling stars, suspended in the dark sky, were obfuscated by pain. The darkness of a long night of sin descended upon the world — shadows under which so many would crawl without the hope of a dawn. - It was high night already and the darkness seemed to wrap the sad couple in eternal shadows. <br>
    <sup>47</sup> They didn't even meditate on their few words, suffocated by the agony, of a dawn. Cabizbajos, groped from here to there, in the expectation of impending judgment, which would reduce them to the cold dust, forgotten under those endless darkness. Suddenly a glow appeared in the sky, which was increasing as it approached the earth. The couple shuddered, because they knew it was the Creator who came to give them the punishment. Overcome by panic, they ran, distancing themselves from Mount Zion, the place of shameful fall. Just there they saw the Creator go. They, who always ran to meet the loving Father, attracted by His light, now fled desperately in search of dark places, and dense forest. <br>
    <sup>48</sup> The Eternal, moved by infinite love, began to follow in the footsteps of the fugitive couple. As he walked, he cried when he remembered the happy moments he had spent with them in that paradise. How everything had transformed! His children could no longer see in Him a Father of love, but someone who, angry, sought to punish them. Moved by a strong yearning to embrace His human children, God made the voice reverberate in an inquiry: "Adam, where are you?" His voice, sounding in the darkness, brought only an empty echo that spoke of ingratitude and rebellion. <br>
    <sup>49</sup> As he wished to wrap the couple in an ardent embrace, and with words of affection confess that His love was the same! Seeing His children fleeing His presence, the Eternal was overwhelmed with great pain. Before His troubled look of tears, the future of the human race stretched. How many, deceived by Satan, would flee His presence during the long night of sin, judging in Him a tyrant Lord, who lives looking for faults and weaknesses in sinners, in order to punish them! The Creator, however, would not give up looking for them through the shady valleys of the kingdom of death, until they conquered a repentant people. Adam and Eve, exhausted by the hurried escape, hid through the foliage at the foot of a fig tree. <br>
    <sup>50</sup> Recognizing their nakedness, they tried to make aprons by sewing those sheets. Dressed like this, they thought they could get rid of the feeling of shame before the Creator. The Eternal, approaching the place where the couple was hiding, asked: - Adam, where are you? - Unable to hide more from God, Adam rose together with his companion and, crestfallen, appeared before the Creator, prostrating at his feet. They failed to face him anymore, due to the feeling of guilt. <br>
    <sup>51</sup> The Creator, affectionately, took them by the hands, lifting them from the ground, and, with an expression of sadness on the countenance, asked them: - Why did they flee from me? Did they eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? - Adam, all trembling, in a voice broken by sobs of fear, replied: - The woman you gave me as a companion, she gave me the fruit and I ate. - With this answer, Adam sought to excuse himself, throwing the blame on his wife. <br>
    <sup>52</sup> Turning to Eva, the Eternal asked him: "Why did you do that?" Eva promptly replied: "That snake deceived me and I ate." - Both did not want to acknowledge the blame, throwing it on others. Simply put, they attributed responsibility to the Creator for all the wrongdoing: "Why had he granted them free will? Why had he created the woman? Why had he created the snake?" Silent, God watched His children who, shy and bewildered, stood before Him. <br>
    <sup>53</sup> With deep sadness, He foresaw that this would be the experience of countless human beings in the course of history. How many would be lost for not recognizing one's own fault! How many would try to justify themselves, throwing their mistakes on others and even on the Creator himself! With soft words, the Eternal tried to make them acknowledge their guilt. Only by recognizing their need, could they be helped. Looking at the fragile garments woven by sinful hands, he said to the couple, "Children, those garments are insufficient, immediately drying up they will fall apart." You need lasting garments that can cover your nakedness, freeing you from condemnation. If you would like, I can give you that garment. - <br>
    <sup>54</sup> In the face of the Creator's kind words, which brought hope, the couple prostrated themselves repentantly, detaching themselves from their illusory garments, symbols of their failure. They now longed for the garments of salvation, promised by the divine Father.

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">God reveals the effects of the fall and the Plan of Redemption. The painful sacrifice of the lamb, a symbol of the Savior. The promised garments are provided. The Creator will be the Man who will save them. In the couple intensifies the love and gratitude towards the Savior, the shudder of the evil hosts before the intervention of the Eternal and the revelation of the Rescue Plan The Eternal accompanies the couple outside the garden Satan tries again to seize the human being facing them with fury, but is repelled by God, and their silenced threats Bad consequences of the science of good and evil The faith of man in the revealed truths of redemption The Eternal, companion of the human being in his journey on the earth Nature of the Creator with respect to war. uplifting work counterattacks many attacks from Satan Revelations received when building the altar Two worlds reflected in fallen nature An immaculate lamb guided and prepared by Di In the sacrifice a representation of the conflict between good and evil is shown. The burning flame, symbol of divine forgiveness. Nature, even in its fallen state, reveals the Plan of Redemption.</p>

 <p>
    <sup>1</sup> After contemplating His children who, repentant, lay at His feet, the Eternal took them affectionately by the hands and lifted them. He was glad to reveal to the fallen man the plan of redemption. With tenderness, God began to discover to them first the bitter results of his fall, saying: "Children, you sealed the destiny of all creation in the grip of death. Disharmony already penetrates nature, trying to destroy in it all the virtues. <br>
    <sup>2</sup> The abyss in which you immersed yourself in disobedience is also deep so that you can be reached by my powerful arm. Thus, detached from the Source of Life, there is no other human being left beyond death. "After uttering these words that revealed a sad fate, the Eternal invited the couple to follow him. Cabizbajos, Adam and Eve , in tears, they followed the Creator in His steps of justice, which led them to the place of the shameful fall, where they supposed to find the painful end. <br>
    <sup>3</sup> On that painful walk, they sobbed when they remembered their past of glory undone by ingratitude. How the terrible expectation of being reduced, along with the creation, to cold ashes under the darkness of that night of sin hurt in their soul! As they walked, they contemplated through the tears the numb beauty bathed in the light of God. They saw the innocent animals, who were not aware of the great pain. Suddenly, the couple stopped, overcome by intense crying; his faltering steps had led them to a lamb, the dearest animal. <br>
    <sup>4</sup> Would your eyes of sweetness also go out ?! Drying their tears, the Eternal ordered them to take the innocent lamb in their arms. Wrapping it next to his chest, they silently accompanied the steps of the Creator, until they reached the top of Mount Zion, place of the shameful fall. Contemplating the remains of the fruit there, with impetus the memory of the divine judgment came to mind: "On the day you eat of it, you will surely die." The terrible moment had arrived. The guilty man should drink the bitter chalice of death, succumbing hopelessly. <br>
    <sup>5</sup> Aware of their downfall, the couple perceived, in horror, that the hands they had brought to life now held a pointed stone knife. Trembling, they prostrated themselves and waited for compliance with the just sentence. While silenced by fear, Adam and Eve waited for the blow that would reduce them to dust, they felt the soft touch of the divine hands that lifted them into a new life. The condemnation, however, would fall on a substitute. <br>
    <sup>6</sup> Placing the knife in Adam's hands, the Creator said to him: "The lamb will die instead of you." - Adam should sacrifice it. Frightened at the command of God, the couple, crying, began to cry: - Lord, the little lamb is not innocent! - With an expression of justice, the Eternal added: - If he does not die, you can not have the clothes of which I spoke. - At the insistence of the Creator, Adam, all trembling, in a painful effort, stuck that sharp stone in the little lamb's chest. The blow was fatal, and the little animal, shedding its precious blood, plunged into the darkness of an endless night. <br>
    <sup>7</sup> Contemplating the inert lamb on the bloody grass, the couple raised their voices and wept. They were beginning to understand the enormity of their tragedy. How terrible was death! She, in his possession, had turned off all the light in the eyes of the innocent animal. Leaning silently on the inert body of the lamb, the Eternal removed the skin covered with white wool and with it made robes to cover the nakedness of the couple. After dressing them he asked them with affection: - Did you understand the meaning of all this? - In deep reflection, through sobs of recognition and gratitude, the couple exclaimed: - He died in our place, to give us his clothes! - <br>
    <sup>8</sup> Adam and Eve, although they had understood that physical reality, were far from understanding the meaning of that event. To them the Creator would reveal the mystery of divine love. With an expression of infinite mercy, God began to reveal to the human being the meaning of that painful sacrifice, saying: The innocent little lamb, which today suffered, symbolizes a man to be born. In his eyes there will be the same tenderness, the same love. Coated for a just life, like the white wool that covered the lamb, that man will grow like a renewal on Earth, not holding the bonds of sin in his hands. In his appearance, that man will not bring the pomp of a king, so he will be despised by many. <br>
    <sup>9</sup> He will be a man of pain, for the weight of all provocations will fall upon him. In his faithfulness to the kingdom of light, that man will fight the usurper enemy, finally defeating him. After triumphing in his struggles, he will take upon himself the burden of your condemnation that will cause him a terrible death. He will be pierced because of your rebellion and crushed by your iniquities. He will be oppressed and humiliated, but he will not open his mouth, like the little lamb that today gave himself peacefully. Succumbing in death, he will grant you the merits of his victory. Wrapped in their garments of justice, you will be free from condemnation. <br>
    <sup>10</sup> Eternal life you will achieve in this way, by the sacrifice of that righteous man who will be born. Adam and Eve, who in a mixture of gratitude and pain heard the revelation of such a great salvation, inquired reverently about that special man who in his offspring would have to arise, in order to fulfill such an immense sacrifice. The Creator, looking at them tenderly, moved by a love that overcomes the same death, enveloped them in an affectionate embrace and revealed: - I will be that Man! - Surprised at the declaration of the Eternal, Adam and Eve were motionless, while contemplating His Tender countenance. <br>
    <sup>11</sup> Understanding the meaning of the tremendous sacrifice, they prostrated themselves at His feet and with tears cried out: - We are deserving of death Lord, but You are innocent and must not suffer in our place! - Wiping away the tears, the Eternal with tenderness He spoke: "My children, I love you with an eternal love." I will die instead of you. - Given this confirmation, the couple raised their voice in a painful lamentation. They said: - We kill the Creator! We kill the Creator! ”But God began to comfort the couple with words of hope, saying:“ After drinking the chalice of eternal death, I will resume life and go up to heaven. <br>
    <sup>12</sup> I will intercede there for the lost man, granting to all those who, repentant, accept my sacrifice, the garments of my victory. Together, we will finally triumph over the kingdom of sin that will fall into ashes under our feet. I will then create a new Heaven and a new Earth, where only justice and love will reign. We will live like this forever, in a kingdom of perfect harmony and peace. - The Creator, who accompanied by the couple was still on Mount Zion, concluded His revelations by saying: <br>
    <sup>13</sup> "The garden of Eden will now be empty. The human being, during the long night of sin, will wander in his exile. He will not walk, however, alone: ​​the Eternal, also a pilgrim, will tread with man all the thorny path, until being able to climb up the lost mountain together, triumphantly triumphing over the kingdom of death.The tree of the science of good and evil monument of rebellion will then be undone, giving rise to a glorious tree that, joining its crown to the tree of life , it will become the memorial arch of the great victory. On the holy mountain redeemed, then the universal throne will rest forever, which by the triumphant faithful will be called: the throne of God and the Lamb. " <br>
    <sup>14</sup> Adam and his companion, after hearing such comforting and hopeful words, raised their voices in a song of gratitude and praise. They now knew the infinite love of their Creator and were willing to serve it. After comforting the couple, God led them out of Eden. It was not easy for them to say goodbye to that beautiful home; there they had awakened to life in the arms of the Eternal; there they enjoyed moments of pure happiness, in the company of the Creator, the angels and the docile animals. An infinite nostalgia seemed to involve the couple in their abandonment steps. It was with horror that Satan and his subjects witnessed the intervention of the Eternal. <br>
    <sup>15</sup> They were shaken at the surprising revelation of the rescue plan. With rabid frustration, they understood that, if indeed the divine promise was fulfilled, there would be no hope. After considering everything that had happened, great anger took hold of his heart. He was not willing to recognize the redemption of the human being. He would make every effort to retain him, together with the kingdom that had been delivered to him. When the couple, accompanied by the Creator, reached the valley wounded by death, it dawned. There Satan confronted them with fury, in an attempt to seize the human being again. <br>
    <sup>16</sup> The couple was trembling on the face of the enemy, but God's protective hands calmed them. Expressing in the countenance the firmness of a justice that is eternal, the Eternal silenced the threats of the enemy with the following words: "The human being belongs to me, because I bought it with my blood." As they walked silently beside the Creator, Adam and Eve watched with sadness the signs of death stamped on that nature before so full of life. The beautiful flowers, which had unbuttoned to exhale eternal aromas, now hung withered; The little birds, who happily greeted them at each dawn with their trills, now flew distant, sounding such sad songs! Everything was changed in nature. <br>
    <sup>17</sup> The science of good and evil had brought no good to the Universe, but an intense spiritual and physical conflict. Faced with the devastating consequences of his fall, the couple, defeated by an inexpressible sadness, prostrated themselves and cried bitterly. God, who was also saddened by pain, contemplated the bleak stage, sought, with words of hope, to comfort them. He told them about the new Heaven and the new Earth that one day would create, where peace and love would reign in each heart. There they would always live together, not bringing on the forehead the marks of sadness, but crowns of eternal victory. <br>
    <sup>18</sup> There he would dry the tears on their faces and they would never wet his eyes again. Protecting Adam and Eve in their steps, the Creator led them through a wounded valley, until they reached the foot of a hill. They climbed it in slow steps, while exchanging words of encouragement and hope. His feet finally reached the soft grass that covered the spacious top of that hill. It was on that place that the couple saw each day the sun decline, bathing the sky and valleys a bright red, like the blood that had dripped from the lamb's chest. <br>
    <sup>19</sup> Turning to the eastern side, the couple, in a mixture of pain and nostalgia, contemplated in the distance the landscapes that enveloped them in that happy past. When they saw Mount Zion, which stood majestically in the middle of Eden, they cried when they remembered the fall. How weak they had been! The sun was declining in his day, announcing the arrival of one more sad night - the first out of paradise.— In a calm gesture, the Eternal, showing them the outstanding valley of the hill, spoke to them with affection: "Here will be your temporary abode From here you can contemplate the paradise that for some time will remain on Earth, until it is collected to its place of origin, within the Celestial Jerusalem. <br>
    <sup>20</sup> There, protected by justice, await the dawn of victory. When that great day arrives, we will return together to Zion, where we will be crowned in glory, in a kingdom of eternal happiness and peace. "After saying these words, God commanded the couple to build an altar of stones there, on the which every week, on the night before Saturday, they should immolate a lamb, in memory of His Sacrifice. <br>
    <sup>21</sup> As a sign of His presence, and for the certainty that his sins would be forgiven, He would light a fire on the altar, which would last all night, until he completely consumed the sacrifice offering. For the human being to be able to affirm his faith about the revealed truths, and not in the visible manifestation of the person of the Creator, He would remain invisible from that moment onwards. Only on special occasions, when His appearance or that of angels became necessary for new revelations and warnings, would this occur. Contemplating His children saddened at that moment when they would be left apparently alone. <br>
    <sup>22</sup> The Eternal said to them with love: "Children, even if you have to remain in this hostile environment, you do not need to fear, for I will remain by your side. I will be a fellow friend on this journey; I will carry your pains on your shoulders, your desires. , your struggles. When, tempted by the enemy, they were about to give in, they will be able to find shelter in my arms, which will always be extended to save them and, if one day you will not resist, and by the fury of the enemy you will be dragged into the depths from the abyss, do not despair, believing you have no hope, for I will be there to meet you with my forgiveness and strength. <br>
    <sup>23</sup> Always keep in mind the meaning of the garments received from my hands, for they speak of the redemption that man belongs to. Rest my children, in my arms of love. "After comforting the couple with these promises, the Creator, seeing that they were sleepy by fatigue, made them rest in His lap and, as usual, gently caressed them to numb them. Seeing them forgotten in their sleep, God wept as they foresaw the suffering they would experience upon awakening.With their hearts broken by the pain caused by that physical separation, the Creator left the couple asleep on the grass, after kissing the faces already marked by the suffering. <br>
    <sup>24</sup> His light dissipated by becoming invisible, giving rise to the darkness of that first night out of paradise. In the subconscious of the couple began to parade colorful dreams of a happy past. The beauties of Eden were once again in the middle, filled with eternal joy. Grateful for life, they ran through the flowery fields, playing with animals. Happily joined the voices to the angels in the harmonious songs in praise of the Creator. So many beautiful scenes paraded in his subconscious, but those dreams became nightmares, making them relive their tragedy. <br>
    <sup>25</sup> Agonizers woke up in the darkness of that first night in exile. Failing to fall asleep, the couple remained in tears until they were comforted by the dawn that revealed to them in the distance the nostalgic paradise. God, although invisible, remained next to Adam and Eve there on the hill. Their suffering was His suffering, as well as the hope that one day they would return victorious to Zion. Before the contemplative gaze of the Creator, the bleak future of humanity was revealed. With regret, I saw countless creatures perishing without salvation, for rejecting His love. Tears wet His face, foreseeing the enemy using all cunning in order to retain human beings under his domain. <br>
    <sup>26</sup> Long would be the night of sin, and the battle for the reconquest of the lost kingdom was at odds. The triumph of the light would require from God an immense sacrifice. In the person of the Messiah, in his time, he would be born among men, with the mission of paying the ransom price. Through Him many would be freed from the claws of the enemy: all those who accepted Him as Savior and King. Against those chosen, the enemy would attack all the forces trying to make them fall. In his vision of the future, the Creator contemplated with joy the final triumph of the redeemed. <br>
    <sup>27</sup> They had been extremely tested, but in everything they were more than conquerors through Him who redeemed them from darkness into the kingdom of light. After anticipating the sufferings that would result from the great struggle, the Eternal extended his gaze across the captive plains, contemplating there the rebel hosts willing to fight. The aim of these armies was to seize the human being again, in which the right of dominion over the Universe was sealed. Contrary to the nature of the Creator is war, but for the defense of His children, he was willing to use His power. <br>
    <sup>28</sup> His strength, however, would only be used fairly. If the human being rejected that protection offered by the sacrifice of the Messiah, God could do nothing to prevent himself from perishing in the grip of the enemy. Adam and Eve, however, had repented of their great sin, receiving by the mercy of God garments of salvation, symbolized by the skins of the sacrificed lamb. Justified by the delivery of the couple, the Eternal summoned His powerful armies for the fight. In prompt obedience the hosts of light stormed the outer space in the direction of the Earth, surrounding which strong wall the hill, bearer of that treasure redeemed by the blood of the divine King. <br>
    <sup>29</sup> The human being was given a duty in Eden to take care of nature: they prepared quarries for flowers; they reaped fruits for support; They directed the animals in their innocent life, training them to be useful. These occupations had been for them sources of development and pleasure. Now, despite the adversities, they should continue to perform that duty. The work itself, carried out according to the Creator's orders, would already cancel out many enemy attacks. The couple's first occupations on that morning brought revelations of God's great love, hitherto unknown. <br>
    <sup>30</sup> As they gathered the stones for the construction of the altar, they experienced the pain of wounds that dripped blood, as well as the fatigue that caused sweat to emanate. Feeling and contemplating everything in their own flesh, they loved the Savior more, for whom the built altar foreshadowed greater wounds, which would shed all His blood, as well as fatigue that would undermine all the sage of His life. The look of nostalgia and hope of the couple from now on would never perch on distant Eden, without first discerning the altar of sacrifice. <br>
    <sup>31</sup> That altar, with its stains of sweat and blood, would remain as a remembrance of pain and suffering that, after moistening the lips of human beings, would transship into the Creator's cup. After contemplating for a long time the paradise of eternal life that extended far beyond that dark altar of death, the couple experienced the sweet relief of rest. Eager to know the landscapes of their new home, Adam and Eve, encouraged by hope, went for a walk. <br>
    <sup>32</sup> Their steps led them along the paths of smiles and tears; of charms and disappointments; of delicate flowers unbuttoned, bathed in perfume, and of flowers, lying withered and odorless; of still docile and submissive animals and of enemy, fierce and menacing animals. The couple discerned in their walk the currencies of two worlds: that of light and that of darkness; of love and selfishness; of hope and despair; of harmony and disharmony; of life and death. That vision filled them with sadness and they cried long. That sadness would increase even more in the future, when they discovered the depth of those currencies within their offspring. <br>
    <sup>33</sup> Six trees had already colored the skies announcing to the couple the dark and cold nights that with their cloak of darkness undid all the living images, except the hope of seeing them colorful again in the dawn of light. The hour of sacrifice was approaching, when the rude altar, scorched in his justice would cry for blood. If they did not offer the offering, it would explode with certainty, wrapping the whole world with its flames; There would be no dawn then, no hope of Eden to flourish. <br>
    <sup>34</sup> How precious is the blood! Blood is life; life is light! For a being that night would become eternal, without dawn! That being should take the blame of everyone, giving his blood to the rude altar. Who would offer? Who would pour the sage of life, until he saw the last flash go out in his sky ?! Adam and Eve after reflecting for a long time, contemplating the cradle of death built by their hands, looked at each other restlessly with that decisive question: Who will offer? That inquiry, born of his guilt, made the voice of the blessed Creator vibrate deep within his remembrances in His revelation of infinite goodness: - “I love you with an eternal love; I will die in your place ". - <br>
    <sup>35</sup> Grateful, the couple bowed reverently before the thirsty altar, seeing it by faith, satiated by the gift of eternal love. On that afternoon of the sixth day, God subjected the human being to a tremendous test of faith. They had before them the altar of stones, built according to the divine order, but there was no sheep for the sacrifice. In their yearning, they remembered Eden, where there were many flocks. When they saw the sun fall on the horizon, Adam and Eve began to cry out to God for help, because they knew that only a miracle could provide them, at that last moment, a lamb for sacrifice. <br>
    <sup>36</sup> In the eyes of the inhabitants of the Universe, the great miracle for which the human being cried out, was already processed for almost a week: Guided by the Creator, an immaculate lamb had left Eden and followed the couple's traces in their walk to exile. In his long day, that little animal had to face many challenges and dangers, more protected and guided by the Eternal he continued in his mission. When the shadows of the dusk began to wrap the hill, the couple who lived such a hard test of faith, discerned a little white dot that jumped on the grass coming towards them. As he approached, that lump seemed to speak of hope, of life and heat. <br>
    <sup>37</sup> Seeing that the great miracle had happened, they ran to meet the lamb, wrapping it in his arms. He was tired, but he would not rest: he would rest. He was thirsty, but he would not drink: he would drink the altar that cried out for blood. That lamb had the will to live in the arms of man, but he would die, so that he could live in the arms of God. It was a perfect symbolism of the Redeemer who would leave His glory, coming in search of the sinner. The darkness of one more prefigurative night slowly descended, enveloping all nature in his prison. <br>
    <sup>38</sup> His strength, however, would be struck down before the human being, by the brightness of a special fire, ignited by the hands of divine forgiveness upon the lifeless body of the innocent lamb. Everything was prepared for the painful blow: an act that would extinguish from those sweet eyes the last flash of life, immersing them in the cold darkness of an eternal night: darkness that would generate light; cold that would generate heat; death that would generate life - undeserved gifts; - fruits of divine love offered to sinful hands, ready to hurt. In the middle of the silent night the altar cries out; The sad man exclaims, while the mute lamb does not claim to be extended for death. The hands that built the altar rise now, not to caress as before, but to hurt, bleeding the price of forgiveness. <br>
    <sup>39</sup> Just a gesture, nothing more, and the flash will go out forever from innocent eyes, making the light of salvation shine on the guilty face. Adam, trembling doubt in compassion. In the meek and submissive lamb, ready to die instead, go to the promised Savior. With a regretful heart, in a painful effort, he digs the stone knife into the chest of the animal that perishes in his hands without even giving a groan. The power of the night is immediately struck down by the brightness of the fire of acceptance. Its light reveals to the human being its tragic condition: Seeing the hands stained by innocent blood, the couple feels guilty for that death. <br>
    <sup>40</sup> In tears they kneel before the altar that no longer demands blood from them, but offers light, accepting the unmerited forgiveness. Rising, the couple contemplates the poorly wounded body of the poor little lamb, unable to thank him for the wealth granted in exchange for his so rough blow. Bathed in the soft light of sacrifice, Adam and his companion remain silent to meditate, until they are overcome by a deep sleep. Reclining on the ground covered with soft grass, they gently fall asleep under the warm rays of forgiveness, certain that their brightness and heat would last until they were the darkness of that Saturday completely vanished by the shining sun. <br>
    <sup>41</sup> The light of the lamb, since it was lit on the altar that night, remained in constant war with darkness. On several occasions it grew in brightness, chasing away the cold darkness in the distance, bathing nature with its rays of life. Sometimes, the darkness bringing its cold wind almost completely tore the flame. This, however, in a great effort fed on the blood of the lamb, throwing its burning flame high, flooding everything around it with light and heat. <br>
    <sup>42</sup> The conflict between the light born of sacrifice and darkness on that night, discovered to the faithful of the Universe many important lessons - truths that would occupy their minds for all eternity. - In that flame, whether it was burning in its brightness, whether it was whipped by the winds of the night, the faithful saw a representation of the millennial conflict between good and evil; conflict that truce would extend until the eternal dawn. The Eternal, in pledge of His future sacrifice, had lit in the midst of darkness, the light of truth, and that would be kept burning in the heart of the human being, by virtue of His blood that would be shed for remission of guilt. <br>
    <sup>43</sup> Against that light, the enemy would lash out all the cold winds of evil, banishing its sweet glow from the hearts of many. How many would be lost by rejecting the light of divine forgiveness, being enveloped by the darkness of the dark night! After long hours of combat, the signs of dawn arise in the sky. The darkness that with anger had thrown its winds over the flame that does not die trying to banish it, becomes confused at the signs of dawn. The sky dyed a bright red, reminds us of the blood that had sprouted from the breast of the lamb so that the flame of forgiveness could illuminate human night. <br>
    <sup>44</sup> In the midst of the colorful of blood, the shining sun rises on the horizon, bringing in its warm rays the taste of victory, enveloping everything with its life. The dawn in his nostalgic affection, caresses the distant paradise, taking from his beloved bosom in his morning breeze the scent of nostalgia, in a message of comfort and hope for the suffering creatures of the valley of death. Bathed in the warm rays and the breeze of hope, the couple awakens on another Saturday, whose symbolism points to rest in the kingdom of God, at the end of the great conflict between light and darkness. <br>
    <sup>45</sup> Beyond that altar covered with ashes, Adam and Eve contemplate the nostalgic paradise. Although distant in their exile, they rejoice with the certainty that the sacrifice of the Messiah will scratch for them on Saturday of Saturdays: that of tears forever banished; from sun always to shine in a clear sky; from lambs always alive to play on the grass; day without dusk, when there will be no more altar covered with blood and ashes. They sigh for that day of glory, when God will become eternally visible, holding in their hands the marks of His infinite love for His children. <br>
    <sup>46</sup> Before the fall, the human being, as well as all the heavenly hosts, learned at the feet of the Creator who patiently taught them the treasures of wisdom contained in the vast compendium of nature. Everything in the Universe, from the tiny atom to the largest of the worlds, testified in its perfect existence of the character of the divine King. Many teachings, however, remained hidden in the pages of that great book in the period that preceded the fall: They were like the stars that, hidden during the day, reveal their brightness as the shadows of the night come down. <br>
    <sup>47</sup> Having captive nature, the enemy, in an attempt to block the revelation of Eternal wisdom, introduced in it spots of selfishness, destruction, unhappiness and death. I did not know that these spots would show in the face of creation the depth of God's justice and love, leading the faithful to love and revere him even more. For the couple, as well as for all the children of light, the wounded nature broke their veil, revealing new aspects of the Creator's goodness hidden until then. <br>
    <sup>48</sup> Adam and Eve who were accustomed to the eternal flowers in paradise, those who did not see them unbuttoned, now saw them emerge in tender buttons, amid the threats of thorns ready to hurt them. These tender flowers, regardless of being with the thorns, exhaled soft perfumes of praise and gratitude, never getting tired of pleasing the environment. When whipped by the cold winds of the night, those flowers did not resent, but offered their scent, which transformed the fury of the winds into scented breezes of a dawn. <br>
    <sup>49</sup> Moved by deep gratitude, the couple closely accompanied the ministry of love of those flowers that they never tired of blessing, offering their beauty and perfume as relief for those who were hurt by the harsh thorns. Those singular and pure flowers, after showing in their short life that forgiveness and love are stronger than all winds and thorns, in a last effort to communicate joy, exhaled their perfume, falling withered and lifeless on the cold ground . There, forgotten, they became insignificant dust that was dispersed by the wind. <br>
    <sup>50</sup> The death of the flowers, although it seemed to be a failure, revealed to the couple the mystery of the rebirth of life: By dying, the flowers gave life to the fruits that, in turn, after serving as food, donated their seeds full of life . In the death of these seeds, the miracle of life was reborn, multiplying the trees with their flowers ready to repeat the teaching of love and sacrifice. Nature, therefore, even stained by sin, revealed the hidden mystery of the plan of redemption. Each flower to unbutton in the middle of the thorns, in its short life of love, was a symbol of the Savior that would be born among the thorns of evil, to comfort the perfume of the heart of the afflicted. <br>
    <sup>51</sup> Similar to the flower, the Messiah after proving that love and forgiveness are stronger than all winds of hate; that the truth and justice of the kingdom of God are greater than all the deceptions and injustices of the kingdom of the enemy, would shed the sage of his life, dying to redeem the guilty.

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Adam and Eve dedicated to edifying work. The hill became a miniature of Eden. Protection and divine care. Experiences in obeying the commandment on sacrifice. The cunning trap of the enemy, looking at the symbols of sacrifice as bearers of forgiveness and life Adam and Eve offer sacrifices to the Lord, the Eternal manifests them by consoling them and preventing them from danger Promise of the birth of their firstborn Responsibilities towards their son Birth of Cain Birth of Cain reminds them of the promise of the future birth of the Messiah The rebellious childhood of Cain The enemy mocks the suffering of God and His faithful and tries to make God give up his plan of redemption The Eternal affirms His solemn promise Adam and Eve make sacrifices and pray for their son, the Eternal The Eternal reveals himself to Cain and tells him the story of Lucifer and the Sun. Promise of the birth of Abel. Cain, like Lucifer, is dragged by r his pride to a false illusion. God would seek all forms in order to save Cain</p>

 <p>
    <sup>1</sup> Consoled by the revelations of nature, Adam and his companion, students in the school of suffering, learned each day to love the Savior more. They grew in wisdom, humility and holiness. All the virtues destroyed by sin were reborn in the heart. With enthusiasm, the couple dedicated themselves to edifying work: they planted gardens that, by the power of God, were filled with scented flowers and delicious fruits. His home in exile became a refuge for the persecuted animals of the valleys. The hill, under the protection of the angels of light, became a miniature of distant Eden. Among the animals gathered and tamed with love, there were many sheep. <br>
    2<sup> </sup>Adam and Eve could not put their eyes on those docile animals destined for sacrifice, without tasting a mixture of pain and gratitude deep within the soul. On the night before each Sabbath, Adam had, by order of the Creator, repeating the painful act. How much bitterness and regret came over the couple as the darkness of the night of sacrifice descended! How much comfort the flame of forgiveness brought to them that had never ceased to shine on the altar, on those pre-figurative nights! The decisive value of the sacrifice, so that life could flourish under divine protection, led the couple to immensely value their little flock. <br>
    <sup>3</sup> Every sixth day, however, he began to bring with him, beyond pain, a restlessness: - Who will donate his blood to the altar when the last sheep perishes? - In the eyes of the marveled couple, the miracle of the love, renewing the hope of living other weeks under the brightness of the flame of forgiveness: a sheep, the fattest of them, began to bleed as if in sacrifice; From their pain, they were born four little lambs. Filled with joy and gratitude, Adam and Eve prostrated themselves before the invisible Savior, holding in their hands those new creatures that brought in their eyes the same tenderness and willingness to sacrifice. <br>
    <sup>4</sup> Sure that new miracles would multiply their days, the couple united their voice as before, in a song of gratitude and adoration to the Creator who, like the lambs would also be born of pain to fulfill in his life the greatest of all sacrifices, for the Salvation of humanity. The Eternal, although invisible in the eyes of His human children, remained very close, accompanied by an army of angels, in a tireless ministry of care and protection. The couple was unaware that the sweet calm and peace reigning on that hill, as well as all their prosperity, were the fruits of such an intense struggle. <br>
    <sup>5</sup> If their eyes were open to the scenes that were invisible, they would be snatched away from horror; How terrible was the enemy and his hosts in their constant vested with the purpose of ruining the human being, snatching it from the hands of the Creator! Seeing that the use of force would not result in victory, the enemy in his cunning idealized a trap with which he could link the couple. Gathering his armies, he revealed his plans by saying: - “The human being was ordered to sacrifice lambs, as symbols of the coming Savior. <br>
    <sup>6</sup> We will tempt you to look at those symbols as bearers of forgiveness and life, gradually making you forget the reality of the sacrifice promised by God. It will be a slow process, but of a sure victory. "- The Creator, knowing the danger of that trap, was sad, because when he looked to the future, he could see so many of His children being diverted from the path of salvation. How many would become attached? to the symbols judging to find virtue in them! God in their love and care, would not leave them unaware of the danger that threatened them. <br>
    <sup>7</sup> He knew how much Adam and his companion loved those lambs who, by dying on the altar, offered them light and heat. They could easily be induced to see them as sources of life and light, beginning to revere them. Many weeks had passed, bringing with them the nights of pain and sacrifice, followed by the days of hope and nostalgia of the loving Father, who after making promises and drying his tears, had become invisible before his eyes. Each day that passed, he brought the couple a new burden of nostalgia, making them inquire at each sunset: - When will we kiss His face again? When will we be wrapped in His arms, walking in the light of His love ?! - How nostalgic they felt of those Edenic nights, when they fell asleep in the soft lap of their divine Father! <br>
    <sup>8</sup> One more week of work and lessons learned was ending. The sun in its decline announced another night of regret and innocent blood to bathe the altar. The silent couple was far from imagining that on that night, the painful blow that was always followed by fire would reveal to them the blessed face of the Father. With trembling hands, Adam lifted the lamb that, mute, made no resistance when placed on the altar. Tears rolled down his face at the thought that one more innocent animal would dive into the hated darkness of death, to generate the light with his blood. <br>
    <sup>9</sup> It is painful to sacrifice, but there is no other way of salvation. Only through the spilled blood of the lamb can they live to contemplate in the future the face of the Father. In a painful effort Adam drops that pointed stone on the little lamb that spills his blood in a groan of pain. A glorious Light soon dissipates the darkness flooding the entire hill with its rays of life. Through the tears the couple then contemplates the Creator in the fire of the altar. In a gesture of love, God opens His arms as before, and with a smile he walks towards the long-awaited embrace. <br>
    <sup>10</sup> Without finding words that express their immense nostalgia, the couple throws themselves into His chest and cries bitterly. The divine Father, moved, also cries, but tries to comfort his children, with his sweet smile. With excitement the couple contemplates the face of the Father, wrapping her with kisses and affection. Their love for Him had been intensified by suffering. Grateful and happy, they walk beside the Creator, showing the gardens full of flowers and fruits. They tell you about the lessons learned with nature; They show him the flock tamed by affection. <br>
    <sup>11</sup> Illuminated by the soft light of the Eternal Father, the couple sits at His feet as before, to hear His teachings. The Creator, looking at them with tenderness, goes on to warn them of danger. Orienting them about the sacrifices of lambs, which were important in the sense of always keeping in mind the certainty of a coming Savior who, like the lambs, would be sacrificed for the redemption of sinners. The lambs, however, did not possess in themselves the power to forgive the faults, for they consisted only of symbols of the King Messiah. <br>
    <sup>12</sup> After being aware of the danger of sticking to the symbols seeking to find salvation in them, the couple received the task of transmitting these orientations to their descendants. After warning the human being, the Creator looked at the sheep that lay asleep next to his baby, and exclaimed: - How beautiful are the little lambs! - The couple, in a mixture of happiness and pain, added: - When they are awake, they jump with pleasure, forgetting that at birth and death they cause so much pain! - <br>
    <sup>13</sup> After contemplating the little lambs, God looked at the couple tenderly, revealing something that surprised them and rejoiced: —When these lambs thirty-six have come up to the altar, your arms will wrap the first child who, as they will also arise from pain. That child in your childhood will bring you joy by jumping like little lambs in your home. You must instruct him with dedication in the laws of harmony, showing him the path of redemption. Like you, he will be free to choose the direction to follow. Accepting the teaching, your life will be victorious; rejecting it, will walk towards defeat. <br>
    <sup>14</sup> Adam and Eve heard the divine promise with joy, but at the same time they experienced in the depths of being a fear of becoming aware of the responsibility they would have. They knew that Satan would make every effort to bring the promised child to perdition. It was high night when the Creator, after caressing his children, left them asleep on the soft grass. After the promise, each little lamb taken to the altar made the hope of joy that they would soon reach beating stronger in the womb. <br>
    <sup>15</sup> Thirty-six finally descended into darkness fulfilling the time determined by the Creator in which the first child would receive the light. With his hands still stained by the blood of the sacrifice, Adam protected his wife who, at the foot of the altar, fell prostrated by the pain brought by the first son. The little boy did not bring in the face the joy of freedom, but the crying of his prison; That crying would last the entire night, if it weren't for the glow of that burning flame of hope that soon attracted the attention of his attentive eyes. Wrapping it with joy, Eve comforted by her suffering, said: "I reached the promise of the Lord." He then gave him the name of Cain. <br>
    <sup>16</sup> After wrapping the baby with the soft skins of a lamb, the couple remained awake to meditate. Many were the thoughts that occupied their minds: thoughts of joy, gratitude, hope and longing for the sense of responsibility that now weighed on their shoulders. Tenderly caressing the little boy, the couple matured in their experience, understanding better the mysterious love of God that, in order to save His children, He set out to die instead of them. <br>
    <sup>17</sup> Adam and Eve were not alone in their reflections: all the intelligent beings of the Universe considered with interest the future of that helpless baby who in the interior possessed a kingdom of infinite dimensions, when disputed by the two powers in struggle. Who would be the Lord of his life ?! Would they walk their feet along the ascending path that leads to life, or the descending path that ends in the abyss of eternal death ?! Seeing the boy outline his first smile, the couple suddenly remembered the promise of the Creator that was confirmed in each sacrifice: He would be born of the woman as a child, with the mission of redeeming humanity. <br>
    <sup>18</sup> Wouldn't Cain already fulfill the promise? The infant with his bright eyes of joy resembled the little lambs that were born and raised with the mission of being sacrificed! Considering thus, the couple squeezing the son next to the chest began to cry without comfort. How terrible it would be to offer your innocent son to the rude altar! For the couple in pain, the bright sun finally appeared, reviving with its warm rays the promises that pointed to a Savior who, even in the future, would also be born of pain to fulfill the eternal plan of redemption. <br>
    <sup>19</sup> Blessed by the Creator and surrounded by the love and care of the parents, the child developed in his physical and mental nature, becoming every day the main objective of a tireless battle between the spiritual hosts. Adam and Eve, eager to make him understand the truths of salvation, took him in the arms at each dawn and, at the edge of the altar, pointed him to the distant Eden, telling those stories of emotion that little Cain still could not understand. <br>
    <sup>20</sup> What was the joy of those parents, seeing him on a sunny morning, pointing his little hand towards the home of nostalgia, pronouncing the sacred name of the Creator. Excited they took him in his arms, asking him to repeat that sublime name that, like a key to happiness, always discovered a paradise of eternal love. All the hosts of the light bowed with joy upon hearing the little boy pronounce the name of the divine King. <br>
    <sup>21</sup> The weeks were spent bringing new victims to the altar, and little Cain, the target of God's attention and care, of the hosts of light and of those tireless loving parents in the mission to instruct him, grouping his few words , always curious with everything began to question. The day was declining when the boy, who was lying on his mother's lap, asked him: —Mother, why does the sun always go like this, leaving people in the cold of darkness? - “Eva, surprised, looked at his son, without finding words to answer the question that brought him the memory of the past of happiness destroyed by his fault. <br>
    <sup>22</sup> After a moment of silence, kissing the face of little Cain, he said: - “Son, one day the sun will come to stay, bringing in its rays a world of harmony only; there will no longer be animals to fight, nor little lambs to die on the altar "- Little Cain, wishing to see that day scratch soon, said to his mother: -" Mother, tomorrow the sun will rise in paradise; ask for him to stay So I can play, play, and never sleep again. " - Eager to see the day that would never end, little Cain only fell asleep until after making his mother promise that he would ask the sun to remain. <br>
    <sup>23</sup> A new day of radiant sun to walk in the sky emerged for Cain, bringing in his rays joy and heat. While playing in the garden, his curious eyes turned many times to the sun that seemed to caress him with a smile of hope. Seeing him, however, walking in the direction of the west, the little boy ran to his mother, asking him: - “Mother, did he promise to stay?” - Eva, taking him in her arms, smiled at him trying to make her understand with simple words, while pointing The distant paradise, the story of redemption. <br>
    <sup>24</sup> The sun would come one day to stay. Cain, dissatisfied with the mother's words, showed no patience to wait for that day that lay in the distant future. He repeated in tears: - "I want the sun now, not tomorrow!" - Eva patiently tried to calm her son, talking about the light of God, which can turn night into day. He loved him and could fill his little heart with brightness, joy and patience. I could thus, wait happily the day of your dreams. Balancing the head in rejection of the mother's comfort, Cain pronounced between sobs: - "I want the sun because I can see it, not the Eternal." - <br>
    <sup>25</sup> Like a painful arrow, Cain's words of rebellion penetrated Eva's heart, making her cry bitterly. The faithful throughout the Universe joined that cry. An infinite sadness loomed over the heart of the rejected Creator. The first steps along the descending path of rebellion were outlined in Cain's gestures. How many would follow him to death! Unaware of the sadness that had fallen over the realm of light, Adam, seeing the sun decline on the horizon, left his work in the field heading towards the house. <br>
    <sup>26</sup> He had a song in his heart as he walked toward another encounter with his people. As he approached the altar, he saw with him his companion prostrated in tears. Little Cain lay there crying too. Taking him in his arms, Adam asked anxiously: - "What happened my son?" - Cain sadly replied: - "Mom let the sun go still" - sheltering the son with his left arm, Adam put his right hand on the Eva's shoulder, but found no words to comfort her. The phrase said by his son, seemed to tear his heart, making him relive the fall. After re-flexing, Adam feeling guilty replied to Cain: - "It was dad who let the sun go still my son." - <br>
    <sup>27</sup> With sobs of great sadness, Adam joined them in tears. The memory of the Savior, however, comforted him. Drying his tears and those of his little son, he said tenderly: - "We can rejoice, little son, for God promised to make the sun shine forever in the sky; he will be like the fire that appears on the altar, expelling the darkness of the night"-. With his eyes turned towards the last clearing of the tree, Cain remained without comfort. In that evening, there was not as usual a cheerful dinner. The small family, saddened, remained silent to meditate for long hours, until sleepy they slept under the starlight. <br>
    <sup>28</sup> The enemy and his hosts, in sarcasm of evil mocked on that night the suffering of God and His faithful. Repeating the words of rebellion of little Cain, he boasted as victor. In a challenge to the Creator he pronounced: - Look how this my little slave rejects you! The same will happen with all those who are to be born. I am sure that the right of domain will never get out of my hands. - All rebel hosts echoed the insults of the deceiver, humiliating the subjects of light who suffered from the side of the Eternal. With his insults, the enemy sought to make God desist from His plan of redemption. If that happened, his kingdom of darkness would extend for all eternity, supplanting the dominion of light.
    29 In response to the enemy's challenge, the Eternal solemnly affirmed: “Even if everyone rejects me, I will keep the promise. - The Creator could not bear the thought of seeing little Cain walking towards perdition. Through him he interceded every day, offering to justice His blood that he would pour. Powerful angels kept him at all times, frightening the spiritual darkness that stalked him trying to make him insensitive to the benefits of salvation, which were illustrated by the symbols. Adam and Eve in their tireless ministry of love, every day they taught Cain the spiritual lessons illustrated in nature. <br>
    <sup>30</sup> On every Saturday they tried to affirm in their youthful minds the hope of an eternal life, which would be the fruit of the Savior's sacrifice. After living a life without sin, he would die like a lamb, in order to cast out darkness forever. Cain was sometimes moved by the teachings, but he almost always questioned hesitantly. He rebelledly asked: - Why did Samael go to rebel ?! —One night, refusing to hear his parents' advice, he accused them of all evil saying: - "If now we don't have a sun to shine, it is your fault." - <br>
    <sup>31</sup> The contemplation of distant Eden bathed in the sun gave birth to thoughts of adventure in the youthful heart of Cain. He began to think: "This paradise is not as far away as Dad and Mom affirm. Why wait and suffer so long ?! He is so beautiful! It is from him that the sun rises every day! If we conquer it , it will be easy to stop the light at its source; so we will live in a paradise of eternal sun. Cain's adventure ideas filled Adam and Eve's heart with sadness. They saw that their interest was only for the present time; he dreamed of a paradise of happiness and light conquered by its strength. <br>
    <sup>32</sup> In his plans, he did not feel the need for a Savior; - Why, if he was so young, intelligent, full of life and ideals? - So he said. The days of struggles, intercessions and sacrifices for the destiny of Cain were passed. Precious opportunities to become attached to the Savior arose every day before him, but he rejected them all, one by one. In his disbelief he came to doubt the existence of that God, which he had never seen. To the parents who, afflicted but always with patience, tried to free him from the perdition towards which he was walking, he promised one day, after smiling with disbelief, to believe in the Creator and His plan of salvation, if the case were to occur. that He became visible at the time of sacrifice. <br>
    <sup>33</sup> With burning faith, those parents began to cry out to the Eternal. His visible presence could, who knows, save that beloved son who became more rebellious every day. The Creator heard the cry of the afflicted parents. Although he knew that his appearance would hardly break his rebellious spirit in the heart of young Cain, he was willing to satisfy the request. He would extend the friendly arms to Cain, trying with love to conquer his heart. <br>
    <sup>34</sup> As he knew his longings and dreams of adventure, He could easily identify with him, captivating him, for He was also Someone who had always carried dreams of adventure in his chest; Hadn't the creation of the Universe been a great adventure ?! Hadn't it been His dream to see him encrusted with glowing suns, illuminating billions of worlds with his brightness ?! Wasn't he also the greatest of His going through the valley of death, in search of the conquest of distant Eden, forever uniting the sun in his sky ?! They had many things in common! Cain was curious on that sixth day. <br>
    <sup>35</sup> On the face of the parents, I saw the encouragement and joy, fruits of a great faith. Stimulated by that expression of confidence, the young man began to help them in the preparations for Holy Saturday. The Sun finally slipped away rolling towards the west, leaving as usual its trace of nostalgia announcing fear. In the darkness, Cain discerned the white figure of the lamb being lifted to the altar by the hands of the father — that tireless priest who was always imploring the Creator for the salvation of his beloved son. - <br>
    <sup>36</sup> With his hand raised, Adam was preparing for the blow that could, who knows, break his disbelief in Cain's heart, giving rise to the belief in salvation in a single moment. The prayer of faith escapes from his lips: - Eternal Father, hear my request; My son needs You! Only one look from You can conquer it. Come Lord! - This sincere prayer fell into the ears of that son touching him. Only the prayer would be enough to convince him of the real existence of a Savior. <br>
    <sup>37</sup> While drying the tears of emotion, Cain shudders at the sound of the blow of death. Everything was solemn at that time; Would the Creator of the world come in response to the prayer of love ?! How would you face it in disbelief ?! A strong glow soon enveloped the entire hill also bathing the eastern valley. The wide open eyes of Cain then settled on the kind eyes of the Creator, which brought a shine above the sun, but not obfuscating. <br>
    <sup>38</sup> Contemplating him with admiration, Cain exclaimed: “He is young like me, and he looks like the Sun!” Adam and Eve, moved by the great nostalgia, had the desire to jump into the Savior's chest and kiss him, but let Him meet first with Cain With joy, they saw the precious son wrapped in the arms of the great friend, who looked like his star. After the long hug, God hugged and kissed also the dear couple, partners in suffering. With joy, they went for a walk in the hill gardens. <br>
    <sup>39</sup> The Creator and Cain went to the center, and Adam and his companion to the sides. How much happiness they experienced in those steps! They were complete. Cain, conquered by the affection of the Eternal Father, showed him his animals of esteem and his small garden laden with beautiful flowers. As I was delighted to see them colorful on that night undone by the brightness of the Creator, as in the daylight! It seemed as if the Sun itself had come down to them. When thinking about the Sun, Cain as he loved him very much, began to talk about him saying: - As he is beautiful and good! When he leaves, however, he leaves in his tears of blood a feeling of sadness and fear. <br>
    <sup>40</sup> Everything disappears in his absence: the animals, the garden; Even the birds silence their songs! ... But it is enough for him to say that he will appear and, everything is full of charm; Nature wakes up from her meekness, still appearing to fear darkness, but when she sees them flee, she remains alert and sings; The animals, the birds, the garden, ... everything returns to a happy life! But, this happiness always ends !!! - <br>
    <sup>41</sup> After speaking these words, Cain, looking at the Creator, inquired curiously: "Dad always says that it was you who created the Sun. Is it true?" With a sincerity smile, God answered yes. In the beginning, Cain continued, was he already fleeing to the west? - "He never flees," replied the Eternal, "it is the world that flees from him. He is sad with that ingratitude! - - But how? - Cain asked, looking curiously at His face of light. With affectionate words, God began to tell him the story of Lucifer who, in his ingratitude banished from his eyes and from the eyes of a multitude of creatures, the brightness of His face - the True Sun. - <br>
    <sup>42</sup> After acting like this, he deceived many by saying that the Sun was the one who fled from them. With his cunning, the Creator continued, the rebel angel tried to drag the human being into darkness, and he succeeded. The Sun on that day, wept so many tears of blood, that bathed the whole sky. In his last sigh of light, however, he promised the world already taken away by darkness, to return one day to shine forever, filling his entire bosom of life. <br>
    <sup>43</sup> After saying these words, the Eternal looking at that young man, with an expression of sadness in his eyes, concluded by saying: "Today, the rebel angel promises to his followers that he will go with his strength to stop the sun, but he will never be able to realize that plan, because it does not have the bond that could stop it: love. - Crestfallen, Cain heard from the Creator's lips that story of promises, which he had already tired of hearing from his parents. That story did not give him pleasure, as it showed a long night of sacrifices on the altar, and of a Savior to perish in pain. <br>
    <sup>44</sup> Actually, Cain saw no reason for all that. Why not banish the suffering away by coloring the darkness of light ?! In an effort to conquer him, the Eternal with much love looked at that dissatisfied young man, and told him that only the blood of His sacrifice could make the Sun shine forever, in a realm of eternal happiness and peace. There was no other way for that conquest. Therefore, you should be patient, resting under His care. <br>
    <sup>45</sup> After conversing for a long time with Cain, in an attempt to make him recognize his need for salvation, Yahweh, turning to the couple, began to comfort them with the promise of the birth of another son. Thirty-six more sacrifices would be counted, and his arms would wrap the second son. It would also be born of pain, but it would bring in the eyes the brightness and comfort of salvation. His testimony of faithfulness would be perpetuated by all generations, in the symbol of an altar covered in blood. The weeks went by, bringing the couple new joys and sorrows: from a heart full of life to beat in Eva's womb, and from a void with the smell of death to grow in the heart of young Cain. <br>
    <sup>46</sup> Although he had been dazzled by the manifestation of God, that appearance in nothing changed his arrogant way of thinking about the meaning of life. He saw no sense in the sacrifices offered on the altar. In the days that followed his encounter with the Creator, he argued with his parents saying, "If I were powerful like the Eternal, I would never submit to the sacrifice to reconquer the lost kingdom." He is strong, and shines like the sun. He could with one word expel all darkness, returning paradise to us. <br>
    <sup>47</sup> Why so much suffering ?! - With that argument, Cain was supposed to be wiser than the Creator. Who knows if, in an upcoming meeting I would have the opportunity to advise him. In this way, the young Cain immersed himself more and more in the abyss of pride and selfishness - instead of illusions where he was going, - thinking of walking towards victory. Hadn't Lucifer been together with a third of the heavenly hosts attracted by that same illusion ?! The gracious God, still, would not seal Cain's fate without first attempting to save him from eternal ruin. <br>
    <sup>48</sup> That undeserved grace, the fruit of divine love, would be granted to all human beings who were born in this world.
