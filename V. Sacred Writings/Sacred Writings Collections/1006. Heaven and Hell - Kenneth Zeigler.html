<h2>Preface</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">And	There Was War in Heaven</p>

            <p> SINCE his earliest days, man has been incessantly curious about the world around him. What mysteries might lie beyond the next mountain, up the treacherous jungle river, or across the vast unexplored seas? His curiosity has carried him far from his home. From the deserts to the poles, from the depths of the oceans to the depths of space, man has pushed back the frontiers of his universe. <br><br>

            Yet one realm, one frontier remains unexplored, hidden beyond the impenetrable curtain that we know as death. To some it is no frontier at all, but rather a vast nothingness, an eternal sleep from which we shall never awaken. To others it is a wondrous land filled with endless and eternal possibilities. There is one certainty—we shall all embark upon an expedition into that mysterious realm.<br><br>

            So what lies beyond this life? Does something of us remain beyond that last breath? Is death the end, or just the beginning? To the Christian, the answer is clear; death is the beginning of a journey that extends beyond the vanishing point on the horizon, through eternity into infinity.
            But what is life after death like?<br><br>

            The earliest writings of the Old Testament did not confront the issue of life after death directly. Later, events like Saul’s encounter with Samuel’s spirit through the incantations of the Witch of Endor (see First Samuel 28:4-25), suggest that an afterlife exists. Yet in the Book of Ecclesiastes, Solomon seems to suggest that there is no life after death, and that the dead know nothing.<br><br>

            For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten (Ecclesiastes 9:5).<br><br>

            Even at the time of Jesus, the Jews were strongly divided on this issue.
            The Pharisees believed in the existence of spirits, angels, and the resurrection of the dead. But the Sadducees believed in none of these things.<br><br>

            For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both (Acts 23:8).

            Jesus spoke extensively about the Kingdom of Heaven, as well as about outer darkness, a place of wailing and gnashing of teeth. In the parable of Lazarus and the rich man, He even gives us a glimpse into that realm (see Luke 16:19-31). Yet, even in the New Testament, our glimpses of Heaven and Hell are vague and fleeting.<br><br>

            In the middle ages, the poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) gave a detailed account in his Divine Comedy as to the nature of Heaven and Hell.
            Was his a vision, a divine revelation, or just a satirical commentary on the state of the Church? My personal feeling—it was a little bit of both.<br><br>

            Divine revelation, from God’s Holy Spirit, must travel from our spirit, through the filter of our own experience, and onto paper. Along the way, it can potentially lose something in translation. Likewise, it can also pick up extra baggage. This is why we must not be too quick to accept the words of a modern-day prophet or visionary at face value. We must first take a long hard look at the fruit of that person’s spirit. That which is flesh is flesh, and that which is spirit is spirit. Spiritual revelation does not come from the flesh.<br><br>

            In the last few years, several prominent books on the subjects of Heaven and Hell have been published—books inspired by divine revelation. I will not be so bold, or so foolish, as to judge the merits of these works based on my own experiences. I can only attest as to where and how this work you hold in your hand arose. As you read through it, you might encounter startling similarities between it and other works. There are many ministries, but only one Spirit.<br><br>

            I am a scientist, schooled in the discipline of the scientific method. My encounter with Christ came in the fall of 1972 when I was 18 years old.
            Before that, I openly admit to being most cynical when it came to spiritual matters. Through an amazing near-death experience, I became a new creature through Christ Jesus. But, that didn’t mean that I abandoned the scientific method; far from it.<br><br>

            There is no conflict whatsoever between my faith in God, and my studies in astronomy, physics, and quantum mechanics. Indeed, through the melding of these influences, I have received a most unique perspective on the universe. That perspective will become clear as you read this book.
            Through it, I hope you will come to see the places called Heaven and Hell in the grand scheme of a multidimensional universe.<br><br>

            Do I truly believe that Heaven and Hell are as I describe them here?
            Absolutely, yes. The elements of this book emerge from my studies of the Bible, the divinely inspired Word of God. Others emerge from my studies in science. Even the study of history plays a role.<br><br>

            As a man who loves God, with all of my soul and all of my heart, I try to maintain a healthy and vital prayer life. Yet some of the questions I ask God in prayer are, to say the least, unusual. They have included questions about the nature of space time, the fabric of the universe, and cosmological constants. And, yes, they have been answered, though it may take me some time to comprehend those answers. God is a loving Father, but His thoughts are far above ours.<br><br>

            And, yes, I have experienced powerful visions that have shaped the chapters of this book. I have tried to reproduce them faithfully. This book is a work of fiction, viewed against the backdrops of a Heaven and Hell that are very real. I hope that the story that unfolds before you will be a blessing to you and that it will bring glory to our heavenly Father.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<!-- <p class="chapterTitle">The Vision</p> -->

        <p>
            A flurry of snowflakes swept around their car, as Chris Davis and his young wife, Serena, sped down the dark country road toward home. Serena placed her arm around her husband as she gazed out into the swirling snow, illuminated in the glare of the headlights. To her it seemed like a sort of magical fantasy, a grand dance of snowflakes played out against a darkened stage as large as nature itself. It was a special performance, just for the two of them.<br><br>

            She was still dressed in the medieval garb she had worn to the ARS banquet. How she loved to dress up—the long, flowing lace dress was an escape from the realities of the technological present. She often thought about being part of a simpler time and place, how wonderful it must have been.<br><br>

            Chris smiled broadly as he glanced toward his lovely wife. They’d had a wonderful evening of food, laughter, and good company; still, Serena suspected that Chris played the part of a medieval scholar at these dress-up events more to please her than anything else.<br><br>

            Another ten minutes and they would be home. They would slip into something more comfortable, and curl up together in front of the fireplace.<br>
            After all, tomorrow was Saturday; they had the whole night to play.<br><br>

            Chris didn’t see the patch of ice on the curve of the darkened highway until it was too late. When they had passed this way three hours before, only a trickle of water was melting from a roadside snow bank. Now, it formed a deadly sheet of ice.<br><br>

            His eyes grew wide with fear as the small car slipped across the solid yellow line and into the opposing lane of traffic. He battled for control as the tires slid wildly back and forth. If they’d had the road to themselves, it would have been scary enough; but then they saw the headlights of an 18-wheeler that appeared out of nowhere and was bearing toward them. It was the dark essence of a nightmare, a possibility neither of them had ever envisioned. Now they stared at it head-on.<br><br>

            The car hit the guardrail first, then bounded into the path of the oncoming leviathan. The impact ripped through their world, as the sheet metal of their small import bent and twisted like cardboard.<br><br>

            “Oh Chris!” cried Serena, trying her best to brace herself. She was propelled toward the windshield because no seatbelt restrained her.<br><br>

            Chris slammed into the steering wheel and then against the driver’s side door. The car spun; then tumbled over and over again, crashing through the guardrail and into a power pole where it finally came to rest, wrapped about the stout pillar, a steaming mass of twisted metal. For a moment, there was nothing but silence.<br><br>

            With difficulty, Serena picked herself up from the cold, snowy ground.
            She was still shaking as she rose to her feet. She was disoriented, surprised not to be in pain. She remembered being tossed about in the tumbling car, or did she? The past few minutes were a blur. Perhaps she was in shock, injured beyond the point of pain. She looked at herself and discovered that she had sustained not a single bruise or cut. Even her dress had survived the impact without so much as a rip. Somehow she’d been thrown from the car and landed in the soft snow.<br><br>

            She glanced back at the car and saw that the passenger’s side door was crumpled, but very much closed. The window was closed too. She thought that the door must have flown open during the crash, just long enough for her to have been thrown free. She looked more closely—was that blood on the window? She couldn’t be sure from where she was standing, it was too dark. No, it couldn’t be. She looked at her arms and legs and felt her head once more to verify that she was fully intact. Not a scratch.<br><br>

            “Unbelievable!” she gasped. Had luck been with her or what? Then a wave of horror swept over her like a dark shroud. Maybe it is blood, but not hers. “Chris! Where are you? Oh God, are you all right?”<br><br>

            Serena was filled with dread. What if her love was still within that twisted wreck, perhaps horribly crushed? Suppose he was dead! How could she go on?<br><br>

            “I’m OK,” Chris said.
            Serena turned to see Chris rise to unsteady legs on the other side of the car. He seemed dazed, but unharmed. His eyes met Serena’s.
            “Are you all right?”
            “Yes, I am now,” she said.
            Chris looked at the mangled car, took a step toward it, then stopped.
            “Serena, do you smell that? It’s gasoline—it might explode!”<br><br>

            That was a thought she hadn’t considered. It would be indeed ironic to miraculously survive the crash, only to be killed in an explosion. Serena ran as fast as she could through the snow, crossing the guardrail, and meeting Chris along the side of the road, about 50 feet from the car. They embraced.<br><br>

            “Thank you Lord Jesus,” Chris said, wrapping his arms about his shivering wife. “I thought for sure I’d lost you. That old car can be replaced —you can’t. Maybe our next car will have airbags.”<br><br>

            He looked back at the 18-wheeler which had finally managed to stop about a hundred yards down the road. The driver had jumped from his rig and was running toward them. Chris waved his arms in the air. “I bet we scared the begebers out of that poor guy.”<br><br>

            “And don’t forget me,” Serena said, managing a slight chuckle. “You’ll have an interesting story to tell in church this Sunday.” Serena turned toward the car that was twisted around the power pole and shook her head.
            “People just don’t walk away from these kinds of accidents, but we did.”<br><br>

            “Maybe a guardian angel saved us,” Chris said, taking her hand and walking toward the truck driver. “It’s very possible. With God, all things are possible.”
            That response didn’t surprise Serena in the least. Chris often spoke of heavenly matters. Actually, she was surprised that he’d never become a preacher himself. He would have made a good one. Perhaps it was her lack of spirituality and religious conviction that had hindered him. She hoped not.<br><br>

            They stopped about 20 feet from the car. Amazingly, the right headlight was still shining, illuminating their surroundings. The glare of the lone headlamp prevented them from getting a really good look at the full extent of the damage. They’d been so concerned about each other, that they hadn’t given the condition of the car much thought. It was totaled, that much was certain. Chris hesitated for a moment, apparently considering if it was safe to draw any closer to the twisted hulk. There was no sign of a fire, and only a trace of steam rising from the shattered radiator. The only event in this car’s future was a journey to the scrap yard.<br><br>

            “We’re OK!” yelled Chris, waving again at the approaching truck driver. It seemed strange that he didn’t respond.<br><br>

            “Wait here,” Chris said, stepping from the glare of the headlight and toward the contorted hunk of metal and glass.<br><br>

            “Maybe we should all wait for the state police,” Serena said. “The car could still explode.
            “It’s OK,” Chris said to his wife. “If it was going to explode it would have done so already.” He turned toward the car again. “This is strange; the driver’s side door is still closed. So is the window. How in the world was I thrown clear?”<br><br>

            “Oh Chris, I wish you’d wait,” repeated Serena, as her husband approached the driver’s side door. “I have a really bad feeling about this.”
            Chris dismissed his wife’s warning, and looked in the car window. His expression spoke of his horror. He blinked, rubbed his eyes, yet the apparition remained.<br><br>

            “Serena, come here! This, this can’t be!”
            Serena hesitated, then joined her husband by the car door. “Chris, no, oh God, it’s us! How can we be in there and out here at the same time?”<br><br>

            Now, the truck driver, too, stood at the driver’s side door. His flashlight revealed two contorted and blood-soaked figures, a young man and woman.
            He did not notice the uninjured doubles standing by his side.<br><br>

            Serena stepped back and into the glare of the lone headlight, as she witnessed her husband’s hand pass through the driver’s shoulder like some sort of phantasm. Then she noticed that her body cast no shadow on the snowy landscape. “No,” she whimpered.<br><br>

            Chris retreated to his wife’s side, speechless. It was Serena who spoke the unthinkable.<br><br>

            “Chris, we’re dead, we’re ghosts.” Her voice was quivering and uncertain. “But we can’t be, I mean, I can still feel and think. My body is warm, I’m breathing.” Serena reached for her wrist, searched frantically for her pulse. She was relieved when she found a fast but strong rhythm. “My heart is still beating, how can I be dead?”<br><br>

            Chris didn’t respond. Something else had caught his attention, something that hadn’t been there just an instant before—a warm breeze was blowing from somewhere, driving away the cold of the winter night.<br><br>

            Serena turned around to see a bright point of light floating in midair. It looked like a beautiful, white star, adrift some 30 feet away. It grew brighter, becoming an increasing disk of luminance, pushing back the darkness of the snowy night. No, not a disk, a portal with depth and substance, a softly glowing tunnel, and at its end, a light that now appeared as bright as the sun. No, brighter even than that.<br><br>

            The distraught truck driver took no notice of the wondrous spectacle, as he struggled to open the twisted driver’s side door of the car. Why should he? This luminous phenomenon was part of another world, another reality.
            It illuminated Chris and Serena in its radiance, yet its light seemed not to affect anything else around them.<br><br>

            Chris hugged his wife and gazed into the light. “It’s so bright. I know that it should hurt my eyes, but it doesn’t. And can you feel it, Serena? Can you feel the love coming from the light? Did you ever feel anything like it?”<br><br>

            Serena shielded her eyes from the light. It was so bright. She too sensed the love it emanated, yet she felt fear as well. She seemed frozen in time, unable to move. She’d read about this sort of apparition. It was the ever-present constant in all near-death experiences—the tunnel of light. It was real. But this was no near-death experience—this was real, a one way tunnel from this life to whatever existed beyond.<br><br>

            “Come on,” Chris said. “That’s where we’ve got to go.”
            “I don’t know about this, Chris,” warned Serena. “You don’t know what’s at the end of that tunnel. It might not be what you think.”<br><br>

            Apparently Chris hadn’t heard her, or hadn’t wanted to, because he began walking toward the light, drawing her with him. She walked by his side, drawing strength from his touch. Without his help, she was certain that she would not have been able to move at all. She squeezed his hand. Yet his touch was becoming ever more tenuous. It wasn’t that his grip was weakening, it was her ability to feel his touch that was fading. It was almost as if he were, somehow, less real. He didn’t seem to notice as he walked boldly toward the portal.<br><br>

            They were at the very threshold of the tunnel, when her hand slipped from her husband’s grip. A moment later, he vanished into the soft glow, leaving her behind. She tried to follow him, but no matter how hard she tried she couldn’t move. Why hadn’t he returned for her? Didn’t he realize that she was no longer beside him?<br><br>

            “Chris!” she cried, yet her voice was barely above a whisper.
            She stood there, paralyzed and weeping. She had been forbidden entrance. It was a force greater than her will that had decreed it, and it was not within her power to disobey.<br><br>

            The brilliant light at the end of the portal faded from sight, even as the warm breeze ceased. It was replaced once more by the cold darkness of the winter night. Then the apparition vanished completely. A chill swept through Serena, a chill that went beyond the coldness of the night. She’d been denied the right to enter the next life, if that was indeed what lay beyond.<br><br>

            She was gripped with fear. Minutes passed, minutes of near total paralysis, giving her ample time to ponder her fate. Was it her destiny to become a ghost, a lost and restless spirit doomed to wander Earth forever?
            She had read more than her share of books on the topic as a youth. Her inability to move? Some experts insisted that ghosts remained close to the place of their deaths for years. Perhaps, like her, they experienced some form of spiritual paralysis that kept them there.<br><br>

            Sure, there were lots of people who had claimed to have had visitations from the dead, and some of them were pretty scary, but there was no documented proof for their claims. She had come to dismiss such things as hoaxes, perhaps results of a natural phenomenon compounded by an overactive imagination. The current circumstances, though, were compelling her to reconsider her previous conclusions.<br><br>

            In the midst of her contemplations, her ghostly existence was interrupted as another unearthly portal materialized out of the emptiness, not far away. Yet this one was very different from the first. It was an undulating violet-colored corridor, pulsing with arcs of blue electricity. It seemed endless and foreboding, a dark passage leading into infinity.<br><br>

            No sense of love emanated from this dark abyss; indeed, it seemed the incarnation of despair. It was brooding, sinister, yet irresistible. This was her portal, the gateway to her destiny.<br><br>

            “No, please, I don’t want to go in there,” she murmured.<br><br>

            But what she wanted didn’t matter. She slowly stepped toward it as in a trance, and felt as light as a snowflake as she was swept off her feet and into the void of the portal. She felt its electric presence, like an army of ants crawling over every inch of her body—it was cold, far colder than the winter night.<br><br>

            She became nothing more than a weightless and inconsequential vapor as she tumbled down end over end into a bottomless pit. It was a helpless, sickening feeling.<br><br>

            Tenuous clouds of red and violet against a dark gray background swept past her. Was she really falling or just being swept along by some invisible current? She couldn’t tell. The experience was totally disorienting and absolutely terrifying.<br><br>

            She looked at her hand and discovered that it was nothing more than a translucent form. She gazed down to see that her body was also transparent —like one of those plastic models she pieced together when she was in junior high school. Being the model was not nearly so much fun.<br><br>

            She screamed, yet she couldn’t hear her voice over the roar of the ethereal winds that swept her along. She wondered if there was a destination. Perhaps she would be swept along through this ethereal realm throughout all eternity.<br><br>

            She thought of Chris. Where was he? Was he experiencing anything like this? She hoped not.<br><br>

            How long or how far she was carried, she couldn’t say. In this realm there were no constants, no frames of reference for either time or space.
            Even existence itself was tenuous, measured only by the extent of her fear.<br><br>

            She felt a jolt, as if her course had been abruptly altered. There was light ahead, shining forth like a lone beacon into this realm of eternal twilight. A moment later a new world seemed to materialize around her, replacing the ethereal nothingness of the tunnel through which she had passed. She stood in the middle of an arching corridor, perhaps a dozen feet wide, where the floor, walls, and ceiling were composed of the finest, cultured white marble.<br><br>

            She was whole again, a physical entity with weight and all of her senses intact. She turned around, surprised to discover a blank wall, not the formless passageway through which she had just traversed. She touched the wall, caressing its cold smooth surface, as if to verify that this wall was indeed as substantial as it appeared. It was.<br><br>

            Twenty feet ahead, the corridor opened into a chamber of brilliant white vastness. Slowly, deliberately, she walked toward it, unable to resist.<br><br>

            The chamber beyond was like nothing she had ever seen. Before her was something of great brilliance, that she could not immediately distinguish. Its radiance caused the white-tiled marble floor to glisten brightly.<br><br>

            Serena spun around and saw many tiers of seats descended in a square pattern toward the central arena in which she stood. In those seats sat a great multitude of people, all dressed in pure white. Standing in the central arena, she was separated from them by a shimmering marble wall, perhaps 8 feet or so in height. All eyes were focused on her, which gave her a very uneasy feeling. She was the center of attention. What did they want from her? What did they expect her to do?<br><br>

            She gazed up to see that this place had no ceiling in the conventional sense. Although the perimeter of the vast arena was replete with many towering marble columns, they appeared to serve no purpose beyond a decorative one. Above her, great billowing clouds towered toward an azure blue sky. It was awesome, yet frightening.<br><br>

            Again her gaze turned toward the bright radiance before her. She could perceive a great white throne, upon which sat a being who appeared to be the source of the radiance. She could not see the figure clearly, nor could she see what lay beyond the throne. Perhaps it was nothing more than the fourth wall of the arena, but maybe it was something else.<br><br>

            The impression she felt now was not so different from that she had felt emanating from the portal that her husband had vanished into. There was an overwhelming sense of love here, as though love itself could take on a physical form. Yet there was something else—fear. The fear did not originate from the being upon the throne, but rather was generated from within her own soul as a result of his tremendous presence.<br><br>

            Out of the glare stepped a slender being, standing well over 6 feet in height. Its pallid flesh took on essentially human contours, though unusually smooth and exceptionally symmetrical. It wore white sandals upon very human feet, and was clothed in a long and flowing white robe.
            From its waist, hung a long sword, its blade hidden beneath an intricately crafted golden scabbard.<br><br>

            Yet this being’s most striking feature was a pair of enormous white wings, which arched outward and upward from the back of its shoulders. If fully extended, Serena was certain they would have easily spanned a dozen or more feet from tip to tip. She was unsure as to whether they were composed of individual feathers, or even whether they served anything more than an ornamental function.<br><br>

            Its eyes were blue and piercing, and its golden hair long and glistening.
            It was difficult to determine the being’s gender, and Serena wondered if gender was even relevant when dealing with an angel.<br><br>

            The awesome yet beautiful being watched her every move carefully. Its expression betrayed no emotion.<br><br>

            “Welcome, Serena,” the being said in a voice that did not reveal its gender. “Come with me, child. The time of your judgment is at hand.” It motioned with its right hand toward the brilliant being behind it.<br><br>

            “My judgment?” gasped Serena, turning suddenly pale. “I don’t understand.”<br><br>

            “It is appointed once to a man or woman to die, then to judgment,” was the reply.
            “But where is Chris? He was with me but we got separated.”<br><br>

            “He is not here,” replied the angel, placing a gentle hand upon the young woman’s shoulder, guiding her on the way. “It is not the time to speak of such things. It is your moment to stand before God, your creator, and give an account of your 28 years on Earth.”<br><br>

            “God?” repeated Serena. “You mean God, like in the Bible?”<br><br>

            “The only God,” confirmed the angel, who hurried Serena across the marble courtyard. “He whose will holds sway over the entire universe, over all things.”<br><br>

            Serena felt confused and increasingly fearful as she was guided toward the very heart of the immense glow whose brilliance dominated the entire arena. She was taken to within a few dozen feet of the great being upon the throne. At the urging of the angel, she fell to her knees.<br><br>

            Amidst the great luminance, Serena did her best to make out the features of He who sat upon the throne. Serena wondered if it might be sacrilegious to even make the attempt. He was clearly of enormous stature, at least 10 feet in height. Like the angels, He was robed in white, yet every part of this being glowed, especially His eyes. He seemed to have long golden hair, but not the long beard she had often seen in paintings. For a time, His gaze seemed focused upon the kneeling woman; then it shifted to one side.<br><br>

            “Let the books be opened,” He announced in a voice like thunder.<br><br>

            Serena turned to her right to see another angel robed in white. This one stood behind an ornate crystal podium that faced the being who sat upon the great white throne. Atop the podium was a large open book. He seemed to be studying it intently, turning page after page.<br><br>

            Serena directed her gaze once more toward the figure upon the throne.
            This time, instead of the figure, she saw an image of herself as a young child playing with her friends amidst a cloud of blue. Events that brought back fond memories, as well as those she would have sooner forgotten, swept through the vision before her. She saw herself learning sign language to befriend a deaf girl she had known in her youth. A 12-year-old Serena collected a thin and tossed away kitten from behind the mall and nursed it back to health. She saw herself as a teen reading to her grandmother in the hospital. She remembered the love they shared.<br><br>

            Yet all was not goodness and light. She witnessed once more the dreadful arguments between herself and her mother; heard the harsh and angry words. They had argued about so many things—clothes, friends, schoolwork. Her mother had been a rigid disciplinarian who seemed to lack the ability to see a situation from any perspective other than her own. The strong-willed youth’s rebellion was inevitable.<br><br>

            In the end, their war of words had escalated in directions Serena had never expected. It was her mother who had finally resorted to committing her to a mental hospital at the age of 14. Rebellious, mentally unstable, and a danger to herself; is how Serena’s mother described her daughter to the hospital administration. Nothing Serena said altered the fate her mother had selected for her. Her background as a youth probation officer for the county gave her more credibility and more contacts within the system than a confused teenage girl. Eventually, committing her daughter to a mental institution was a simple matter.<br><br>

            Serena had been confined in that nightmarish realm for more than three months. Those were the darkest of the dark times. The drugs, the incessant testing, the mind games that they referred to as counseling, broke her will.
            In a world of profound isolation, she was compelled to conform to her mother’s will and admit her own failings. Anything else was self-destructive.<br><br>

            She remembered night after night praying for deliverance from that dreadful place. As time passed and her prayers went seemingly unanswered, her mind descended into a sort of fantasy realm, a place of escape from the unpleasant reality around her. She imagined herself as a fair maiden imprisoned in a dark and foreboding dungeon by an evil wizard. Her surroundings, though far from the stereotypical medieval dungeon, reinforced her fantasy—locked doors, cries in the night, constant heavy-handed supervision.<br><br>

            In the end, it was her stepfather who had been her knight in shining armor. It was he who had finally brought her home, against her mother’s wishes. In the ensuing years, he was the diplomat who had managed to keep their home in a state of uneasy peace. Yet the rift between Serena and her mother remained until her mother’s death nine years later.<br><br>

            Still the dark times continued.<br><br>

            Although she was an exceptional student in school, well-mannered and well-liked by her teachers, the fearful months in the mental hospital had marked her both socially and emotionally. She had become very quiet and withdrawn, making few friends of her own age in school. Most of her classmates stayed away from the thin, plain-looking youth who had spent time in the “nut house.”<br><br>

            All sorts of stories about her mental state were rumored throughout the school. Because of her good grades, she was inducted into the National Honor Society, yet even this accolade gave her no status among her peers.
            When the school day came to a close, she withdrew into a world of her own.<br><br>

            Now, standing in the arena gazing toward the throne, she saw herself at home, in the midst of reading book after book on the occult. They had seemed harmless enough at the time, yet they had inevitably led her down a twilight path to paganism, tarot card reading, and magical rituals that gave her the illusion of power. They replaced the all too familiar sense of helplessness. She found escape in a variety of dark pursuits, imagined ancient gods and goddesses, and other fantasies that seemed preferable to the realities of her existence.<br><br>

            Somewhere along that path to perdition, her moral fiber had become tattered and frayed, as her affair with a married man 20 years her senior had demonstrated. She was 18 at the time—a wild fling with one of her former high school teachers. The affair lasted only a few months, and as far as she knew, no one had been the wiser. After all, these things happen—no one is to blame.<br><br>

            But now in the vision she saw it all very differently. There had been suspicions, innuendoes, talk of impropriety. Inevitably, the rumors had reached her lover’s wife through a variety of channels. Serena had been instrumental in weakening an already strained marriage, a marriage that eventually and inevitably dissolved.<br><br>

            “All lives in the world touch all other lives,” announced the angel who stood behind the podium. “It is within our power to influence them for the better, or for the worse. Your actions, your sins, brought about the latter.”<br><br>

            Serena’s life rushed forward in a dizzying collage of imagery. She witnessed her first marriage. She’d known Kevin since high school. He had been one of her few friends. Like her, he was an outsider and interested in the fantasy world of renaissance festivals and occult powers. It seemed a perfect match.<br><br>

            They’d had such noble goals. They would put each other through college, and in time, live the good life. They worked so hard, yet life seemed to have conspired against them. Demoralized and discouraged, Kevin had retreated into a world of computer-generated fantasy. Sitting in front of a video monitor for hours at a time, he became in cyberspace what he could not be in reality, a success, even a hero. At a time when she needed his support the most, Serena was ignored. Her attempts to become closer to him, to even be noticed, earned her a new name—a high-maintenance wife.
            That’s what Kevin had called her.<br><br>

            In the end, Serena had found the comfort she so desperately needed in the arms of other men, and at one point, another woman. In their company, she explored her darkest fantasies. She became the submissive, the slave, the witch, and the wench; whatever pleased her partner. At times she took some terrible risks, once allowing herself to be strangled to the point of asphyxiation.<br><br>

            Kevin knew of her nightly dealings, if not the specifics, at least the generalities. Yet, it didn’t seem to bother him. At least when she was out, she wasn’t disturbing his game. With Serena and Kevin pulling in two different directions, their marriage had lasted less than two years. When it was over, Serena descended into a deep depression that several times brought her close to self-destruction. Yet in the midst of her despair, had come the birth of new hope.<br><br>

            She first met Chris at the health food store where she worked. A few brief conversations with this charming man led to lunch at a downtown coffee shop, then to a more formal date. When she was with Chris, she was lifted from the depths of despair. He was charming, thoughtful, and amusing. He spoke of such wonderful ideals. He talked about God’s love, about trying to make a difference in the world. She even went to church with Chris, more to please him than to seek out his God.<br><br>

            After all, if God did actually exist, where had He been these last nine years as her life had gone from bad to worse? If He was so merciful, why had He allowed her grandmother to suffer so much during her last year on Earth? Her grandmother’s faith had remained strong to the end, yet to Serena, it seemed as if God had abandoned her. No, her life’s experiences had hardened her heart when it came to believing in the existence of a loving and merciful God.<br><br>

            Chris seemed to realize that Serena had no real interest in his church or his faith, though she did a good job at pretending she did. But it didn’t matter. He had fallen as much in love with her as she had with him. Their love led Serena to the altar one more time. This marriage was different— Chris was an attentive, compassionate husband, and Serena was absolutely faithful to him.<br><br>

            For the first time, love was more than sex, deeper than a physical sensation. Love was caring and nurturing, and in the arms of Chris, it grew stronger as the years passed. Chris claimed over and over that it was Christ within him that allowed him to love her as he did. At first, Serena wasn’t so sure that she was buying that explanation. After all, how could the spirit of a long dead prophet live inside of her husband? Still, there was clearly something wonderfully different about Chris. He had a sweet spirit about him. It was that aspect of his character that had initially attracted her to him.
            To please her husband, Serena continued to go to church with him. That was the goal foremost in her mind. She even became involved in the charitable activities of her husband’s church.<br><br>

            For Serena’s sake, Chris had done his best to take an interest in some of the things that motivated her, short of compromising his own relationship with his God. Therefore, attending renaissance fairs and the like became an integral part of their lives, and had given rise to the medieval scholar character Chris played at the events. To him, it was a small price to pay for his wife’s happiness.<br><br>

            Those five wonderful years passed before her quickly—the sweet Serena lived once again. Her husband had become her whole world. His love had changed the course of her life. Yet somewhere along the road she had missed something crucial, her husband’s love for God. Now she feared that omission might separate them for all eternity. She hoped against hope that she was wrong. After all, she had changed so much during these past five years, did so much good.<br><br>

            Surely, God would realize that, it was in the vision that played out before the courtroom for all to see. She wasn’t the woman she had been.
            Through her husband’s church she had clothed the poor, fed the hungry, and visited the sick. She had done all of these things cheerfully and without complaint. Didn’t Jesus say that whenever you did these things for even the least of God’s children, that you had done it for Him? Maybe, just maybe, it would be enough.<br><br>

            It was difficult to say how much time had transpired when the images before her finally faded. She gazed up at the figure sitting on the throne; He seemed deep in thought. Then He turned His gaze toward the angel who stood behind the podium. “Does her name appear in the Lamb’s Book of Life?”<br><br>

            The response was immediate and definitive. “No, Lord, her name does not appear in the book.”<br><br>

            God’s eyes turned toward the woman kneeling before Him. “Then the time has come to pass judgment upon you, child. Serena Farnsworth, the books have been opened, your life’s deeds have been reviewed, and you have been found wanting. Do you have anything to say in your own behalf before judgment is cast?”<br><br>

            Serena was shaking all over. Somehow she’d hoped that these proceedings would have gone a little better than they had. Chris had warned her about this day, he’d practically pleaded with her to utter those few simple words. Why hadn’t she been able to put her belief in that pagan goddess aside? The goddess wasn’t here to save her now. Only Jesus could have done that. How easy it would have been to avoid all this, to have said the prayer of faith with Chris, but now it was too late.<br><br>

            But what about her husband? God had just addressed her by her maiden name, not her husband’s name. What could that mean? Her fate was sealed, she knew that. Her concern now was for Chris. She gathered up her courage.<br><br>

            “My husband,” pleaded Serena, tears flowing down her cheeks. “What’s going to happen to him? Please, Lord, please tell me.”<br><br>

            The mighty figure upon the throne gazed into the eyes of the distraught woman. There was compassion in His eyes.<br><br>

            “Peace, be still, child. He of whom you speak is no longer your husband. That is why I call you by your maiden name. Years ago, he accepted the gift that I had offered him, the gift I offer to all humanity. My only Son was sent into your world to prove to all the reality of my love. He became the perfect sacrifice, paying the penalty for the sins of all humanity.
            Through His sacrifice, all people gained the right to be called my sons and daughters. Chris is now my son, through an act of faith. He dwells even now with a great multitude in Heaven. Let your heart not be troubled, he is in my hands now and forevermore. But you, child, you are no daughter of mine. Nor are you any longer the wife of my son.”<br><br>

            The radiant figure rose slowly to his feet. All the while His eyes remained fixed upon the woman before Him.<br><br>

            “Even as you go into outer darkness, know that My mercy endures. I know how dearly Chris loved you. To realize that you were in the hands of satan would burden him with grief for all eternity. Surely, you would not desire such a destiny for him. For this reason, I have removed all memory of your existence from his mind and from the minds of all of the saints. For them it will be as if you had never existed. You shall remember the love you shared, but he will not. It is best that things are this way, for his sake.”<br><br>

            Serena’s despair deepened, as she felt a gentle hand upon her shoulder.
            She looked over to see the angel who had guided her to this place. He motioned for her to rise to her feet; she complied.<br><br>

            “Miss Serena Farnsworth, you shall be removed from my presence and that of the saints,” commanded the mighty being before her. “In outer darkness you shall abide, a place of wailing and gnashing of teeth, there to dwell with satan and his angels until the day of final judgment. Let it be done.”<br><br>

            The angel guided Serena to the left, away from the judgment seat of God. Before her, a great amber vortex opened. Serena could sense the vast void, the emptiness that was a place without the presence of the Spirit of God. The swirling undulating corridor arched downward, downward into the eternal abyss reserved for the damned.<br><br>

            For an instant, Serena turned to behold the face of God one last time.
            She was surprised to see sadness upon the face of the Creator of the universe. Even now He grieved for her.<br><br>

            “Come, child,” bid the angel, taking her hand in his. “We must go.”<br><br>

            Serena watched the great courtroom fade into the mists as she was drawn into the vortex. She sensed she was falling as she and the angel plunged headlong toward places unknown.

  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<!-- <p class="chapterTitle">The Vision</p> -->


            <p>
              SERENA felt a sense of profound nausea as she plummeted through a confusing corridor of swirling turbulent clouds, occasionally illuminated from within and without by ragged bolts of lightning. She heard the low rumble of thunder and felt static electricity coursing around her as she plunged into the netherworld. As she proceeded ever deeper into the abyss, the environment grew darker, more sinister. The glowing clouds around her seemed to lose their luminous energy, fading to gray ragged masses of oozing vapor. Then she saw what looked like a tunnel suspended in space, a portal leading to the realm of the damned. <br><br>

              Gray clouds swirled into the tunnel like waters descending into a drain;
              and as they were swept in, they vanished into the darkness. It was a terrifying sight to behold, like a special effects expert’s version of a black hole. Yet, unlike a black hole, the walls of this tunnel appeared not to be composed of swirling vapors, but rather of dark shadowy rock that faded away to a realm of total darkness the deeper they went.<br><br>

              It didn’t make any sense, it was surreal, and yet its form was unmistakable. How could such a thing be? It was like an enormous cave, miles wide. Near its mouth, something caught Serena’s eye. It was there for but a moment; then gone. A long slithering form like a titanic snake emerged from its lair and into the light, then retreated to lurk in the shadows, just out of sight. <br><br>

              She looked to the angel who continued to firmly hold her hand in his.
              The angel’s wings were fully extended now. He turned and pivoted, navigating his way amidst the turbulent clouds and swirling eddies of this eerie realm. He drew her closer to him as the turbulence increased, as they grew closer to the dark and chilling passageway.<br><br>

              Again the form appeared, much closer this time. It was not so much like a snake as it was like a winged dragon. There were frills around its neck, and coarse scales covered its long sinuous body. It turned, rolled, and pirouetted about the entrance to its lair. Only then did Serena see the others —a myriad of tiny forms, dwarfed by the mighty serpent, being swept along with the clouds into the darkness. They were humans, a great multitude of them, caught up in the ethereal winds and swept into the darkness. The great dragon watched them, every last one of them, as they tumbled helplessly into his lair. Here and there she saw a few who had angelic escorts, like herself, but most of them were alone.<br><br>

              It was then when Serena realized that the dragon was watching her. His gaze did not leave her for a very long time as she was swept toward him.
              Her heart was filled with terror at the sight of this netherworld behemoth, whose form now filled her entire world. It was more than just his appearance or size that frightened her, it was his aura. She could sense his evil—as though evil itself was incarnated in this fleshly form. A scream froze in her throat as he loomed closer. Then he abruptly turned away, focusing his attention on others.<br><br>
              
              As she and the angel passed into the realm of darkness, they were swept into the great tunnel, descending ever deeper. The thundering turbulence faded away to a dead quiet calm. It was an eerie blackness, vast and lonely that surrounded them. The other souls she had seen but a moment before had vanished into the darkness of this realm beyond God’s universe. Only the radiant angel, who held her close to himself, lent any illumination or warmth. Serena was certain that without him, this would be a place of unimaginable cold.<br><br>

              And there was something else about this place—an emptiness that penetrated to the depths of her soul. Never had Serena felt such a thing. It went beyond a sense of emotional depression; it was a somber melancholia that emanated from the very darkness itself. She couldn’t shake the terrible feeling; something fundamental to life was missing from this place.<br><br>

              The flight continued. Though the angel’s wings swept back and forth to a slow but steady rhythm, there was not a breath of wind left in their wake.
              Perhaps there was no air here at all. In that case, these appendages upon the angel’s back were not wings at all in the conventional sense. Perhaps they were some sort of exotic propulsion system. No, what was she thinking of?
              This couldn’t be a vacuum, she was still breathing, or at least seemed to be.
              No, she wasn’t thinking straight.<br><br>

              Serena’s attention was drawn to a point of light ahead. It looked like a star, the only star in a vast universe of total darkness. Though it seemed infinitely far off, it was growing steadily brighter.<br><br>

              Within a few minutes it had come to dominate her world, pushing back the dark nothingness, bathing her in an eerie amber illumination. The bright point of light became a phosphorescent disk, an expanding ball of radiance surrounded by the nothingness of the void. She could feel its growing heat.
              It was indeed a star, a lone sun, the only source of heat and light here in this dismal realm.<br><br>

              A moment later, a dark spot appeared near its center. This sphere of darkness grew rapidly, eventually swallowing up the great luminary, and plunging them into darkness once more. Yet as the disk loomed closer, Serena could see that it was not a true realm of darkness like that which surrounded it. Its growing rim was bathed in a halo of color, a yellow inner ring transitioning slowly to green and blue, with a violet fringe that faded into the blackness. Upon its gray disk, flashes of lightning swept through swirls of mists, while dull red illumination blanketed the landscape below.
              There was so much to take in. It was both frightening and awe-inspiring.<br><br>

              The strange new vista vanished, obscured by swirling clouds of gray.
              There was a return of gravity; and an instant later, Serena felt the floor beneath her feet. The angel’s wings folded and they were walking. The mists around them parted, and Serena found herself walking down a hewn stone stairway cut into a spiraling rocky corridor. It was an almost claustrophobic environment, illuminated from above by shimmering oddly shaped crystals of fantastic size.<br><br>

              “Where are we?” gasped Serena, trying to take in the unearthly environs around her.<br>
              “A small island in the realm of outer darkness,” replied the angel, glancing only momentarily at his frightened companion.
              That wasn’t much of an answer. To someone who was new to this whole state of affairs, it was no answer at all.<br><br>

              “What is outer darkness?” asked Serena, who wanted to hear another voice just as much as she wanted to hear the answer.<br>
              “It is a spirit realm beyond your universe, beyond the creation of God,” came the reply, “a void, a place largely untouched by the hand of the Creator. Before the Father spoke the universe into existence, there was only a sea of nothingness. Outer darkness is the manifestation of that primal state.”<br><br>

              Serena looked around again. She didn’t fully comprehend all that the angel told her—everything was happening so fast.<br>
              “And into this sea of nothingness came the fallen, those who rebelled against He who had created them,” continued the angel.
              “Lucifer and his angels?” asked Serena.<br><br>

              “Among others,” confirmed the angel. “Lucifer was the name given to him by God, but he long ago rejected that name, so great was the enmity between him and his Creator. He took onto himself a new name, as did the angels who followed him.”<br><br>

              “He became satan,” Serena said.<br>
              The angel nodded. “Here, he and his legions were to be exiled for all eternity, separated from their Creator. Here, they might ponder forever the bitter fruits of their savage disobedience. Even still, God was not without mercy. Amidst the sea of nothingness, He had spoken into being an island, this island, a place where one could stand upon solid ground, breathe life-giving air, and feel the warm orange sun. It was here, that lucifer and his wayward followers came to dwell. This was to be their prison until the day of final judgment. Only in this place would they be able to manifest a physical presence. Beyond this island, they would become but wandering spirits, without form or substance.”<br><br>

              “Believe me when I tell you, that existence as a disembodied spirit is not a pleasant alternative. Still, more often than they would like, lucifer compels many of his minions to go forth from this place. They wander your Earth, to spread what influence they can, to beguile humanity, to lure them here, into the hands of their master. Nonetheless, they much prefer to remain here. To them, the world beyond is as a wasteland in which they find no rest.”<br><br>

              “I remember reading something like that in the Bible,” noted Serena.
              “Jesus was casting a whole group of demons out of some possessed man.
              The demons didn’t want to be cast out. They pleaded with Him to allow them to go into a herd of pigs, or something like that, rather than be sent out into the world. They had to be in some sort of living creatures, even a herd of pigs.”<br><br>

              “This is true,” said the angel. “Only their dedication to their master, and his purpose, would motivate them to travel from here and into the spiritual wilderness beyond. Yet, they have been at work here as well, doing their master’s bidding. Over time, they have desecrated this world, transformed it into a realm that better suited their needs. You see, even then, they knew that their efforts on Earth would be largely successful, that humans—such as your-self—would one day join them in their exile. They transformed their prison into a world of their own, into an empire that satan could rule.
              This empire became the place you know as Hell.”<br><br>

              “Then this is Hell?” asked Serena, her voice faltering.<br>
              “Yes, as far as the eye can see and beyond. This is but a small part of an island prison, lost in the vastness of the sea of nothingness. More than infinity separates it from everything you ever knew. It is a place from which there can be no escape.”<br><br>

              Serena was overwhelmed. A sea of nothingness beyond creation? An island prison, an inescapable prison, separated by more than infinity from all she had ever known? Her frightened mind refused to grasp the concept.
              To her, this angel was speaking in riddles.<br><br>

              Serena and the angel had reached the bottom of the stairway. Before them was a long, level corridor hewn from the surrounding gray rock. On either side of the corridor, were a multitude of small dismal cubicles, each closed off by a set of thick metal bars. From the cells that lined the corridor, Serena heard the pathetic whimpering and crying of many wretched souls.
              The mournful cries sent a chill through Serena’s soul.<br><br>

              The angel paused for a moment, pointing toward the corridor before them. “This is a temporary holding area, one of many, where some of those cast out from God’s presence await the pleasure of their new master.”<br>
              “And what will he do to these people?” asked Serena, who was only beginning to realize that she would soon be among them.
              “Do you really want to know?”<br>
              Serena only nodded.<br><br>

              “I cannot say what his specific plans are for you,” replied the angel, “but it is nothing pleasant, I can assure you. All I can tell you is that I was directed to bring you here, to this place, to await your sentencing.”
              “Directed by God?” asked Serena.<br><br>

              Only silence answered her question. Then she realized the answer. “No, it was that terrible dragon at the mouth of that portal of darkness, wasn’t it?
              He somehow told you to bring me here, didn’t he?”<br>
              The angel nodded.<br>
              “And you listened to him? Did what he asked?”<br>
              Again the angel nodded.<br>
              “But why? Answer me that.”<br>
              “Because that is the way God would have it,” replied the angel. “Satan and God are adversaries, but they are, as you might say, on speaking terms.
              There are agreements, arrangements made between them, even now.”
              “No way,” objected Serena. “How can that be?”<br>
              “It is, nonetheless, the case,” confirmed the angel. “Have you never heard the story of Job?”<br>
              Serena had heard of it many times, but had never actually read the Old Testament book. She knew the basic premise, however. The Book of Job tells how God allows the devil to afflict His faithful servant Job with all manner of curses to test his faithfulness to his Creator. Why? Because the devil had challenged God, claimed that if Job faced true adversity, he would not continue to be faithful to his Creator. By Serena’s way of thinking, it implied that God made a bet with the devil, at Job’s expense.<br><br>

              The angel continued. “Then you realize that there are lines of communication between the Creator and satan. Satan is, apparently, quite interested in you. The Father agreed to turn you over directly to him.”
              That sent a chill up Serena’s spine. “But why is satan interested in me?
              What am I to him?”<br><br>

              The angel’s answer was slow and deliberate, well rehearsed, as if he’d spoken it a thousand times. “Satan is interested in all of humanity. Satan’s envy, his hatred of God knows no limits, child, and it deepened with the passing of time. He cannot strike out at God directly, however he can vent his wrath upon that thing which God loves most deeply, humankind. That is his interest in your kind. However, in your case, his interest would seem to be even greater. You are to have a sentencing hearing before satan himself. I do not know why.”<br><br>

              “That isn’t normal?” asked Serena.<br>
              “No, it isn’t,” confirmed the angel. “Satan does not have the time to review the case of every human condemned to this place. Some of the lost are dealt with by his many minions who take them to their predetermined place of eternal punishment, there to become just another soul among billions. There is no hearing, no trial, only quick retribution. Still others are never found by his minions at all. They drift through outer darkness as disembodied spirits until the terrible Day of Judgment. For you to have been brought to this place tells me that satan has something special planned for you.”<br><br>

              “Then God has thrown me to the wolves. He put me exactly where satan wants me. He did it to all of the people here. He has played right into satan’s hands, given him what he wanted. I was delivered to the devil on a silver platter. How can a loving God condone such a thing?” Serena asked.
              The angel scowled. “God didn’t do this to you, you did this to yourself.
              God offered you a means of escape from this place, but you rejected it. By your own actions, your own rebellion, you chose to dwell in this place.”
              Again the angel looked down the corridor. “Come, we must get you to your cell. Time is short.”<br><br>

              Serena felt the firm grip of the angel’s hand on her shoulder. She considered resisting, but realized that it was futile. After all, where could she run, even if she did manage to evade him?<br>
              As she was ushered along down the corridor, she glanced into some of the cells. They were all the same, about 8 feet on a side. They contained neither beds nor chairs, and no comfort facilities of any kind. They held not so much as a rock to set upon. They were totally barren cubicles, and only a few were empty. There were men and women of all ages and races here, representing every region of the world. They cried out in many languages yet to a common theme, lamenting a life lost, and an opportunity gone forever.<br><br>

              “This place is like some sort of medieval dungeon,” Serena said.
              “Of course,” replied the angel. “Most of those who have occupied it are from times past. They were better able to relate to its architecture, and the dread it engendered. Your history is replete with such places. Satan knows this well, and has utilized it to prey upon your fears.”<br><br>

              Again, Serena gazed about this dreadful place, breathed in the atmosphere of gloom and despair, then looked at her hands, her feet. “I don’t get it, why does it all have to be so real? I mean, I’m dead, my body is probably laying in a morgue somewhere back on Earth.” She pinched herself, felt the tiny prick. “I have a heartbeat; I still feel; I have a body;<br>
              how can that all be? I’ve got to be nothing more than a disembodied spirit, a ghost.”<br><br>

              “Yes, this is all true,” confirmed the angel, “you would be no more than a disembodied spirit were it not for the mercy of God. It is God who has allowed you to retain a state of consciousness. He has given you the body you now inhabit, a body that, in appearance, is much like the one you possessed in life.”<br><br>

              “You also said that most of outer darkness was a zone of nothingness, right?”<br>
              “Yes, we traveled through it on our way to this place,” confirmed the angel. “Very little of it is otherwise.”<br>
              “But it just doesn’t make sense. God is supposed to be merciful, right?
              You said there were some souls that satan couldn’t find, souls that were allowed to drift free in outer darkness until the Day of Judgment. Wouldn’t it be more merciful to just leave me as a disembodied spirit, allow me to drift in this outer darkness of yours? At least I’d be at peace. Was I that bad, that sinful in my lifetime? Why give me a body that satan can torture, and then drop me off right at his doorstep?”<br>
              “Because it has been decided that this is how it shall be,” replied the angel. “That should be enough for you. Nonetheless, as I said, a countless number of spirits do drift through outer darkness, for it is a realm of spirits.
              Those spirits of the dead wander aimlessly through the abyss in a sort of dream state, a sleep that shall last until the day of their final judgment. They are hardly conscious of the darkness that engulfs them.”<br>
              “But not me.”<br>
              “No, not you,” continued the angel. “You are different from those who sleep. In this place you have retained a physical form. The body you seem to possess is similar in many ways to the one you possessed in life, yet in other ways, it is very different. If you are to remain conscious in this realm, you will need a physical form for the sake of your own sanity. God has provided you with that. All of your senses still function. In this new body, you can still enjoy the pleasures of eating and drinking, as well as the bliss of sleep. You can feel warmth and cold, pain and pleasure, sense the odors and tastes of the world around you, just as you did on Earth. God, in His wisdom, has given you this body to make the transition into the realm beyond life less traumatic, more akin to your Earthly experiences. Yet, unlike your Earthly body, this new body is incapable of a second death. No matter how severely it might be injured, it will mend, and do so with astonishing rapidity.<br><br>

              “In Heaven, these aspects of your new body would have become a blessing, but here, they are a curse. As to why you are here, I do not know. I do not understand why some sleep until their final judgment, while others are condemned to this place. I am not so bold as to question my Creator’s motives.” There was a moment of hesitation. “I did that once, but not again.
              Now, I exist to serve. I do what I am told, and no more.”<br><br>

              That last comment struck Serena as being quite odd. Yet, she did not feel at all inclined to probe into this angel’s relationship with God. No, right now, she had troubles enough of her own.<br><br>

              They passed two intersecting corridors, containing still more cells and more souls, whose eternal future held nothing but pain and remorse. These corridors seemed to extend for miles. Serena could only imagine how many people were awaiting their terrible fate in this place. Serena was startled by a loud mechanical clanking emanating from a cell to her right. As she watched, the crude cell door opened, making clear her entrance into the small chamber.<br><br>

              The angel motioned toward the empty cubical. “You will enter your cell now, my child.”<br>
              Serena couldn’t seem to resist the angel’s voice, and quietly walked into the small enclave. The massive cell door closed behind her, locking her in.
              The angel turned to depart.<br>
              “Wait,” pleaded Serena, moving to the bars of her cell. “Do you have to leave right now?”<br>
              “What would be accomplished if I remained?” he asked. “It is not within my power to intervene when satan’s minions come for you. Over the years, so many of your kind have pleaded with me to do just that.”<br>
              “Please, that’s not the reason,” replied Serena. “Could I at least know your name? Angels do have names don’t they?”<br>
              The angel turned toward Serena, his expression spoke of his curiosity regarding the nature of her question. “Yes, child, I have a name. It was given to me by God Himself. I am Aaron.”<br>
              “When this is all over, you will be going back to Heaven, won’t you?”
              “Yes,” replied Aaron.<br>
              “Aaron, I would be eternally grateful if you would carry a last message from me to my husband.”<br>
              Aaron looked at the young woman incredulously. “Child, you don’t have a husband. This thing you must accept.”<br>
              Serena caressed the golden band about her finger. “Aaron, I wish to differ with you. I do have a husband.”<br>
              “Not in the sight of God,” Aaron said, who at this point felt the need to depart. “That is the standard I must uphold. You have become a non-entity.
              All memory of your existence has faded from Heaven and Earth. The relationship you shared with this man, this son of God, no matter how real it may seem to you, does not exist.”<br><br>

              “No,” insisted Serena, pointing defiantly to her heart. “It exists here.
              The love we shared is not dead so long as it still dwells within me. Nothing can take that away.”<br><br>

              “I do not wish to be cruel,” Aaron said, “please understand. But you must face facts. You do not yet comprehend the relentless agonies of Hell, and what they shall do to you. In a tragically short time, this love you speak of will be ripped from your heart. In the end, this place will leave you with little more than your most primal animal instincts.”<br><br>

              “All the more reason for me to give you this message now, while the love within me still lives,” insisted Serena.
              “You understand that Chris will have no recollection of you, or the love you shared,” said Aaron. “Even if I approached him and spoke of you, which I may not, it would mean nothing to him.”<br><br>

              “But perhaps, someday, he will remember,” replied Serena, tears welling up in her eyes. “I know I will never see him again. I will never get out of here. But you might see him, and if one day, by some miracle he remembers the love we shared, I want to entrust you with a message for him. Will you be able to remember it?”<br><br>

              Aaron smiled slightly. He knew the utter futility of this poor woman’s hopes. Nonetheless, he would humor her. It seemed the most humane course of action. “I remember every word I have ever heard. What would you have me tell him, child?”<br><br>

              “Tell Chris that I’m so sorry that I can’t be with him now. For the first time I’m beginning to realize the true extent of his love for me. He tried so hard to get me to believe, to get me to accept Jesus as my personal Lord and Savior. He wanted so much for us to be together in paradise, for eternity. He wanted to save me from this.”<br><br>

              Serena hesitated, wiping the tears from her eyes. “Tell him that it’s not his fault that I’m here, its mine. Though we might be separated for eternity, my love for him will never die, not ever. But I don’t want him to mourn for me. I want him to remember us as we were, in the stone house in Oregon. I want him to remember how wonderful life was. Tell him not to think of me as being here.”<br><br>

              Serena turned from the bars. “God, maybe it’s better if he doesn’t remember me.” She leaned against the cold stones of the back wall of her cell, weeping softly.<br><br>

              Aaron said nothing.<br>
              It was over a minute before Serena turned away from the wall. She was surprised to find Aaron still there, his eyes full of sympathy.<br>
              “I’m sorry to make such a scene,” said Serena, walking toward the bars.
              She extended her hand between the bars.<br><br>

              Aaron took her hand in his. “It’s all right, child, I understand. I promise that if one day Chris does remember you and the love you shared, if he does seek me out, I will tell him all that you have told me. I will speak of your courage, and of your love for him. After all, our God is a God of miracles.”
              “Thank you,” replied Serena, as their hands parted. “Goodbye Aaron.”<br><br>

              Aaron only nodded as he turned to leave. As he walked down the corridor he reflected upon the fate of this poor soul left behind. A single tear welled up in his right eye. How he wished things could have been different.
              Serena stood by the bars, watching Aaron walking away until she could see him no longer. She wondered just how much time remained before the demons would come for her.<br><br>

              “Hello,” came a greeting from the other side of the corridor.
              Serena turned to see the man in the cell across from hers. Amidst the intense emotions of the moment, he had gone unnoticed.<br>
              “Hello,” she said, not quite sure what else to say.<br>
              The slender middle-aged man walked up to the bars of his cell. His dark eyes focused upon his comely companion across the corridor. His gray business suit was wrinkled and dusty. The top several buttons of his white shirt were open, and his black tie hung loosely from his neck. From his appearance and accent, Serena figured him to be of Indian descent.<br>
              “You are from my time aren’t you, 2007?”<br><br>
              What a strange comment. At first, Serena didn’t understand what this man was talking about. Then she glanced at her medieval attire. She managed the slightest of smiles. “Yes, I’m from 2007. I mean that’s when I, well, died.” She realized that her statement was no less strange than that of her companion. She’d have to learn to think in entirely different terms here.
              “I’d been at a banquet, an ARS banquet, just before I died.”<br><br>

              “Oh, the American Renaissance Society, I’ve heard of it. Interesting organization,” replied the dark-skinned man, nodding his head. He paused, apparently searching for the right words. “I couldn’t help but overhear your conversation with the angel,” he continued, in a soft voice. “I’m sorry for your loss.” He reconsidered his words. “Or is it a separation? How indeed do you define our situation?”<br><br>

              “A nightmare,” Serena said.<br>
              “Yes,” confirmed the man, “would that it were that simple. I fear, however, that this is no simple nightmare. It is a reality beyond the veil of death, a reality that, I must admit, I was not quite prepared for.” The man paused. “Oh, but forgive me, I have not introduced myself. My name is Nari Patel, but all of my friends call me Benny.”<br><br>

              “I’m Serena Davis. That’s who I am, really. But they insist that I’m actually Serena Farnsworth. Farnsworth was my maiden name, you see. I guess they’ve annulled my marriage, or something like that. I remember my husband, but he doesn’t remember me. That’s what they tell me. I guess he doesn’t love me anymore either. How can you love someone who doesn’t exist for you?”<br><br>

              Serena’s words had taken on the rambling, disoriented aspect of one whose mind was teetering on the brink of a terrible precipice. She felt so helpless.<br><br>

              “Yes, I heard,” replied Benny, his tone soft and understanding. “It’s terrible what has happened to you. I only wish that I had some words of wisdom, something that might help.”<br><br>

              Serena couldn’t continue on with this subject. “How long have you been here, Benny?”<br><br>

              “I’m really not sure,” Benny said, fully understanding why his companion had changed the course of their discussion. “Long enough to have become very hungry and very thirsty. Room service here is not so good, in fact, it’s nonexistent. It has been, perhaps, two days. When I arrived, this place was mostly empty, but many people have been brought in since then, I think.”<br><br>

              “It’s almost full now,” Serena said.<br>
              “Then, perhaps, it will not be long before something happens,” noted Benny. “I don’t know if that’s good or bad.”<br>
              “I don’t think its good,” said Serena. “Benny, how did you come to be here?”<br><br>
              “I think the simple answer is that I died.” Benny did his best to add some levity to their situation. It didn’t work. “I’m sorry, Serena, I know it’s not a laughing matter.”<br><br>

              “It’s OK.”<br>
              Benny nodded. “Yes, let me start again. I think I got off to a bad start. I guess it all boils down to this; I hadn’t put my faith in Jesus, the Christian’s Savior. That is what I was told at my judgment. I did my best to put up a good defense at my trial. I explained that I had little exposure to the faith of Christianity until I came to your country. It really isn’t a major religion in my native India. How was I to know that it was the correct faith, the only faith? Now I’m here, separated from my wife and children forever, and for what? How was I supposed to know? Tell me that.”<br><br>

              Benny turned from the bars and walked to the back of his small cell.
              There was a long silence.<br>
              “Benny, are you OK?” asked Serena, fully realizing after she said it, that no one here could truly be OK.<br>
              “No, I don’t think so,” Benny said with a trace of anger in his voice.
              “Look, I don’t claim to have lived a perfect life, I certainly had my faults. I have a temper for one thing, I admit it; but I do my best to control it. I’ve never touched my wife, or my children, in any manner other than a loving one. I’ve been known to twist the truth now and again, especially with the IRS. But I’m not a thief, a murderer, or an adulterer. I’ve done my best to teach my children right from wrong. I think I did a pretty good job of it.”
              Benny returned toward the bars, his face was flushed.<br><br>

              “So, at 47, in my office at Motorola, I have a massive heart attack. They rush me to the hospital, but I never make it there. I find myself sitting along the freeway, the pain is gone, and so is the ambulance. I try to wave down a car or two but it doesn’t work; no one sees me. Suddenly this dark vortex appears right in front of me. I didn’t want to go into it, but I couldn’t stop myself.”<br><br>

              “It was like that for me, too,” Serena said.<br>
              “It took you to that huge arena?”<br>
              Serena nodded.<br><br>

              “Well, I’m here to tell you, that after that wild ride through that vortex, I was pretty disoriented. I wasn’t at my best during my judgment. Still, I wonder if there was anything I could have said there that would have made a difference.”<br><br>

              Benny’s train of thought was interrupted as an angel marched down the corridor, with a squirming youth in his arms. The young man appeared to be about 16 or 17 years old and was dressed in a white tee shirt and black baggy pants. He was struggling wildly and crying loudly. Neither Benny nor Serena understood what the young man was yelling, it sounded like he was speaking Spanish. His voice faded slowly into the distance. The whole experience sent a chill up Serena’s spine.<br><br>

              Benny shook his head sadly. “I’ve seen a lot of that sort of thing in the past two days. Not everyone goes quietly. It goes on constantly, night and day. That is, if there is a night or day here.”<br><br>

              “It’s so unfair,” said Serena, her voice quivering ever so slightly. “How were we to know?”<br><br>

              “I know,” said Benny, his voice soft and understanding. “I wish I could tell my wife and children about what lies beyond death. I want to warn them, to tell them what they need to do to avoid what has happened to me, to us.”<br><br>

              “There’s a parable in the Bible that’s sort of like that,” Serena said. “It’s about a wealthy man and a poor beggar named Lazarus. The wealthy man had it easy in life. He lived in the lap of luxury. In his day-to-day affairs, he barely took notice of the poor leper. But then, both the wealthy man and Lazarus died. Lazarus went to his reward in Heaven, but the rich man was sentenced to eternity in Hell. The rich man was very thirsty, he begged for a drink from a nearby angel, but was refused. Then he saw Lazarus, far off in Heaven. He begged that if Lazarus could just dip his finger in a cup of water and place a single drop on his tongue, he would be eternally grateful.
              But the angel told him that there was a great void between him and Lazarus that could not be bridged. Then the rich man asked the angel to go back to Earth on his behalf, and warn his brothers of the terrible fate that might lie ahead of them if they didn’t mend their ways. But the angel told him that his brothers had the words of the prophets to warn them of what might lay ahead. If they didn’t heed the prophets, why should they heed a message from beyond the grave?”<br><br>

              “But there have been so many people who claimed to be prophets,” objected Benny. “So many of them preached conflicting messages, how were we supposed to know which ones to believe?”<br><br>

              “My husband used to say something about the sheep recognizing the shepherd’s voice, or something like that. I’m not the person to ask about such things. After all, I’m here with you. I sure didn’t recognize the shepherd’s voice.”<br><br>

              “One thing did truly frustrate me at my trial,” complained Benny. “God spoke of my shortcomings, my ‘sins’ as He called them. Apparently any sins, anything we did wrong, made us unacceptable. Without accepting Jesus, we were pretty much done for. He demanded that I be taken from His sight and into outer darkness, there to dwell with satan and his angels forever.”<br><br>

              “I just don’t see how my sins compare to those of satan. If I understand Christianity correctly, satan actually challenged God’s power, went to war with Him.” Benny stepped back and spread his arms. “Picture this, Serena, the rogue’s gallery of history, enemies of God and humanity. We have Nero of Rome, who horribly and sadistically killed tens of thousands of Christians in the Circus Maximus, in the name of entertainment. We have Adolph Hitler, author of the holocaust, the murderer of six million Jews in the death camps. There’s Miguel de Torquemada, who tortured to death thousands during the Spanish Inquisition. Oh, excuse me; he tortured them in the name of God, so that’s OK. Perhaps he is not here at all. And last but not least, we have Benny Patel, who knowingly cheated on his taxes. All are sentenced to the pains of Hell for all eternity. What is wrong with this picture? Am I missing something here?”<br><br>

              His odd discourse might have been mildly amusing, had it not been so very tragic.<br>
              “Remember, I’m here too, Benny,” Serena said in a soft voice. “I’m as guilty, no, more guilty than you. I practiced witchcraft, dishonored my mother, worshiped a pagan goddess, and committed adultery. Then I refused to accept God’s salvation through Christ, because I had become so bitter and sarcastic about how the world had treated me that I couldn’t see God’s love. Maybe I got what I deserved. Maybe Hell should be my home.”<br><br>

              Benny lowered his arms. He felt so very small. His careless words had just made things all the worse. “I’m sorry, Serena.”<br><br>

              “I wonder what it’s going to be like,” said Serena, whose mind had already wandered elsewhere. “Hell; that is. Is it a lake of fire, a huge dungeon filled with cruel and ingenious devices of torture, or what?”<br><br>

              “I’m afraid we’re going to find out soon enough,” replied Benny, “There’s nothing we can do about that. Why should we continue to dwell on it? Let us agree to speak of it no further. Why don’t you tell me a little bit about yourself, Serena? I’d really like to get to know you better, even if we never meet again. Regardless of God’s judgment, I believe that anyone who loves her husband as deeply and sincerely as you do, is a person worth knowing.”<br><br>

              Serena smiled slightly. Right now, she was really thankful to have someone like Benny to keep her company. They both sat down on their cell floors and spoke of their lives—their aspirations and hopes, philosophies and attitudes, life and love, as if it still mattered. After a long time, they both curled up and fell asleep on the cold floor.<br><br>

              </p>


      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <!-- <p class="chapterTitle">The Vision</p> -->

              <p>
                CHRIS felt no fear as he boldly stepped into the glowing ethereal tunnel.
                Yet, for an instant, there was a sense of confusion; a sense that something was missing. He glanced at his right hand as if expecting to see something within it. It was empty. It wasn’t empty just a few seconds ago, he was certain of it. What had happened? The Earth behind him, and his life upon it, had become a blur. Why couldn’t he remember?<br><br>

                That wasn’t important right now. No, he would try to put all of that together later. Right now, he was positively overwhelmed by the vastness and beauty of this place. The light ahead of him was bright, and was becoming brighter by the second. It was magnificent. Yet, his eyes were easily adapting to the changing illumination.<br><br>

                He looked around and saw a cylindrical wall of gray clouds, slowly swirling. Here and there, diffused ribbons of light threaded their way through the billowing mists. He was convinced that he was witnessing the subtle glow from hidden bolts of lightning traveling through the depths of the clouds, yet they were not accompanied by any auditory sensation resembling thunder.<br><br>

                He looked down to discover what he already expected; there was absolutely nothing beneath his feet but empty space. He was floating free, weightless. But he experienced none of the vertigo that he certainly would have experienced had his earthly body been placed in the midst of such vastness.<br><br>

                He never cared much for flying. When the captain turned on the “fasten seatbelt” sign, and warned of impending turbulence, he was inevitably the first passenger to go for the little bag in the seat pocket in front of him. Yet, this time he had no problems at all. Actually, this flight was sort of fun.<br><br>

                Stranger still, there was no fear. The sense of indescribable love and peace that he had felt at the entrance to the tunnel was far greater now—it had become all encompassing. If these emotions could be transformed into a tangible entity, they were present within this tunnel. He knew that he was not alone, though he could see no one. He knew he was in good hands, so why worry? For now, he would simply enjoy the ride.<br><br>

                He looked around again, this time with a more analytical eye. How wide was this tunnel of light? He could hardly imagine. There were no points of reference. It was obviously much wider than the 10- or 12-foot portal he had entered just a minute ago. Perhaps it was a dozen miles across, maybe even wider than that. There was so much to take in.<br><br>

                He was in motion, of that much he was certain. He was being carried along by some sort of ethereal wind. He could feel it blowing around him. It was not unlike an earthly wind; yet, it was so much more. It was refreshing, even invigorating, and it seemed somehow alive. It was a crazy thought, but that was his impression of it; a living wind, the breath of God. He was like a sailing ship, carried by steady unerring breezes, to a distant and exotic port.
                What would that port, that final destination, be like? And how long would the journey take? He could only guess. He figured he had the time to spare.<br><br>

                Beyond the wind, there was no physical sense of acceleration or movement. Still, he was moving toward the light. He had no problem with that. Minutes passed and Chris settled in for the voyage, much as any passenger might do on a long trip. The light at the end of the tunnel was becoming brighter, even as the clouds around him were transformed from gray to white.<br><br>

                Looking at his hand, he discovered that he could see straight through it to the clouds beyond. “Weird,” he whispered, though he quickly realized that he could not hear his voice. No, he heard it only within his mind. This is so cool, he thought.<br><br>

                For a time, he didn’t know how long, he was transformed into a state of pure spirit, free from the limitations of any physical form. In this state of being, he felt indeed close to God. As far as he was concerned, he could have remained in this state forever.<br><br>

                Then, all too soon, physical reality returned. It materialized all around him in the form of a great white antechamber of glistening grandeur.
                Towering marble columns supported a ceiling of dazzling light, and beyond that, a soft white billowing mist extended as far as the eye could see. There was music too, the most wonderful music he had ever heard. It seemed to be coming from everywhere. Was it real, or was the music simply a manifestation that existed within his mind? He could not say for sure.<br><br>

                Then he beheld something more awe-inspiring than the architecture, more beautiful than the music. A man in a long white robe stood about 20 feet in front of him. Chris realized that this was the man he had seen at the end of the tunnel, the great luminary who radiated not only light but love.
                There had been no formal introduction, no band of angels gathered about Him, yet Chris knew Him from the instant he first saw Him. This man was Jesus. It should have been no great surprise; after all, He was the light of the world, and the light at the end of it.<br><br>

                He had the appearance of a man in His mid-30s, handsome and solidly built, with light brown hair and a well-trimmed beard. Even now, His form was practically radiant, yet it was His deep blue eyes that caught Chris’s attention. They were so kind, so very deep, they seemed to gaze into the very depths of Chris’s soul. His face held a loving smile as He looked at Chris. He stretched out His hands, revealing barely discernable scars on both wrists.<br><br>

                “Welcome home, Chris.”<br>
                Tears of joy welled up in Chris’s eyes as he stepped forward to embrace his Savior. After a moment, Jesus spoke again. “Chris, I need you to be of stout heart, for your trial is at hand. Like all men, you must stand before God to be judged.”<br><br>

                For a moment, Chris was fearful. He was not proud of everything he had done during the course of his life. How could he possibly stand before God?<br><br>

                “Don’t be afraid,” Jesus said, His tone and smile reassuring. “I bore the penalty for your sins already, your debt is paid, remember?” Jesus took Chris’s hand in His. “I know you Chris, better than you realize. For years you have placed your faith in me, placed your hand in mine, even as I now place mine in yours. Place your faith in me now, and lay your fears to rest.<br><br>

                You are in my hands, I assure you. I shall be by your side every minute of the trial.”<br>
                They walked side by side into the great judgment hall, a vast arena, surrounded by men and women robed in white. Chris took little note of his surroundings. There were many people here, yet Chris’s attention was drawn to the figure upon the white throne before him. It was a human figure, as bright as the sun, yet His radiance didn’t hurt his eyes.
                Instinctively, Chris knelt before the figure upon the throne. He was unsure as to whether it was proper to look into the face of God as he did; yet he could do nothing else. What he beheld was magnificent beyond description.<br><br>

                The being upon the throne appeared ageless, with no wrinkles or imperfections. Chris fully realized that, in this case, age was a meaningless concept. Chris remembered that God was a spirit, perhaps He only took on a familiar form for Chris, one that he could relate to.<br><br>

                The white-robed being was of enormous stature, and yet Chris was not as afraid as he thought he might have been. Yes, having Jesus at his side helped a lot, but the Being before him, the Creator of the universe, was the Creator of Jesus as well, the ultimate Father of all. He had so loved the world; that He had sent Jesus to redeem those who lived in it.<br><br>

                A white-robed angel, who stood before the throne, opened a large book.
                And in that moment, Chris beheld his life, amidst the blue mists of a divine vision. At first he was fearful, ashamed of what might be revealed, yet those things never appeared. He witnessed himself as a child praying the prayer of faith with his mother. He witnessed his own baptism at the church in Eugene, Oregon.<br><br>

                He’d had a little trouble on that day. He’d swallowed some water on the way up from the baptismal pool, and had choked on it off and on for the better part of a minute. It was definitely an embarrassing moment, and here it was for all to see. Had he heard traces of subdued mirth from the vast audience around him? He wasn’t sure, but he thought so. He looked nervously toward the angel who stood by the great book, their eyes met. He was surprised to see the expression of mild amusement upon the angel’s face. He was unsure as to whether that was a good or a bad sign.<br><br>

                Chris saw himself as a young man, proclaiming his faith in his Savior before his friends at school. He spoke boldly of God’s love to them. Some laughed at him, even made fun of him, but most listened. Yes, he had planted a seed in their hearts, more than he had thought. Some of those to whom he had spoken had gone on to accept the good news he had shared with them. This, too, was revealed in the vision.<br><br>

                The vision continued, and he witnessed happy times with his parents at their home, gatherings around the dinner table, in the back yard, in the park.
                There were so many happy memories.<br><br>

                A tear came to his eye as he saw himself praying with his mother in the hospital during her last days on Earth. Yes, there were some sad times, but nothing for which he should have felt ashamed. Somehow those things had been erased from the record. Somehow? He knew how, didn’t he? It was the blood of the Lamb, the blood of Jesus, shed on Calvary. The Bible spoke of the cleansing blood. Now Chris truly understood the meaning of those words. It had to have been the blood that had washed his sins from the record before him, the record that God now reviewed.<br><br>

                When the vision came to an end, and the time came to speak, Chris did not have to defend himself before the judgment seat, for it was Jesus who spoke in his behalf. He spoke of His love for Chris, of faithfulness, and devotion, of the debts He had already paid. When He had finished, God turned to the angel who stood before the judgment seat.<br><br>

                “Does the name of Christopher Alan Davis, appear in the Lamb’s Book of Life?” He asked.<br><br>

                There was a pause, a shuffling of pages that could not have lasted for more than a few seconds, yet, to Chris it seemed far longer.<br><br>

                “Yes, Lord,” replied the angel, pointing toward an entry made in the great volume before him, “his name appears in the book.”<br><br>

                God turned to Chris. There was a broad smile upon His countenance.
                “Well done, good and faithful servant, well done, my son. Enter into the eternal joy that I’ve prepared for you.”<br><br>

                “Thank you, Lord.” A tremendous weight had been lifted from his soul.
                Jesus bid Chris to rise. They walked together from the judgment hall, across the white marble floors of the outer courts.<br><br>

                “What now?” Chris asked Jesus. “I mean, where do we go from here?”
                Jesus stopped momentarily, looking into His companion’s eyes understandingly. He smiled broadly. “Where? That is totally up to you, Chris. A long journey lies ahead of you, as it does for all humanity. The end of life is not the end of man’s sojourn, far from it; it is but the beginning.
                The first steps in any journey are the most difficult and important ones.
                Those are the ones that you took on Earth. When you accepted Me into your heart, and as you followed Me throughout your life, you decided which direction your personal voyage would take you. You chose the narrow path.
                Too few people find it, for the world is full of cares and concerns that obscure the way. Though I offer to carry their burdens, most reject me.<br><br>

                For the wide highway that leads to destruction, to Hell, is so much easier to find and travel. They find the pleasures it offers along the way too sweet, too tempting to pass up. But you rejected the easy way; you searched out the narrow path. And it has taken you to the threshold of a wondrous land. You will learn much there, and along the way, you will grow in wisdom as well. God’s judgment and mine are now behind you. We are both very pleased with you.”<br><br>

                For a moment, Chris seemed confused, “Your judgment, Lord?”
                “Yes,” Jesus said. “Did you not know that judgment begins in the House of the Lord? For you, judgment is over; but for those who rejected my sacrifice, a final judgment is ahead for them, a judgment at the end of time.
                But don’t be afraid. Today, I have weighed you and the fruit of your faith in Me in the balance. I am very pleased with what you have accomplished. I am very pleased with you. You have fought the good fight. Now the road to eternity lies open before you.”<br><br>

                “Lord, I can never thank you enough for opening this road to Heaven for me. I wouldn’t have made it without you.”<br><br>

                “And you were worth the sacrifice,” replied Jesus, placing a compassionate hand upon the young man’s shoulder. “Our Father sent me into the world, that you might have everlasting life, that you might have communion with Him, as I do.”<br><br>

                “But now that I’m here, what do I do?” Chris asked.<br>
                Again Jesus smiled. “Continue the journey. You’ve done a pretty good job so far, stay the course. I urge you to get to know the Father better, love Him as He has loved you, and love those around you, even as God has loved you. These are the two greatest commandments that I gave you on Earth. Nothing has changed. It is the same in Heaven, as it was on Earth.
                You followed these commandments on Earth, and I am proud of you. Stay the course, Chris, let the love within you flow to all of those around you.”<br><br>

                Chris couldn’t help but smile at that comment. It meant a lot to him to hear it coming from Jesus. “Thank you, Lord.”<br><br>

                “But there is something else,” Jesus said, his tone somewhat more serious. “Chris, you need to stop worrying so much. Worry does not add so much as a minute to your life, or an inch to your height. Take one day at a time. Don’t worry about tomorrow because our Father has everything in control. But I know that you are still searching for a starting point, and I shall give it to you. From there the rest will be up to you.”<br><br>

                Jesus led Chris into the bright mists beyond the great pillars at the threshold of the outer court. For a moment, they seemed to be walking on air, yet it was neither scary nor confusing. After all, Chris was with Jesus.
                They walked a few seconds before they materialized on the grounds of a great mansion. The mansion sat in the middle of a rolling grassy lawn, interspersed with flowers of a variety of colors. They lent a pleasant odor to the cool air. Beyond the wide lawn, a forest of tall trees in full summer foliage surrounded the estate.<br><br>

                The mansion itself was of two-story, Southern antebellum architecture, with four grand white pillars supporting a wide porch in front. Several wooden chairs were scattered about the wide wooden porch, and across the arm of one of them was draped a partially completed knitting project. A single strand of yellow yarn ran from the chair and across the porch, ending in a somewhat dismembered ball near the front door of the house. Not far from the ball, a sleeping black cat was curled up, its head facing the two visitors.<br><br>

                Jesus motioned for Chris to proceed toward the house, and they walked toward the four wide steps leading to the front porch. They were nearly there when the cat opened one eye, then two, to inspect the approaching visitors. The cat stood up and moved toward them.<br><br>

                “No, wait,” Chris said. A look of astonishment was on his face as he gazed intently at the yellow eyed cat. “This is incredible! Ebbie?”<br><br>

                The cat’s ears perked up, and she came running straight to Chris. She purred loudly as she moved around Chris’s legs, the way she always had in life. There were tears of joy in his eyes as he picked her up and held her close. Her purring grew louder.<br><br>

                “It’s a miracle,” whispered Chris, with his head next to Ebbie’s.
                Chris remembered the last time he had held her, on that terrible spring evening. He had come home from a movie to find her lying along the road dying after being hit by a car. The cat that had brought him so much joy in his youth, the cat that had mourned with him at the passing of his mother, lay alone in the dark. Yet somehow that night, she had hung onto life, gripped it in her tiny paws until he had come home, if only to say good-bye one last time. She died in his arms that night.<br><br>

                The God who loved all of humanity had shown His loving mercy to a small ball of black fur, uniting them once more. Here, two good friends would never have to say good-bye again.<br><br>

                “Thank you,” Chris said, turning to Jesus.<br>
                “But, there is more,” Jesus said, motioning to the door.<br>
                Chris looked up to see a woman in a green print dress standing by the front door. “Mom?”<br>
                His mother, Jennifer, stood there in wide-eyed wonder. This was not the pale, weary woman he watched die in a hospital bed 12 years ago—she looked as she did when Chris was a child, young and full of life, no, even better than that, she looked positively angelic.<br><br>

                Jennifer came running across the porch, down the steps, and into a three-way embrace with her son and his cat. “Oh, Chris, I’ve missed you so much.”<br><br>

                Jesus stepped back to watch the happy reunion, a broad smile on His face. It was more than a minute before emotions subsided enough for words.<br><br>

                “Thank you, Lord,” Jennifer said. “Thank you for saving my son.”<br>
                “You taught him well, Jennifer,” replied Jesus. “I’m happy for the two of you.” Jesus turned to Chris. “Here is your starting point. I leave you with a beautiful mansion and wonderful company to share it with. I’m sure that the two of you have much to talk about.”<br><br>

                No, please stay for a while,” urged Jennifer. “I have a freshly baked apple pie cooling on the windowsill, all ready to eat. Please, Lord, join us.”
                Jesus smiled broadly. “How could I possibly refuse an offer like that?
                One of your wonderful pies and such excellent company are not easily turned down.”<br><br>

                The three friends, and their feline companion, retreated to the house.
                Inside, Chris discovered a mixture of old Southern-style furniture and modern conveniences. It was magnificent.<br><br>

                “Having been born and raised in Alabama, I always dreamed of having a home such as this,” said Jennifer, setting out slices of pie on three plates on the kitchen table for her son and special guest. She placed her arm around her son. “It’s so wonderful to have you here, still, I expected that I would go many more years before seeing you again. I wanted you to have a long life.” There was a moment of hesitation. “And what is it with those clothes? Have fashions changed that much while I’ve been gone?”<br><br>

                Chris laughed. “No, I joined an organization, a club. One of the things we do is help present renaissance fairs. We have a lot of dress-up events. I’d been at a banquet before, well, before I ended up here.”<br><br>

                Jennifer smiled. “My, your interests sure have changed. I seem to remember that you were not all that thrilled with the renaissance festival your dad and I took you to when you were growing up. You were bored.
                About the only thing that caught your interest was the food, especially that big turkey leg, and that Galileo tent show. Why the big change?”<br><br>

                “Oh,” said Chris. “I’m still not all that interested in it; but, you see, I met this special friend, who….”<br>
                “Yes, go on,” urged Jennifer.<br>
                The smile vanished from Chris’s face. “I don’t remember. I really don’t.
                It all seems so distant now, my life on Earth, that is. I know it was only just a few hours ago, but, right now, it seems like forever ago and a billion miles away. There is so much I don’t remember. That bothers me.” Chris turned to Jesus.<br><br>

                “Don’t be concerned, Chris, it is normal. It is part of our Father’s plan.
                You see, there are parts of your life on Earth, memories that could cause you pain here, things that you had no control over. Until you have the inner strength, the spiritual maturity, to face them, you will not remember them.
                Some things will come back to you over time, others will not.”<br><br>

                Chris had to think about that one for a moment. “I’m sorry, Lord, I don’t know that I totally understand.”<br><br>

                Jesus took Chris’s hand in His. “When I walked upon your Earth, I spoke to all who would hear my voice. I spoke to people around the dinner table, at the temple, even on the road. Many times, I addressed thousands, bringing to them the good news that there was hope of eternal life. They didn’t have to be separated from God anymore. They could come directly into His presence, commune with Him, even as I did. My heart went out to every one of them. I loved each and every one of them. I died for all of them, anyone who would accept and believe what I had to say. I showed all the way out of their sins, the way out of Hell. Do you understand?”<br>
                “Sure,” Chris said. “I heard and believed.”<br><br>

                “Yes,” confirmed Jesus, “you did, but many more did not. I knew the content of their hearts from the moment I saw them. I knew that many would not accept the good news, but I had to give it to them anyway. They had hardened their hearts. Even as I spoke to them, I knew what they would do. I loved them so much, but knew that they were on the road to eternal separation from our Father. Can you understand what that feels like?”<br><br>

                Chris nodded.<br>
                “I cannot tell you how many times I wept over that very thing. I didn’t desire for them to die in their sins, but even I, the Son of Man, was powerless to prevent it. What the Father has done for you is to spare you from this pain.”<br><br>

                “I think I understand now,” said Chris. “I’m not going to remember loved ones who are not coming here to Heaven, those sentenced to Hell.”<br><br>

                “That is true,” said Jesus. “Still, the time may come when you desire to know all that transpired during your life on Earth, that you might profit from the experience. That is a big step, and it can be painful. Most people never come to that point. They decide that they don’t really want to know. If that day does come for you, the knowledge is yours; our Father will not forbid it. You will know of those lost ones, but that knowledge will not stir within you the feelings that you had for them on Earth. You will be spared that pain. You will know of them without truly knowing them. Even still;
                that knowledge carries with it a burden. Do not enter into such a decision lightly. I believe that your mother has sought some of that knowledge in her short time here.”<br><br>

                “I have,” Jennifer said, “but only a little bit, and not for years. I had to know what was going on with my family, my son, back on Earth. But it can be painful; I found that out really quickly. Chris, honey, once you get to feeling just a bit more comfortable here, I’ll show you how. But get settled in here first. It’s an entirely different world; you need some guidance at first. My own grandparents were my guide, I will be yours.”<br><br>

                Chris was starting to feel a bit uncomfortable with this subject. He realized that there were many adjustments to make. “You know, I was just thinking, I didn’t realize that people ate food in Heaven. I didn’t think they needed to.”<br><br>

                “We really don’t,” Jennifer said. “But I suppose old habits are hard to break.”<br><br>

                “Especially when we are talking about your mother’s wonderful apple pies,” said Jesus. “During my time on Earth, the Pharisees often criticized Me because I loved a good meal, a good glass of wine, and the pleasant company that went along with it. Some called Me a glutton and a drunkard.
                There will always be those who will find fault with what we do. Many saints here in Heaven have abandoned eating because it is no longer necessary to sustain life. They wish to spend that extra time seeking a closer relationship with the Father. I understand their reasoning, but I have not given up the partaking of food. I have found that conversations held over a dinner table tend to be among the most sincere. That is when people are the most likely to open up to you.”<br><br>

                “My son will be well fed and well looked after here,” said Jennifer, a broad smile on her face. “I’ll see to that.”<br><br>

                Jesus glanced over at Jennifer. He laughed openly. “I’m quite certain of that.” Then he returned his gaze to Chris. “Your mother will take good care of you, now that you are here. She loves you very much. Listen to her Chris, consider all that she tells you, I know that her council will be sound.
                She has much to teach you.” There was a brief pause.<br><br>

                “But understand this; Heaven is not a final destination for humankind.
                In your modern era, you have places for the older members of your society, some call them rest homes, others rehabilitation centers. Heaven is not a place such as this. It is not simply a place of rest. As I told you before, your spiritual growth has just begun. Here, with a closer, more intimate relationship with the Father, you will grow greatly in knowledge and wisdom. You will develop God-given gifts that you cannot yet imagine.
                Many are called, but few are chosen. Chris, you are one of the chosen; that is why you are here. One day you and the other children of God living here, shall be called to God’s highest purposes.”<br><br>

                Now, Chris was really intrigued. “Which is?”<br>
                “One of my dearest servants, the one I personally called on the road to Damascus, told you a little bit about it in his letter to the Corinthians. He told you that you would judge the angels. It is a responsibility handed to you directly from the Father. You were created a little lower than the angels, but, in time, your wisdom and authority will far exceed theirs. For many here in Heaven, that is already true. Do you now see why satan and his minions hate you so much?”<br><br>

                “Yes,” replied Chris, “but I don’t think I ever really grasped it like I do now.”<br>
                “And as time passes, you will understand still more,” Jesus said.<br>
                “Another thing, and this is very important; God needs from you your love and devotion. Some people feel that the Father literally feeds on your adoration and worship. Your generation might say that He is on a power trip. Let me assure you that this is not the case, far from it. Understand how much the Father loves you. Most of you can not even comprehend the depth of that love. He needs you to love Him just as much as you possibly can, as He loves you. It is not so much for His benefit as it is for yours. Coming into an intimate relationship with the Father is critical if you are to grow in mind, wisdom, and power. You need to one day become as I am now, and you will, if you come to know the Father as I do.”<br><br>

                Chris was, to say the least, astonished. “Become like you?”<br>
                Jesus laughed openly. “Don’t be so surprised that I tell you this. It happens to be true. I have no doubt you will succeed. It takes much work and perseverance, but the results are well worth the effort. You will see.”
                Jesus rose from His chair, having finished the pie. “Thank you, Jennifer, that was wonderful. As I said, I have had many a pleasant and meaningful conversation over a good meal. I have enjoyed this one, but I must be on my way. Keep asking questions, Chris, don’t hesitate. That is how we grow spiritually.”<br><br>

                Jennifer and Chris accompanied Jesus to the door. It was then when Chris worked up the nerve to ask his last question.<br>
                “Lord, I suspect that there is something else, something that you are not telling us. What happens when we finally become like you? God has a plan for us, doesn’t He?”<br><br>

                Jesus turned to Chris. The twinkle in His eye, His broad smile was almost magical. “Yes.”<br><br>

                There was a moment of silence. It was Jennifer who pursued her son’s question. “And that would be what? I don’t know either.”<br><br>

                “Along the way to that goal, you will be given growing responsibilities.
                Some of you will reign with me over Earth for a thousand years. You will gain valuable experience.”<br><br>

                “And after that?” asked Chris.<br>
                Jesus walked about half way across the porch before turning once more.
                “That is a conversation for a later time. You are not as yet ready for that answer. But I will tell you this much; it will be challenging, yet glorious beyond your comprehension. When the time comes, you will be ready. My blessings on you both. We will speak again, many times, I promise you.”<br><br>

                Even as Jesus descended the stairs, a twinkling sphere of starlight appeared before Him. He stepped into the midst of it and quickly vanished.<br>
                “Wow,” was all Chris could say.<br><br>

                The remainder of the day was spent in touring the house and the grounds and talking. The house was truly enormous, with a formal dining room, five huge bedrooms, a well-equipped kitchen, and, of course, a sewing room. The house had the heavenly equivalent of electric lights and appliances, although there were no cords. Apparently, each had its own internal power supply.<br><br>

                “They were all here when I arrived,” explained Jennifer. “They have never failed, and the bulbs in the light fixtures have never burned out, not a single one of them. I suppose that’s a good thing, since I haven’t located any replacements if they did. Please, don’t ask me exactly how they work, I don’t know. I just accept it as a gift from God, and leave it at that. He has gone to great lengths to make me feel at home and comfortable.”<br><br>

                “But where is the TV?” joked Chris. “There are a lot of good programs on Saturday. I think the Trailblazers are playing at home tonight.”<br><br>

                “Sorry, Chris, didn’t I tell you that the tube wasn’t all that good for you.
                You need to get out more instead.”<br><br>

                Chris smiled. “Actually it isn’t really a tube anymore, Mom. I have a 40-inch plasma HD TV at home.”<br><br>

                “Oh,” Jennifer said, pondering what her son had just told her. “You have a plasma HD what?” <br><br>
                Chris laughed. “I guess I’ll have to bring you up to speed on what is going on back home.”<br><br>

                Chris and his mother had so much to tell each other. There were a lot of holes in Chris’s recollection of his life on Earth, especially during the last five years. That was indeed odd, but he tried not to allow it to trouble him.
                After all, Jesus Himself had said that such things were to be expected. The important thing was that he was here, he was thinking more clearly than at any other time in his life, and he had been reunited with his mother.<br><br>

                As day slowly faded, the fireflies lit up the lawn and the forest beyond.
                Chris and his mother watched it all from the porch swing, chit chatting the way they used to so long ago. How he had missed her since then.<br><br>

                “I wasn’t sure that there would be a night in Heaven,” said Chris, gazing out into the fading twilight.<br><br>

                “It all depends where in Heaven you are,” replied Jennifer. “We have day and night here, but they don’t in the City of Zion. There it is forever day. It always feels like early afternoon there, at least to me.”<br><br>
                “Zion?” asked Chris.<br>
                “Yes, I guess you could call it the capital city of Heaven, the dwelling place of God. It is really amazing, you’ll see. I’ll take you there in a few days, but I wanted you to get acclimated to your new home first.”<br><br>

                “OK, Mom,” said Chris, placing his head on her shoulder the way he used to as a young boy. “Whatever you say. Right now, I just want to stay home with you.”<br><br>

                Chris was greeted by a sky full of the brightest stars he had ever seen. It was several hours later when a feeling akin to tiredness began to overtake him. “It would seem that our bodies still need sleep,” he said, stretching out his arms wide.<br><br>

                “You think you do,” Jennifer said, “and sleep is a good thing, even here.
                You’re used to the cycle of sleep, so am I, even after all of these years. But, believe it or not, you could go on without it. Your glorified body really doesn’t need to sleep. There are people here who have matured completely past the need for sleep. Maybe we all will, with time. But for now, I still sleep, but not as much as I used to. I’ll take you to your room.”<br><br>

                Chris’s bedroom was on the first floor of the great mansion, a huge room that seemed immediately familiar. Within the walk-in closet, Chris found a complete wardrobe of clothes, everything he would need.<br><br>

                Following a good night kiss from his mother, he was ready for bed. He truly felt like a kid again, and he loved it. As he sat there alone on his grand bed, he took a moment to offer his thanks to God. So far, Heaven had met or exceeded all of his expectations. He could hardly wait to explore it in greater detail; and explore it he would, for he had all of the time in the universe.<br><br>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <!-- <p class="chapterTitle">The Vision</p> -->

            <p>
              SERENA tried her best to get some sleep. For a time, she dreamt of Chris, and the rock house in Oregon. In her dreams, she was lying in bed by his side, his arm wrapped around her. She could hear his gentle breathing, hear him call her name in the night, feel him gently caress her. Sadly, it was an illusion, a phantasm, a ghost of a time that would never be again. Her dreams were all too frequently interrupted by a commotion in the hallway, as yet another damned soul was ushered through to await their fate. The pattern of sleep and rude awakenings was repeated at least half a dozen times, before a different sort of disturbance caught Serena’s attention.<br><br>

              She rose to her feet to hear screams from somewhere far down the corridor. It was not just the screams of one or two individuals, but those of a great multitude. She stumbled to the bars of her cell to find out what was happening. The commotion had attracted Benny’s attention as well, for he already stood by the bars of his cell, doing his best to peer into the corridor beyond.<br><br>

              “Something’s happening,” he confirmed, turning to Serena. “This might be it.”<br><br>

              “Oh God!” gasped Serena, taking a step back. She knew this moment was coming. She had tried to prepare herself for it, but she realized now that she wasn’t ready for the reality. It was now. It was time.<br><br>

              If only she could get out of her damnable cell, run, hide, do something, anything but wait helplessly. She wrapped her hands around the cold metal bars in frustration, testing them a final time, with all too predictable results.<br><br>

              Serena turned away from the bars and paced back and forth several times. She wanted to pray, but God wasn’t listening, was He? Prayers were for Earth and Heaven, not this place. Nonetheless, she found herself on her knees.<br><br>

              “Lord, God, I know it’s too late for prayers, too late to plead for your mercy. If you’re listening, all I ask is that you give me the strength to face what is to come.” Serena hesitated before continuing. “Lord, look after my husband, Chris. I know that now he’s only my husband in my own mind, but please watch over him. Shower him with your love, even though I can’t.
              In Jesus’ name…”<br><br>
              
              Amen,” came the response from across the hallway.<br>
              Serena looked up to see Benny, his hands folded, his head bowed. He looked up, their eyes met.<br><br>
              “I know, it’s pointless,” he said. “But doesn’t it say somewhere, the day will come when every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord?”<br><br>

              “Yes, it does,” Serena said. “A strange time for us to realize it, isn’t it?”
              Benny nodded.<br><br>

              Serena turned toward the source of the commotion. “Do you think it’s getting closer?”<br><br>

              “Yes,” confirmed Benny. “But it might be some time before it gets here, whatever it is.”<br><br>

              “I hope I get to see you again,” said Serena. “You’ve made my time here more bearable. Thank you.”<br><br>

              “The honor has been all mine. It has been a privilege, and a pleasure, to be in your company.”<br><br>

              For a time, the two stood there in silence. Yes, the commotion was drawing nearer, and at a faster pace than either of them wanted. Whatever it was, its presence was beginning to permeate the cell block. The large glowing crystal protruding from the ceiling in the corridor just beyond Serena’s cell seemed to be changing. It was fading. Its previously blue white glow was acquiring a more somber amber hue. The stage was being set for them. Soon, very soon, the curtain would rise on the next act of tragedy. There was absolutely nothing they could do to stop it.<br><br>

              Minutes ticked by, measured only by Serena’s rapidly pounding heart and heightening fear. Again she peered into the hallway from her cell.
              Though nothing out of the ordinary met her eyes, a sudden terrible wailing from a nearby cell drove her back against the wall. She was shivering as she looked at Benny. He stood there stoically, facing the bars, arms at his side.
              He looked toward the source of the cries, then back to Serena; his eyes were kind and understanding. He whispered something, though Serena couldn’t hear it above the loud lamentations that apparently arose from the man in the cell next to hers.<br><br>

              ?uite abruptly the cries died away to a soft pitiful whimpering. Serena heard the poor man muttering something in an undecipherable tongue. She wasn’t sure what language it was, but the tone was unmistakable— indescribable terror.<br><br>

              The awful thing creeping down the hallway toward them had grown frighteningly close. Serena listened more carefully. There was another sound, though she couldn’t quite make it out. Perhaps it was the result of shifting winds sweeping through the corridors? No, it wasn’t that. It was a sort of screeching sound, like nothing she had ever heard. It reverberated from every wall, emanated from every quarter of the subterranean hallway.
              It authored even greater fear within Serena as it grew closer and louder.<br><br>

              Amidst the fading amber light, perhaps 20 feet down the corridor, she saw the swift movement of a nebulous dark form. No, not one, but many forms, swirling like black ragged cloth caught in an ethereal whirlwind, yet there was not the slightest breeze. In the midst of it, Serena was certain that she saw at least one pair of glowing orange eyes. She quickly retreated back to the wall, her heart pounding loudly. She wasn’t ready for this. She was frightened, nearly to the point of hysteria, yet she held her peace.<br><br>

              “Be brave, Serena,” Benny said, standing at the bars of his cell, gazing at her. It was becoming difficult to see him in the fading light. Even his voice seemed strangely distant. “You’re going to get through this. You’re a woman of courage, whether you realize it or not. I know you have it in you to face whatever is ahead.”<br><br>

              The whimpering from the next cell grew momentarily in volume, then faded completely.<br><br>

              In the corridor, black vapors swept past the bars obscuring the far wall from view, and then the entire hall vanished into the mists.
              “Benny?”<br>
              No answer.<br>
              “Benny?” she repeated loudly.<br><br>

              Still no response. But wait, she heard voices, deep and guttural. They seemed to be coming from everywhere and yet nowhere. They were too deep to be those of a human. Serena felt a chill as she realized that she had been somehow separated from all of the others in this place; left alone to face the unknown. Never in her life had she experienced such fear.<br><br>

              Again she heard a deep guttural voice. This time it was a single voice, one very close.<br><br>

              “Serena Farnsworth.”<br>
              Serena turned to see the dark hooded figure step toward the bars, materializing out of the mists. The being was tall, every bit as tall as the angel was. His body was cloaked in a jet black robe, his face veiled in shadows. Only his glowing amber eyes and the gaunt bony hands beyond the long, loose sleeves of his robe were visible.<br><br>

              He was the substance of a thousand nightmares. Serena felt the strong desire to scream, to release a portion of the terror penned up within her, but she managed to stifle it. She thought back once more to the Scriptures. The devil had the ability to appear as an angel of light. That might be convenient, in the event that he wished to beguile some foolish mortal with his beauty. But if that were the case, might he, or his minions, also appear as anything they wished? Might they take a more sinister form with the intent to invoke fear? Perhaps, but she wouldn’t yield to fear. If fear is what he wanted, it would be the last thing he would get. She did not back away from the thing; she stared it in the face, what little she could see of it.<br><br>

              “Yes, you are a pretty thing,” it continued, “in your own human sort of way. It would seem that God has discarded you, thrown you into the cold darkness, what a shame. But be not concerned, I have come to bring you to your new master. Yes, you should feel honored, for satan himself has summoned you. It is he who shall hear your case. This is a rare privilege.
              He shall not abandon you as God has; no, he will keep you throughout all eternity as one of his own. It is he who shall decide your fate, the precise nature of your punishment.”<br><br>

              “But first, you must be appropriately dressed for your meeting with your new master,” continued the dark being. A gray pile of cloth was pitched into Serena’s cell, catching her by surprise. “Remove the clothing you are wearing, and put those on. They are far more appropriate for what is to come, for your new station in existence. This garment is quite utilitarian.”<br><br>

              Serena hesitated; then cautiously reached out to examine the filthy garb that had been tossed at her. Its fabric was as coarse as burlap. There were two parts to her infernal wardrobe. One was a short, dirty skirt. The other was a halter top, tattered and roughly cut. They were disgusting. Serena considered refusing, resisting the demands of this demon, or whatever it was. Would that be an act of courage, defiance, or simple stupidity? Did courage or cowardice matter in this place?<br><br>

              The demon noted Serena’s hesitation. The tone of his response spoke of his amusement. “I see that I will have to encourage you to obey. So be it.”<br><br>

              ?uite suddenly, Serena’s dress began to yellow and disintegrate. Within seconds it had decomposed to decaying rags that fell from her body and became a pile of swirling ashes scattering across the floor. Even her shoes decomposed into dust at her feet. Serena turned from the dark being, trying to cover her nakedness.<br><br>

              “I am not the least bit interested in your body,” said the demon, his impatience obvious in his tone of voice. “Your form is disgusting to me, I assure you. You are an obscenity, a pale mirror image of the Creator, molded in flesh. Only He could be so egotistical. Now put those rags on— cover yourself, woman, before you make me ill.”<br><br>

              Serena reluctantly complied. Had she decided to obey out of her own human modesty, or had this thing somehow compelled her obedience? It was an outlandish thought, but she wasn’t so sure that it wasn’t true. After all, this was Hell, she’d have to get used to doing things, and experiencing things, that she didn’t like, and she’d be doing and experiencing them for all eternity. Her heart sank even more.<br><br>

              Serena picked up the tattered skirt, and stepped into the dirty, primitive garment, pulling it up around her hips. For a moment she was certain that it was too small for her, that it would rip, yet it molded itself to fit her perfectly; the uneven hem of the skirt was scandalously short, barely covering her intimate parts.<br><br>

              Then she picked up the top and slipped it over her head. Like the awful skirt, it too seemed initially too tight. Yet, as she pulled it on, it conformed to fit her perfectly. It was unnatural.<br><br>

              The fabric had a foul stench—a strong odor of decay and death. Serena felt ill in it. As much as she might have dreaded appearing before some sort of tribunal naked, it might well have been preferable to what she now wore.<br><br>

              Somewhere in the New Testament, she had read that our righteousness is as filthy rags before the Lord. She also recalled a parable about a man who came to the Lord’s banquet table in rags. When the Lord asked the man why he was dressed so, he had no excuse. That man had been bound and cast out into outer darkness, hadn’t he? Could those Scriptures have been alluding to this? She couldn’t say.<br><br>

              “Yes, better,” said the demon, scanning his victim carefully. “That garb is most unique. It will endure the harshest environments Hell has to offer, as you shall soon discover. In time, it will become almost a part of you.” It was then that his glowing eyes focused upon her hand. “Your wedding ring —remove it!”<br><br>

              The words hit Serena hard. “But it’s all I have left of my marriage, beyond the love I feel for Chris in my heart. Please, let me wear it. If there is any mercy within you, please let me keep this one thing.” Serena’s voice was faltering, pleading.<br><br>

              “You don’t have a husband, wench,” retorted the dark figure, his tone cruel and taunting. “This Son of God, of whom you dream, is only a husband of your lurid fantasies. You’re pathetic. Surely you must realize that you are not so much as a fading memory to him. Even if you were, why would he desire the likes of you? You’re a whore, unclean, nothing more than fuel for the eternal flames of Hell.”<br><br>

              A slight chuckle emanated from the dark form. “Ah, alas, you have not so much as a single mourner. In the end, none beyond this place will so much as remember that you ever existed. But we shall not forget you. We shall see to it that you receive everything that is coming to you. Now, remove the ring!”<br><br>

              Tears appeared in Serena’s eyes as she reached for the band of gold. The tears had turned to sobs by the time the ring cleared her finger and fell to the floor. She heard the clink as the ring hit the stone. Such a cold sound, and with its last reverberation, her previous life vanished into the mists of the dead past.<br><br>

              “Much better,” commented the dark being.<br><br>
              There was a loud clank, as a pair of jet black manacles connected together by a short, but formidable chain, struck the floor at Serena’s feet.
              They appeared heavy and crude, the sort of thing that one might have seen upon an Earthly prisoner of the distant past.<br><br>

              “These shall be the bands you wear now. Pick them up, wench!”
              commanded the shadowy form beyond the bars. “They will fit about your wrists, restraining your hands behind your back. Now, get them on!”<br><br>

              Serena whimpered as she picked up the manacles. Examining them more closely, she discovered that while the outside surface of the manacles were smooth, the inside surface, that which would be in contact with her skin, was brutally rough, covered with tiny needle-sharp barbs. Yet, the manacles appeared to have no locking mechanism, or even a catch to hold them shut around her wrists.<br><br>

              “If you continue to delay, wench, I promise that I will make this all the more uncomfortable for you,” said the demonic being. “Believe me; you don’t want to know just how uncomfortable things can get.”<br><br>

              Serena placed one of the manacles about her left wrist and began to close it carefully. It was obvious that it would be very tight when completely closed. The two halves had nearly met when the thing seemed to suddenly come alive. Snapping shut as if powerfully magnetized. She winced in pain as the metal barbs dug into her flesh.<br><br>

              The meeting point of the two halves of the manacle became momentarily red hot. Serena cried out in pain as she saw a cloud of smoke and heard the sound and smell of sizzling flesh seep from beneath the glowing irons. She struggled to control herself, to stifle her screams, but to no avail. The cell reverberated with her cries of agony. After a moment the glow and the pain faded, to reveal a single band of uninterrupted metal wrapped tightly around her wrist.<br><br>

              “Place your hands behind your back, and place the other manacle around your right wrist,” commanded the dark being.<br><br>

              Serena looked toward the demon incredulously. After experiencing that pain, how could she willingly submit to it again? The answer came more swiftly than she could have imagined, as she was struck by crippling stomach cramps.<br><br>

              “Do we really have to continue with this, or are you going to obey?” the dark being asked.<br><br>

              Almost without thinking, Serena thrust her arms behind her back and searched blindly for the open manacle. All the while the terrible pain in her stomach intensified. She had fallen to her knees now, struggling to thrust her right wrist into the remaining open manacle. Her animal instincts had taken control, as she sought for any means to escape the horrible pain wrenching in her gut. The sharp bite around her right wrist, followed by the agonizing heat, told her that she had succeeded. The pain in her stomach vanished, replaced by a new agony.<br><br>

              Serena twisted and stretched her arms as far behind her as she could in an attempt to move the red hot manacle away from her bare back. Tears streamed from her eyes, and she gasped pathetically as the searing pain exploded her senses. Never had she experienced such agony. By the time the manacle had begun to cool, her body was drenched in perspiration, and her face in tears. She could only imagine what her damaged wrists looked like.<br><br>

              “Very good,” said the dark form, drawing closer. “You’re a relatively smart wench; I thought you’d see reason eventually.”<br><br>

              For the first time Serena saw his face. It was gaunt and terribly thin, with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes. It was like the face of a corpse with a devious smile. ?uite unexpectedly, the door to her cell swung open wide.<br><br>

              “Rise,” commanded the dark being, extending a slender arm in her direction. “Your audience with the master, your sentencing, is at hand.”<br><br>

              With difficulty, Serena rose on unsteady legs, and nearly stumbled from the cell into the misty corridor. She saw that Benny’s cell was empty and the corridor was quiet; everyone was gone. How could this be? Had that much time passed?<br><br>

              “Where are the others?” she asked.<br>
              The dark being scowled, “Who do you think you are? No one here owes you any answers. Now, move!”<br><br>

              Serena was grabbed roughly and pulled toward her captor. She felt cruel hands and cold metal around her throat as a heavy black collar was thrust around her neck, a long chain trailing from the front. She was almost relieved when she heard the metallic click of the latch as the collar locked into place. There was no glowing metal, no searing heat to fuse the band together, only a conventional lock. She felt a hard tug on the chain as she was quickly dragged down the corridor by the tall hooded figure, past row after row of empty cells.<br><br>

              A swirling vortex of deepest crimson materialized before them. She tried to pull away, but it was a futile gesture. The dark hooded figure before her seemed to dematerialize at the threshold of this other worldly tunnel, flowing into the turbulent corridor, like a curling black mist caught up by a whirlwind. An instant later, Serena was jerked by the neck chain into the highly charged environment of the vortex. She was swept off her feet by gale force winds, even as cold, blue electricity arced around her. In this turbulent tunnel of elemental force, she discovered a new definition of pain.
              She felt the electricity coursing through her body and experienced the terrible nausea.<br><br>

              She prayed for an end of it, but it seemed to go on and on, carrying her through swirling clouds of kaleidoscopic vapors, whose icy touch made the coldest winter wind feel balmy by comparison. Then there was blackness, the deepest and most profound night she had ever experienced.<br><br>

              Through it all, the chain linked to the collar around her neck stretched out before her, glowing and pulsing with static electricity—extending into infinity. Though she could no longer see the dark being at the other end, his presence was betrayed by the tautness of the chain and the irresistible force that propelled her onward, viciously choking her.<br><br>

              Ahead, a faint point of light materialized like a dim star amidst the inky blackness of the void. It was becoming larger and brighter by the second. It grew to become a portal of light, perhaps a way out. She felt a sense of abrupt deceleration, then falling.<br><br>

              Serena slammed face first into the hard stone floor. With her hands chained behind her back, there was no way for her to break her fall. She lay on the cold floor, unable to move. She was still in pain, but thankful to be out of the horrible vortex.<br><br>

              After a moment, she lifted her head and looked around. The floor was shimmering black marble, reflecting the amber light of the hundred blazing torches mounted along the gray stone block walls. Hanging from the walls were large, intricate tapestries depicting dark skies with swarms of demons, terrible astral battles between great armies of angels, and grotesque acts of mayhem and torture. Serena was certain that the tapestries told some sort of story. Perhaps it was a pictorial account of the fall from Heaven.<br><br>

              Standing near the fringes of the room was a great throng of beings with an astonishing variety of forms. There were horned demons with bat-like wings, small and muscular imps with barbed tails and sharp horns, while still others looked like tall, pale women with cloven feet and claw-like hands. It was a nightmarish company whose presence brought terror to Serena’s soul.<br><br>

              She turned her attention from the motley crew of bipeds and strained to look behind her. She saw a large ring of metal that looked to be made of copper or brass. It stood upright upon a finely fashioned golden support.
              Through the open ring, Serena saw not the wall beyond, but blackness, a void of infinite depth, the void of outer darkness. Around the inner edge of the ring, Serena could see an occasional arc of blue lightning. It was a gateway, most likely the means through which she had entered this chamber of nightmares.<br><br>

              Serena turned her head to look forward. The dark figure stood before her, her chain in his hand. Several yards beyond him, three wide marble steps led up to a large platform, covered by a crimson red carpet. At the center of the grand stage was an ornate golden throne, whose dollar value on Earth would surely have been incalculable. Upon the throne sat a tall figure draped in deep blue velvet. In his hand he held a golden scepter, upon the end of which was a finely cut, fist-sized gem, with a center that glowed with a crimson light. Serena felt a terrible chill in his presence. It didn’t take a theological scholar to realize who was seated before her.<br><br>

              She had heard much speculation over the years regarding the devil’s appearance; red suit, horns, cloven feet, and a forked tail, were among a few of the features traditionally attributed to him. Yet the appearance of this prince of darkness was not quite what she had expected. He was as tall as the angels, yet his physical appearance was far more akin to that of a human male. He was in all aspects well proportioned, moderately muscular, and his flowing dark hair bore just the trace of gray around his temples. His eyes were brown, and his tan skin was flawlessly smooth without wrinkles.<br><br>

              Had she not known better, Serena might have guessed his age as early forties. The only traditional aspect of his appearance was his small dark goatee. All in all, he was darkly handsome. In fact, Serena was certain that he was the most handsome man she had ever seen. He had a powerful animal magnetism that any woman would have found most difficult to resist. Perhaps that was his intent.<br><br>

              Yet, beyond his physical appearance, he projected a regal bearing—a confidence in his authority and power, all without saying a word. Now, he was scanning the woman before him very carefully. He seemed to like what he saw. Serena resolved to be careful about what she said and did before the prince of darkness. How she conducted herself here could have far-reaching consequences. This being held her destiny, indeed her eternity, within his hands. Perhaps, just perhaps, he might be inclined to be merciful if he liked her.<br><br>

              Satan rose to his feet and took several steps in Serena’s direction. The dark figure holding her chain moved toward Serena. “Kneel before the master!” he commanded, roughly pulling Serena by her collar, lifting her from the floor, forcing her into a kneeling position facing the prince. She winced in pain.<br><br>

              “Gently, Marlock,” instructed satan, who brushed the bottom of his goatee with the index finger of his left hand. “We don’t wish to damage her, at least not yet.” Satan turned his attention to a dark robed figure to his left, one who stood at the bottom of the steps, holding a thick black book in his hand. “Now, who do we have here?”<br><br>

              “Her name is Serena Farnsworth, my Lord,” was the reply.<br>
              “And what were her sins?” continued satan, looking back toward Serena. “Why is it that the Most High God condemned this woman to outer darkness, relegating her into our custody?”<br><br>

              “Her sins are many indeed,” assured the hooded figure, “adultery, fornication, dishonoring her father and mother, and worshiping pagan gods, even as she took the Lord God’s name in vain. Yet her sins did not end there, they also included theft, bearing false witness against her neighbor, idolatry, fortune telling, witchcraft, and the sexually deviant act of lesbianism.”<br><br>

              Lesbianism? Serena felt like raising an objection over that one. It had only happened once, and afterward, she had very much wished it hadn’t happened at all. It had been an incident that had taken place in her darkest and most confused days. But what could she say of the other charges? They were all true. She kept her head bowed; deciding that not looking directly into the face of this megalomaniac might earn her some points.<br><br>

              “An impressive list for one so young,” satan said, taking a better look at the bound woman before him. “Yes, you have certainly earned for yourself a place in my kingdom, doomed to partake in the eternal cycle of agony and despair that is mine alone to bestow. The only question is, exactly how shall I deal with you? With so very many agonizing possibilities; what form shall your destiny take?”<br><br>

              Serena glanced up momentarily. She searched for the right words, anything that might help her case, yet she could find none. Perhaps what was to happen was inevitable, perhaps nothing she said would make a difference.<br><br>

              There was a sudden twinkle in the dark lord’s eyes. “Ah yes, of course, I know how I shall deal with you, Miss Farnsworth. Still, it is customary that I listen to the groveling and pleading of my guests before I pass sentence upon them. Do you have any last words, before judgment is passed upon you? Think carefully, for this opportunity shall never come your way again.”<br><br>

              Serena felt ill to her stomach. There would be nothing she could do to lessen her sentence, she knew that now. She could cry, she could beg for mercy, but it wouldn’t help. The words that came out of her mouth surprised even her. “Sir, if you please, I would like very much to ask a question before these proceedings continue.”<br><br>

              There was a twinkle in satan’s eye. Most people who knelt before him were too terrified to speak beyond a few groveling pleas for mercy, but not this one.<br><br>

              “Ask what you will, I am listening.”<br>
              “Thank you, sir,” Serena said in the most sincere tone she could muster.
              “I don’t understand why you are doing this. The same God that banished you to outer darkness did it to me as well. Why do you have to torture me?
              It seems like we have something in common.”<br><br>

              Satan couldn’t help but laugh at that remark. It was a bold comment.
              He’d heard that line before, but rarely so eloquently spoken. “Do you really think that you can compare yourself to me in the same sentence?”<br><br>

              Serena knew that she was on very thin ice. It was all too clear, that this being could make her eternity here far worse, if he was inclined to do so.
              She thought about the attributes that the Bible ascribed to satan. She did her best to appeal to those.<br><br>

              “I wouldn’t be so bold as to compare myself to you, sir. I mean, I admire what you’ve accomplished. You’ve become the master of outer darkness, brought order to chaos. Surely, only a great leader could have done all of this. Why torture humanity? If we’re all outcasts, why can’t we work together to create a wonderful new world, one where you are the master—revered, honored, even loved by a grateful people?”<br><br>

              Satan began to smile. He was so weary of listening to pleas for mercy, hearing about the problems and sorrows of these worthless humans, problems that he was about to greatly compound. But this one, on the threshold of her eternal torment, wanted to talk about him. He was impressed with this female. “You’re very perceptive, little one. When the Great God cast my minions and me into outer darkness, this place was a vast realm of nothingness, an empty void, but a void awaiting the hand of creativity to transform it into something greater. I became the god of this new realm, and I fashioned it into a form that served my needs.”<br><br>

              The smile dissolved from satan’s face at the very thought of his arch nemesis. “God, the Creator was a tinkerer, nothing more. He played endless games with the universe. He was like a child with a grand creation that He had fabricated with His new set of building blocks. It was so intricate, so vast, so perfectly balanced. He wanted everyone to see it. Yet He was alone, there was no one else to appreciate the work of His hand. He desperately needed to be praised for his accomplishments. He needed to know that what He had done was good, that He was good.”<br><br>

              Satan paused momentarily. Silence fell upon the audience chamber.
              Even the other beings there became still in his moment of contemplation.
              The dark prince looked upward for a moment. His eyes took on a distant stare. Serena’s nervousness grew. She wondered if she might have asked the wrong question.<br><br>

              “He loves praise,” continued satan, looking once more toward Serena.
              “Did you know that? That is why He fashioned the angels, not merely to be laborers and messengers, not even to be His companions, to deliver Him from loneliness. No, He needed sentient beings who would proclaim His greatness. He created me to lead the other angels in that praise. Though, in time, I came to question why we did this thing, I did my job with consummate perfection. Day and night, we fed an ego as big as the universe itself, but that wasn’t enough, He needed more. After a time, He decided that our worship wasn’t what He wanted at all. Understand this; we were created with all of the knowledge God saw fit to give us, and we worshiped Him because He created us to do just that. It was our function. We did it because we were commanded to.”<br><br>

              Again, satan paused to consider how best to express himself, before this human female. “The people of your time might say we were preprogrammed with a set of instructions. But God wanted a race of beings who would worship him because they made the conscious choice to do so.
              He desired a people whose minds were virtually a blank slate at their birth.
              They would experience His universe most intimately and through that intimate contact come to love Him. Their praise and worship would proceed naturally and willfully from their lips, and thus He created humanity.”<br><br>

              The intensity in the dark lord’s face grew. “I had never questioned God’s motives, no angel questioned God, not until that moment. We loved Him, all of us, even I loved Him. But it seemed as if He had become weary of us, in much the same way as a child grows weary of playing with an old toy. He needed a new distraction. It was then when I confronted Him; never had I done such a thing. I spoke of our concerns. Had we somehow displeased Him? He assured me that this was not the case. He in no way loved us less; He simply desired the creation of a new sort of being, one created in His own image, His own likeness. He had already selected a world upon which He would bring humanity into existence. I pleaded with Him to reconsider, but His mind was made up.”<br><br>

              Satan abruptly turned from Serena and looked to the others in the great room. “Many of you remember that fateful day, I’m sure. I was the visionary, and you shared in that vision. We saw then the threat humankind represented. The ascent of man had to be prevented. The time for change was at hand, and you turned to me as the instrument of that change. God’s plan, His rule, had to be brought to an end. And who better to bring about that end than I? Our rule, my rule, would have been the beginning of a new age, the age of an enlightened angelic empire. We would have brought stability to the universe, it was our birthright.”<br><br>

              Satan pirouetted slowly, his hands raised to the sky. Serena watched in stunned amazement.<br>
              “But our brethren would not listen, their minds had been dulled by God’s promises, they refused to see the truth. So we alone took up arms against the creator. You all fought bravely, all of you, but we were too few.
              In the end, our defeat was inevitable. But even then, God showed weakness.
              Even when we were brought before Him for judgment, He could not bring himself to destroy us utterly. Instead, He cast us out into this place, beyond His precious universe. Perhaps He thought that this would be a far greater punishment than bringing us to utter destruction.<br><br>

              “But He was wrong, we not only survived, we thrived. It was difficult at first, but slowly we established a new order, a new universe. And from that universe, we struck out against the upstart, man and woman. We have brought low God’s great experiment. And one day soon, very soon, when we have grown strong, we shall return to God’s universe, not just as spirits, but in physical form. On that day, we shall depose God and His angels, and a new order shall be brought forth.”<br><br>

              A loud cheer rose from the multitude throughout the room. It grew in intensity and enthusiasm. “All hail, satan!” they shouted, over and over again.<br><br>

              Satan’s speech reminded Serena of old films she had seen of Adolph Hitler’s great rallies, during the 1930s. There was the ranting of a megalomaniac, followed by the rhythmic chanting of people caught up in the passion of the moment. For beings that resented humans so much, they acted a lot like them.<br><br>

              Satan turned abruptly toward Serena. Within his eyes, the mirror of his dark soul, Serena could see madness.<br><br>

              “Then, when you humans began to stray, when God’s great experiment began to fail, as I knew it would, He cast great multitudes of your kind into outer darkness, and we were waiting for them.” The dark lord was becoming agitated, his thundering voice becoming ever louder. “You wonder why we hate you, why we torment you. It is because an arbitrary and irresolute God offered unto you a glory greater than ours, a privilege of which you are wholly unworthy. In the end, you were to become the judges of our deeds, the authors of our fates. Yet, you are the usurpers. Your kind will never be accepted here! We will confine you, desecrate you, and drive you insane with pain! We will hurt God by hurting you. Do you now understand?”<br><br>

              Serena battled to control her terror. “Completely,” she replied. “I’m just sorry that it had to be this way.”<br><br>

              “I’m certain that you are,” said satan, his tone almost mocking. His remark met with a round of cruel mirth from his loyal disciples.<br><br>

              “There is so much you could teach us,” continued Serena, determined to make one last desperate appeal. “I mean, you’ve accomplished so much out here. I’d hoped to witness, to experience, what you’ve created. I’d hoped to learn from you. It is, well, scientific curiosity.” Serena realized how lame that excuse sounded. She had angered the devil, and fully expected to be on the receiving end of an even greater portion of his wrath.<br><br>

              Satan laughed openly. “Science; yes, I understand the methods of human science. Allow me to enlighten you. Scientific curiosity; and the observations that flow from it mean nothing, if you are unable to share your results with others of your kind. I assure you, that you won’t be doing that.
              In fact, you’re about to become a part of the experiment.”<br><br>

              Satan’s comment precipitated another round of laughter from the multitude of demons that surrounded him. Serena, however, wasn’t laughing; but she wasn’t groveling either. She fought to maintain her emotional ground.<br><br>

              Satan’s attention once more turned to his kneeling victim. Both his tone and his expression had changed. They seemed far less menacing than before. His oral history highlights hadn’t achieved their desired effect.<br><br>

              “You truly wish to know more about my realm?”<br>
              Serena nodded.<br>
              For a moment, satan seemed to ponder Serena’s request; then he spoke again. “Nearly all of my guests are taken by my minions directly and without fanfare to the special place of torment chosen for them; the place where they shall spend eternity. They know nothing of the rest of my vast empire, for they are trapped by their own unique situation. They don’t have much time to ponder the nature of my realm; their own agony leaves them little room for such higher thoughts. This is not a place of learning, wench;
              it is a place of torture, pain, and pandemonium.”<br><br>

              The prince of darkness paused. Perhaps he would grant this wench’s request, give her a true appreciation of his power, of his creative genius, before she entered her own place of torment.<br><br>

              “Very well Serena; I will give you twelve hours to wander freely about this world of mine, unhindered, unbound, and in no pain.”<br><br>

              ?uite abruptly, the shackles fell from Serena’s wrists and the collar fell from her neck—she was free. She slowly moved her wrists and saw that they were scarred from the barbed interior of the shackles, but the burns had already healed.<br><br>

              “Your new body heals with great rapidity,” confirmed satan, seeming to reading Serena’s mind. “It has to.”
              ?uite abruptly, a pair of brown leather sandals materialized on the floor in front of her.<br><br>

              “Put them on!” commanded satan. “If you are to wander about my realm, you might as well walk in comfort. You see, most of my guests don’t need such things. They aren’t going anywhere.”<br><br>

              Again, there was a subdued chuckle from the odd crowd that had gathered around her. Perhaps it was considered necessary to respond to the master’s dry and sadistic humor.<br><br>

              Serena fumbled to put the sandals on, as the prince of darkness walked down the three steps to stand before his human captive. He crossed his arms as he took a closer look at his comely guest.<br><br>

              “Rise,” he commanded.<br>
              Serena did as she was told. It was difficult, though, because her muscles were quivering in fear. She tried to control them.<br>
              “Extend your open palm.”<br><br>

              Again Serena complied, stretching out her right hand, upturned and open. Satan placed a very small hourglass into her palm.<br><br>

              “Look at me, little one,” he continued.<br><br>

              Serena looked up, their eyes met. To be this close to the prince of darkness was nothing short of terrifying. She felt overwhelmed by his evil.<br><br>

              “You can not stop the flow of sand through this hourglass,” he said, pointing to the tiny glass. “It will always flow in the same direction. It will require twelve hours to travel its course. During that time, you may travel as you please, and observe what you wish, with but two provisions. One, you may not intervene in any way in the torments of any of my guests. Two, when the last grain of sand has traveled its course, you must be atop the cliff overlooking the great sea of fire. There you shall throw yourself from the precipice, to begin your eternity of burning torment.”<br><br>

              Throw herself in? That was too much to ask.<br>
              “If you are late for your appointment, or attempt to aid one of my guests, I shall send my minions out to hunt you down. Believe me when I tell you, that it is within my power to make your torment here far worse. Do you understand?”<br><br>

              “Yes,” Serena said.<br>
              “Then go,” replied satan, pointing to the portal behind Serena. “Follow your shadow. It will lead you to your eternal destiny.”<br><br>

              Serena turned to discover that the portal displayed an image of a barren desert. Yet it seemed three dimensional, holographic. It was her doorway, her gateway to Hell. She glanced once more toward the hourglass in her hand. Its sand had already begun to flow. Serena took a trembling step toward the portal; then stopped.<br><br>

              “I will give you a gentler journey through the portal this time. I do not wish to confuse or dull your senses. I want you to experience my kingdom with a clear mind, behold it in all of its grandeur.”<br><br>

              Serena still hesitated.<br>
              “Go before I change my mind!” commanded satan in a demanding tone.
              Serena took five quick steps. The fifth carried her through the portal, and into the realm of the damned.<br><br>

                  </p>

      
      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <!-- <p class="chapterTitle">The Vision</p> -->

            <p>
              THE journey from the audience chamber, through the portal, and into the barren landscape beyond was instantaneous, more like walking through a doorway between rooms. It was hot and dry here, perhaps 90 degrees or so, and the air held a faint odor of sulfur. A great red luminary, far larger but dimmer than the Earth’s sun, illuminated her surroundings with a somber, amber light. Serena turned around to see nothing but the desert and the barren, craggy mountains beyond; the portal through which she had traveled was gone.<br><br>

              Serena stood there for a moment taking in the unearthly landscape. She was situated near the edge of a wide, boulder-strewn valley, at least a few miles wide. Its length was indeterminate, extending in both directions as far as the eye could see. The rocks and ground were rusty brown, and the sky was filled with billowing gray clouds of smoke and dust that swept swiftly across the face of the swollen sun, yet here at ground level there was hardly a breath of wind.<br><br>

              So this was Hell. Serena wasn’t really sure what she had expected, but somehow this was not quite it. It sort of reminded her of the Mojave Desert, perhaps Death Valley. Hell was not a series of subterranean passageways winding their way through the deepest recesses of the Earth. No, Hell was an entire world unto itself, a world circling a lone red star in a region beyond the known universe. That much she had deduced from her conversation with the angel. It seemed like science fiction.<br><br>

              Serena looked at the small hourglass in her hand. It was scarcely an inch long, and no matter how she held it, the sand flowed in the same direction.
              It was as incongruous as the rest of this place.<br><br>

              What now, follow her shadow? That wouldn’t be too difficult, her shadow stretched out before her, at least a dozen feet long. It occurred to her that she hadn’t asked how long or difficult a journey this might be. Such questions hadn’t been on her mind at the time. Maybe it would have been better to have simply been cast directly into the sea of fire and get it over with all at once. What was she going to accomplish out here during the next twelve hours?<br><br>

              “Delay the beginning of eternal agony,” she said out loud, answering her own question.<br><br>

              Almost unconsciously she began to follow her own shadow. The way she figured it, her route would take her directly down the valley, through a lonely realm of hard packed clay and rocks. At least it was preferable to scaling the steep mountains on either side. That would have been a considerable task for anyone, short of an expert climber with all of the right equipment.<br><br>

              She paused for a moment, again gazing at her bleak surroundings. As far as she could see, she was the only traveler upon this barren landscape.
              That in itself surprised her. Where were all of the tormented souls? Did she really want to know?<br><br>

              Perhaps she was going about this all wrong. Perhaps she should have taken off in the other direction, up the valley, perhaps into the hills. But could she really hide from satan in his own realm? Perhaps satan would lose track of her, perhaps forget her. After all, there had to be billions of souls in this place. Did he keep tabs on every one of them? No, now she was trying to delude herself. There wasn’t so much as a chance of that happening. She continued on with her scientific expedition.<br><br>

              A scientific expedition? There was a time when such concepts had held a very strong appeal. She had had such a passion for science in high school.
              She had hoped to major in science or engineering in college. But there were financial considerations. Her parents hadn’t seen science or engineering as proper professions for a young woman. With no support from home, she and her first husband had attempted to put themselves through college, working as a team. It had sounded like a good plan, yet she’d been forced to drop out of community college after only two semesters to get a full time job. That had been the end of her academic career and her dreams of becoming a scientist. That was, until now.<br><br>

              The journey before her was, in a way, a sort of scientific expedition, a journey of discovery. She looked at her clothes. She was not very well outfitted for an expedition. Nonetheless, she would see and experience things that no living human had ever seen or experienced before. It was an incredible opportunity, if only she had a camera, a tape recorder, even a notebook.<br><br>

              No, Serena realized that she wasn’t thinking straight. She wondered if she was in the midst of some emotional condition akin to shock. This wasn’t some sort of research project. At the end of this excursion into the unknown was an unimaginable fate. Yet she couldn’t allow herself to think of such things. Better to exist in a state of denial for now, create in her mind some sort of fantasy. Perhaps she would find Chris at the end of the road.
              Perhaps God would grant her a last minute pardon, a reprieve. Perhaps He was just testing her, seeing if she would surrender to the devil’s will, or find a new faith in her Creator. It was a hope that she would cling to, cling to until the flames of the sea of fire burned it to blackened ashes.<br><br>

              Serena saw not a single sign of life as she carefully navigated her way around the rocks and boulders strewn randomly about the barren valley. Not even a trace of lichens adhered to the brown angular rocks. In the absence of life, it was amazingly quiet, only the sound of wind in the hills disturbed the silence.<br><br>

              ?uite suddenly there was a sound. Amidst a realm of silence it seemed greatly magnified. It was a distant screech, like that of a bird of prey. Serena turned in surprise to see it flying swiftly through the air not too far to her left. It was a large dark bird, perhaps an eagle or a vulture. Its wings beat swiftly against the hot air. It was apparently in a hurry to get somewhere.
              Serena followed its course with her eyes, and in the distance saw still more of them, many more, pirouetting upon the thermals, diving and soaring, as if they had discovered a source of food amidst this barren land. The place of their gathering lay directly in her path. She figured that she would soon discover the object or objects of their interest. She quickened her pace.<br><br>

              It was about ten minutes before she heard the distant sounds of distress from someplace up ahead, the dreadful sounds of the screaming and wailing of a great multitude. As yet she couldn’t see the source of the distress, for it lay hidden beyond a ridge of rubble that ran the entire width of the valley, but it had attracted a vast armada of the large birds. In places the sky was visibly darkened by their presence. Never had she seen such a multitude of birds in one place, especially ones of this size.<br><br>

              Serena scrambled up the low ridge of rocks and gravel. The wailing beyond grew ever louder. Reaching the top of the rise, she beheld the source of the terrible commotion. The land before her had been cleared of boulders and leveled. Stretching across the entire width of the valley and as far down the valley as she could see, were millions of rectangular black altars arranged in orderly rows. All appeared to be identical, perhaps two and a half feet high, two feet wide, and three feet long.<br><br>

              Upon most of the altars were human forms, men and women, dressed in the same filthy attire. Stretched across the altars in unnatural positions, their heads and legs hung over the ends of black stone slabs. Their feet dangled a few inches above the ground, held by a pair of ankle shackles mounted by short chains to the base of the altar. A tight, heavy chain looped around their throats forced their heads back. Their wrists were also secured in shackles mounted to the left and right sides of the slab, rendering them totally helpless. They screamed, cried, and cursed in a chorus of agony that echoed across the barren landscape. They wiggled and squirmed wildly, yet in total futility, as the armada of large vultures feed ravenously upon their prone human prey.<br><br>

              It was a ghastly sight as the large black birds, perched upon the hapless victims, digging into their flesh with their long beaks, and pulling forth chunks of meat and lengths of entrails. Blood pulsed from severed arteries, and oozed from deep wounds drenching the altars in crimson essence. Some of the blood dripped down the sides, while even more was lapped up by the merciless black vultures. No less than two or three of the winged tormentors at a time would feed upon a victim. As one bird would leave with a bloody piece of stringy meat in his beak, another would quickly replace it, and the feast would continue.<br><br>

              “Oh God!” gasped Serena turning away in disgust. What sort of sick mind would come up with such nightmarish torment? Yet she knew the answer to that one, a being full of hate and jealousy.<br><br>

              If there were only another way around, a means by which she might avoid this field of agony. There wasn’t. After a minute, Serena made her way down the small ridge of crumbling rock and into the midst of a nightmare.<br><br>

              At first she was afraid that the birds might turn upon her; but they were too preoccupied with the easy pickings upon the altars to concern themselves with a victim who might resist. She went virtually unnoticed.<br><br>

              Physically, it wasn’t difficult to make her way through this place. The ground was hard and level, and there was at least a half dozen feet of open space between each of the altars. She tried not to look at the horror around her, tried not to hear the moans and screams of the tormented. But how could she not? Perhaps she would go unnoticed by the victims, but those around her cried out to her, pleading in a hundred different languages for mercy. She could hardly ignore their pleas, yet she knew she could do nothing. Tears streamed from her eyes as she made her way through the field of carnage.<br><br>

              The tormented victims around her existed in many different stages of dismemberment. Some were almost fully intact, while the flesh of others had been almost completely ripped from their bones, leaving little more than indigestible sinew and unpalatable organs. Yet, even the most horribly desecrated continued to moan and cry in pain, for there was no death beyond death, only eternal existence.<br><br>

              From above, a new commotion arose, a terrible scream. Serena looked up to see two demonic beings with leathery wings, robed wholly in black.
              Their skin was dark gray, their faces ancient, wrinkled, and contorted. Their hands were not at all like human hands. No, they were as much claws as hands, with sharp glistening nails at the end of each slender finger. Between them, they held a rag-clad woman.<br><br>

              Within seconds they had landed, scarcely 50 feet away. Serena came to a halt, surprised that they took no notice of her. Instead, one roughly pushed the poor woman toward a vacant altar. The middle aged woman turned toward the dark being, a look of horror upon her face.<br><br>

              “Your altar awaits you, wench,” said the demon in a deep gruff voice.
              He motioned to the shiny black monolith. “Lay down upon it now, the vultures are famished.”<br><br>

              The woman looked about frantically, as if searching for any means of escape, yet there was no place to run, no place to hide. “Please, no,” she pleaded, tears in her eyes. “It’s inhuman!”<br><br>

              “But as you may have noticed, we are not human,” said the other demon. “Let me make it simple for you; you can lay yourself down upon this altar, or we can do it for you, perhaps breaking some of your fragile bones in the process. Choose!”<br><br>

              Weeping bitterly, the woman sat down upon the edge of altar, then after a few seconds she leaned back. Her shoulders met the warm stone, never to leave it again, while her head and legs hung over the stone slab.<br><br>

              The demons went quickly to work, placing her arms and legs in black manacles. The spiny manacles closed decisively, welding themselves together with a horrible searing heat that Serena knew all too well. Amidst the smoke of burning flesh, the woman cries were temporarily muted, as one of the demons brought the chain around her throat and locked it in place. Her head swung backward; as she struggled to reduce the brutal pressure its links applied to her soft pulsing throat.<br><br>

              The demons wasted no time in departing, leaving this wretched woman to the ravenous vultures. She pulled at her manacles, but the chains that coupled each of her restraints to this abominable altar gave her little mobility. Already several vultures had noticed her plight, and circled downward toward her.<br><br>

              “Oh God!” she cried, yanking again at the formidable chains that restrained her.<br><br>

              A large vulture, with a wingspan of at least 3 feet, swept within inches of the poor woman as she wept bitterly. Up to this point Serena had stood there motionless, fearful to intervene, but not anymore. She rushed to the woman’s side waving her arms wildly in the air.<br><br>

              “Go away you horrible thing, go away!”<br>
              The startled vulture veered sharply away, climbing back into the turbulent sky. The dark haired woman looked at Serena incredulously, at first not understanding what was going on.<br><br>

              “Who, who are you?” she gasped, gazing up at her unexpected benefactor. “How’d you get here?”<br><br>

              “I’m just like you,” began Serena, “a damned soul abandoned by God, doomed to this place.” Serena did her best to quickly explain her situation.
              Considering this woman’s shattered state of mind, she wasn’t so sure just how much of it registered with her.<br><br>

              “Then you weren’t sent here to rescue me?” asked the woman. “I’d hoped that God might have reconsidered my case and pardoned me.”<br><br>

              “I’m afraid not,” replied Serena, “But I’ll try to protect you, as long as I can.”<br><br>

              Serena didn’t want to give this poor woman false hope, but what else could she say? Right now, her presence had somehow produced an island of temporary calm in this sea of agony and terror. The birds seemed to avoid her, but she couldn’t stay here long, and when she left, this poor woman’s torment would begin. Serena would remain as long as she could, despite the devil’s warning.<br><br>

              She closely examined the woman’s shackles, hoping that there might be a weakness that she could exploit in an attempt to free her, but there wasn’t.
              The burns left around the woman’s wrists were dreadful, the worst she had ever seen. Her skin had actually been charred beneath the seams where the shackles had welded themselves together. What a cruel and barbaric method of restraint. Then again, what purpose would a lock and key have served on shackles that would remain closed for all eternity? From satan’s viewpoint, it was infinitely practical.<br><br>

              Serena looked at the countless others. She didn’t care what they had done in life, no crime warranted this sort of cruelty. If only there was something she could do; yet she realized that she was just as damned as any of these, only the means by which she would be punished was different.<br><br>

              The woman seemed somewhat calmer now. “My name is Karen, Karen Collins.”<br><br>

              “Serena Davis,” replied Serena.<br>
              “I’m sorry that we had to meet like this,” continued Karen.<br>
              “Me too,” Serena said. She hesitated; she wasn’t sure how well her next question might be received. “Do you have any idea why you’re here? I mean, why this?”<br><br>

              Karen closed her eyes for a moment. “My heart attack was my ticket here,” she said bitterly. “It isn’t fair, I mean, I’m only 42…42. I quit smoking eight years ago, hadn’t had a sick day in years, for God’s sake, I went to aerobics three times a week. A heart attack shouldn’t have happened, no, not to me, but there it was.”<br><br>

              “I don’t think any of us were safe from death,” Serena said. “I was only 28.”<br><br>

              Karen didn’t seem to notice Serena’s comment. Her head swung from side to side, as she stared in disbelief at her seared wrists, which incredibly, had already begun to heal. “Oh God, this crazy itching in my wrists, its driving me nuts,” said Karen, trying to twist her wrists in the manacles, to somehow alleviate the awful discomfort. Her efforts were rewarded by a trickle of blood as the barbs within the shackles dug into her still tender flesh. Her wrists went still.<br><br>

              “I was getting ready to go to work,” Karen said. “You see; I’m a full partner in a large law firm in Atlanta. It had taken me years of hard work to get to where I was, but it was finally paying off. I had so much to live for.
              There was no warning; the pain started suddenly, the worst chest pain I’d ever felt. It was like there was a ton of weight on top of me. There was no one at home to help me. My husband had already left for work, and my son was on his way to school; I was alone. I stumbled to the phone, managed to call 911, but I could hardly speak. If they came, they came too late. The next thing I knew, I was being sucked into this violet tunnel. It was horrible.”<br><br>

              Serena only nodded. She was getting to know the procedure pretty well.<br><br>

              “I was taken to the grandest courtroom I had ever seen, where I was forced to kneel before God,” said Karen, who seemed to be more agitated again. “There was a huge audience in the gallery, as I watched my whole life flash before my eyes, in some sort of vision. I didn’t like what I saw. It was biased, it wasn’t fair. I mean, I did a lot of good in my life. I raised a loving son, saved more clients from being run over by the system than I can remember. I saved lives! But in this courtroom, I wasn’t even afforded the opportunity to seek council, or even argue my own case. When it was all over, I was told that my name wasn’t found in the Lamb’s Book of Life, and that was the end of it. God condemned me just like that, sentenced me to outer darkness. What kind of justice is that? It wasn’t fair.”<br><br>

              Tears streamed from Karen’s eyes, as she gazed upward at the circling birds, awaiting the coming feast. “Why can’t they at least give me a fighting chance? Why do I have to be shackled and helpless? I can’t stand it.”<br><br>

              “I was dragged away by an angel, carried into Hell,” continued Karen.
              “Everything happened so fast. Next thing I knew, the angel had thrown me into some sort of hellish holding cell. Believe me, I’ve seen a lot of horrendous holding tanks, but this was the worst.” Karen again paused.
              “But I guess you know about all of that.”<br><br>

              Serena nodded. “That was the way it was for me too.”<br>
              “They forced me out of my clothes, and into these horrible smelling rags, dragged me off to be sentenced by satan himself. Satan accused me of being uncharitable, of serving self and money. He said that since I had failed to do service to God, since I had not sacrificed anything of myself, that I myself would be sacrificed to the birds of the air on this altar for all eternity. It’s insane! How can he do this to me?”<br><br>

              Karen was becoming far more agitated. Her voice increased in volume, yet trembled at the same time. She again yanked upon the chains that restrained her. “I’ll never see my husband or son again; I’m going to be on this damn altar forever! They’re going to eat me forever! I want out of here!
              Let me loose, let me loose! Help!” she screamed.<br><br>

              Serena tried to calm her, but it was no use. Karen flailed about wildly, screaming and cursing at the top of her lungs, cursing both God and satan.
              Serena stepped back.<br><br>

              Within seconds one of the birds was upon Karen, scratching at her left leg with its sharp talons, pecking viciously at her bare belly with its large pointed beak. Blood began to spill. Karen howled and flailed about wildly, but it was to no avail, the execution of her sentence had begun.<br><br>

              Serena ran, tears streaming from her eyes. She ran like a frightened animal, driven on by pure adrenaline. She felt like she could run forever.
              She tried to block out the screams around her, tried to focus on the ground in front of her, but in vain. There was no escape from the terror, not in Hell.<br><br>

              Serena wasn’t sure how far or how long she had run when exhaustion finally took its toll. Apparently, there was a limit to human endurance, even here. She collapsed to the ground amidst the blood-stained altars, amidst the cries of torment that echoed from every corner of her world, and there she wept.<br><br>

              “Please don’t cry,” came a voice from nearby, nearly masked by the din of agony all around. The voice was strained, the voice of one in great pain.<br><br>

              Serena looked in the direction of the voice, to discover a man shackled to the altar. In reality, he was little more than a collection of bones, torn muscles, and shattered organs. The birds had apparently abandoned him in search of better pickings; yet, like any victim of Hell’s fury, his body was regenerating. New muscle was growing, spreading over blood-stained bones, while within his chest, his vital organs and blood vessels were repairing themselves at a phenomenal pace. It was a thoroughly unnatural and grotesque process, one that sent a chill up Serena’s spine.<br><br>

              Again the tormented being spoke. Only the timbre of his voice told Serena that this lump of flesh and bone was, in reality, a man. “Where are you going, child?”<br><br>

              “The sea of fire,” replied Serena.<br>
              “I’m sorry,” he replied, his voice full of genuine sympathy. “I guess there aren’t any pleasant destinations in this place.” His head turned slowly toward Serena. She gazed into a face that was as much bone as ravaged flesh. The eyes were set deep in the dark sockets of his skull, and Serena wondered if they might not have been there at all just a few minutes ago.
              His nose was little more than a bloody stump, but it too seemed to be regenerating. “Please excuse my appearance. I know it must be frightening to you.”<br><br>

              “No, no it’s not,” replied Serena. She lied.<br>
              “The birds will be leaving me in peace for a time,” continued the man.
              “That is, until I am whole once more. Then the entire ordeal will begin anew. As best I can figure; it takes about four hours for the birds to pick one of us clean. Then it takes about an hour or so for our bodies to reconstitute.
              It is an endless cycle, as endless as eternity itself.”<br><br>

              “Who are you?” asked Serena, trying to dry the tears from her eyes.
              “My name is Thomas Allen Stanford,” was the reply. “Not that names mean a great deal here.”<br><br>

              “I’m Serena Davis,” replied Serena.<br>
              “I’m sorry that you’re here,” continued Thomas, “though, I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you.”<br>
              Serena smiled slightly; this man’s kind voice had calmed her. She really needed someone to talk to. “May I ask how long you’ve been here?”<br><br>

              “You can ask,” came the reply, “I don’t think I could tell you. You see, after a while, time is a thing that can get pretty blurred here. “I passed into this world in 1938, just before Christmas. How long has that been?”<br><br>

              “A long time,” said Serena, doing the math. “It’s 2007 now.”<br>
              “Sixty-nine years,” interjected Thomas, almost immediately.<br>
              “Your math skills are sharper than mine,” noted Serena.<br>
              There was a slight sound that came from Thomas. Serena thought it might have been a chuckle. “I had to be good with numbers; you see I was a banker, a bank president to be more specific. I was in the banking business for over 30 years, through good times and bad. I was a good businessman, and I did my job well. My small bank was one of the few that survived the stock market crash of ‘29, and it continued to thrive on through the depression that followed. Yes, LaSalle National continued to serve the greater Chicago area with courtesy and efficiency through those dark days.
              But it was such a long time ago. I sometimes wonder if that dependable old bank is still there today.”<br><br>

              “I really don’t know,” admitted Serena.<br>
              “Well, I guess it doesn’t matter, does it? At least not to us, not here. I doubt that we will be taking out a home improvement loan anytime soon.”
              Thomas pulled weakly upon the chains that bound him. “Nope, this altar and these shackles are as sound today as they were on the day they were fashioned. All of our needs are seen to here. We want for nothing, except possibly an end to our torment.” Thomas paused. “I’m sorry. I know that outburst was uncalled for. I didn’t want to upset you. I guess my etiquette has become a little coarse over the years.”<br><br>

              “It’s OK, really,” Serena said, hesitating to ask the next question. “But why are you here?” She regretted asking the instant she said it.<br><br>

              “It’s all right,” assured Thomas, “I don’t mind talking about it. I’m paying the price for my affluence, pride, and arrogance. You see, the board of directors of my bank had blessed me with a very generous salary. After all, my brilliant financial strategies had pulled our institution through a crisis that had crushed many of our competitors. We even acquired several of those competitors during those dark years of the depression.<br><br>

              “I showered my family with the blessings of our wealth. My wife and two daughters wanted for nothing. We lived in a large, beautiful home in one of the most affluent areas of the city; threw lavish parties; became part of Chicago’s elite society. My daughters attended a prestigious private college, and their weddings were large and important social events. Life was beautiful—at least for us.<br><br>

              But somewhere along the line I had forgotten one thing, charity. In the midst of our affluence, we had forgotten the millions of suffering people around us. Socially, we had nothing to do with those less fortunate than ourselves; after all, what would our friends say? In my business affairs, I made loans only to those people whom I counted as good risks, and that meant persons that I considered at least socially acceptable. I wasn’t afraid to foreclose on an overdue mortgage, just because the client was out of work. After all, my bank wasn’t a charity. We were a business, and we were in it to make money.”<br><br>

              Thomas paused. A grunt of pain emanated from his lips. Flesh now covered virtually all of his face, and his nose was nearly whole. His rib bones were rapidly being covered with new muscle tissue and his internal organs were nearly restored. Yet, the pain associated with the entire process was apparent upon his countenance, and in the abrupt jolts that occasionally racked his body as nerves reconnected, once more transmitting pain from ravaged regions of his desecrated body.<br><br>

              “I thought of the poor as being inferior. There was only so much money to go around, and ‘a fool and his money were soon parted.’ Most of the money came to rest in the hands of those who used it most wisely and effectively, hands like mine. In such hands, money attracted more money.
              But, you see, I had never been poor, never considered the circumstances under which those in poverty lived. All that many of those people needed to get back on their feet was a helping hand, perhaps my hand, but I never extended it to them. I was in a position to make a difference, but I didn’t.<br><br>

              Serena, we are our brother’s and sister’s keeper. In all of my 68 years of life on Earth, I never came to realize that simple fact. I realize it now, but now it’s too late. Once, my world was my wife and children, the house on Ventnor Drive, and my office on the 16th floor. But now this is my world, an altar of pain amidst the eternal heat and harsh sun of this barren valley.
              The sun never sets on this place, you know. It beats down on you constantly, unremittingly. What I wouldn’t give for a night, even a shadow.<br><br>

              Oh, to feel the rain upon my face, even a drop of water upon my lips, but all of that is gone, part of another life.”<br><br>
              Thomas turned to gaze upon the pain and misery that surrounded them.
              “I often wonder if my wife, Susan, is somewhere here among us. I guess I’ll never know.” Thomas turned once more to Serena. “Oh, she was such a beautiful woman, a loving wife and mother. I hope and pray that she isn’t here. I pray that today she dwells with God in Heaven. In that case, she wouldn’t remember me at all, would she? Perhaps that would be for the best. Perhaps our two daughters are there with her by now. I hope so. I want so much for them to be happy. They don’t deserve to be in this place.”<br><br>

              Serena stumbled to her feet. She walked to the altar, knelt by his side, and took the hand of Thomas in hers, in an attempt to lend to him some measure of comfort. Thomas was now almost fully regenerated. Only a few scars remained to attest to the suffering he had most recently endured. He had the appearance of a man in his late 30s, and a handsome one at that. Yet decades of pain had etched its mark around his sad eyes.<br><br>

              “You can’t realize just how good it has been to talk to you, Serena,” continued Thomas. “None of those around me speak English. I suspect that fact is courtesy of satan himself.”<br><br>

              Thomas strained to gaze toward the sky, toward the great hoard of buzzards circling overhead. Experience told him that his time was indeed short. “I’m afraid that I‘ve been doing all of the talking. Time in Hell is eternal, but moments like this, moments without pain and in good company, are precious. I know that you will need to leave me soon, and we will never meet again, but I would like to know a little about you, about your life. That is, if you don’t mind.”<br><br>

              Serena didn’t mind; she so desperately needed to talk to someone. She told Thomas about her all too brief existence among the living, about the rock house in Oregon, about Chris. It was when she spoke of her love lost, that tears came once more to her eyes. What was she going to do?<br><br>

              “I’m sorry that you’ve lost someone so wonderful,” said Thomas, “but I’m sure that there are many heartbreaking stories to be heard here. It might have been better for us all if we had no memory of our lives on Earth.<br><br>

              “Thomas, do you think there’s any hope for us?” asked Serena.<br>

              “I fear not,” was the response. “In the great judgment hall, God himself sentenced me to outer darkness until the day of final judgment. What will happen after that, I can’t say, but I fear our fates are sealed. I only wish that I could give you another answer, a more optimistic one. I fear that Jesus was our only hope of escaping this place, and we both rejected Him.”
              Serena shook her head sadly. “If we only had another chance.”<br><br>

              Thomas squeezed Serena’s hand. “If I knew then what I know now, I truly believe that I would have changed my ways. But you see, at the time, I believed that the only thing beyond death was eternal sleep. One had to live life to its fullest, for all too soon it would be gone. Now understand, I took my family to church from time to time, but I guess that I just wasn’t listening to the sermons very carefully.”<br><br>

              Again Thomas looked skyward. The terrible black birds were gathering above him. His body was whole once more. It was time for the cycle to be repeated, as it had countless times before. “Serena, it’s time for you to go now.”<br><br>

              “If I stay I might be able to protect you for a while,” replied Serena, who couldn’t bear to think of her newfound friend in agony again. “Maybe you could get some rest, a break from all the pain. I’d be happy to watch over you, shield you from the sun; protect you from the birds. It would be no trouble at all, really.”<br><br>

              “You are such a dear sweet person,” replied Thomas. “It makes your presence here all the more tragic. But if you stay, things might be all the worse for you. Remember what satan told you about helping others here?
              Now go, please, and don’t look back.”<br><br>

              Serena rose to her feet; then leaned down to kiss Thomas on the cheek.
              “God bless you, Thomas.”<br>

              Thomas wasn’t so sure that such a thing was possible, yet he smiled back at this young woman who had brought a brief moment of respite from his eternity of pain. “And you too, Serena.”<br><br>

              Serena turned to leave, then hesitated.<br>
              “Go quickly, Serena,” warned Thomas, the volume of his warning increasing. “Run, get away from this place.”<br><br>

              Serena walked and then ran. She never looked back. She couldn’t bear to look at what was destined to happen.<br><br>

              “Good-bye Serena,” whispered Thomas, as he strained to watch her diminishing form vanish into the distance. A terrible shadow swept across his body as one of the huge birds passed by inches above. It climbed and pirouetted in midair before swooping back in his direction. Shackles rattled as he closed his eyes and prepared to experience the next chapter in the eternal tragedy of the late Thomas Allen Stanford.<br><br>

              THE dominion of black altars and swarming vultures went on for miles.
              Serena could hardly imagine how many tormented souls were trapped here, nor did she care to attempt the computation. It was like a great city, the altars set up with mathematical precision like homes along well-planned streets and avenues. There was only one industry in this great metropolis, one product—the eternally regenerating raw flesh of its unwilling citizens.
              And there was no lack of consumers for that product. The ravenous birds of prey consumed everything that the city’s inhabitants could produce, and still hungered for more. It was an economy, indeed, an ecosystem like none other. <br><br>

              How Serena longed for an end to it all. She could bear the screams of agony no longer, the terrible sounds of pecking and pulling, and the dreadful caws and cries of the birds in the midst of their feeding frenzy.
              Was there ever an end to it all, or would it extend all the way to the sea of fire?<br><br>

              At long last, Serena beheld it, the final row of altars and a great levy of rock and soil beyond it, not unlike the one she had scaled on her way into this terrible place. At the very heart of the city, virtually every black altar had been occupied by a desecrated soul. But here in the suburbs, most of the altars were vacant, shiny slabs of obsidian awaiting the arrival of eternal victims.<br><br>

              Then the strange irony struck her. Like most earthly cities, this one was growing like a beast, claiming more and more of the countryside around it.
              Land was cleared and new altars were fabricated to make room for the steady stream of unwitting inhabitants who were sure to come.<br><br>

              “Oh, if only there was some way to warn them,” whimpered Serena. “If only they knew what was ahead.”<br><br>

              What was it like to be eaten by birds again and again while you lay there, shackled and helpless for all eternity? It was an unimaginable concept. How did one keep their sanity amidst all this destruction? Thomas Stanford had. His kind words had pulled her back from the brink of hysteria. He had been a friend when she desperately needed one. If only she could have repaid the favor in kind. She felt so helpless. Just thinking of that brave soul now brought even more tears to her eyes, then open sobbing.
              Did one, in time, get used to the eternal cycle of pain? She hadn’t thought to ask. She wouldn’t have.<br><br>

              She paused, sitting down upon one of the vacant altars for a moment, trying to compose herself. Right now she was so tired, more mentally than physically. She heard a round of screeches and cries from the birds circling above. She turned her gaze upward, then to the instrument upon which she sat, to its glistening surface shimmering in the red sunlight, to the chains and barbed shackles securely anchored on it. She considered its purpose.
              She thought better of her decision and quickly jumped to her feet. To sit here was sacrilegious, perhaps even obscene. She would only rest her feet when she was well clear of this place. She moved on, eventually passing the last row of monoliths and scrambling over the ridge and into the rocky terrain beyond.<br><br>

              She thought back upon the stories she had heard in high school, stories of the world’s greatest human atrocities. She considered the concentration camps of Nazi Germany and the killing fields of Cambodia, the most terrible acts of human barbarism of the last century. But this experience went beyond acts of genocide—this was eternal torture in the guise of execution for billions. As totally evil as those who masterminded these terrible holocausts were, satan, the architect of this city of pain, was far more nefarious. The beautiful angel who had led the praise to the Most High had become creation’s greatest villain, humankind’s most vile adversary.<br><br>

              Serena couldn’t explain why she turned one last time to look at this realm of horror, yet as she did, a new aspect became apparent. For the past hour she had focused her eyes on the ground in front of her, hardly daring to scan the width and breadth of the dreadful valley, but now she dared. She focused her attention on the hills about a quarter mile to her left. There, just beyond the level expanse of the field of agony, she saw thousands upon thousands of wooden crosses set into the steadily rising terrain, each one held a victim of satan’s hatred. Here too, the black vultures swarmed and fed, adding a new dimension to the horror of this ancient form of execution.<br><br>

              Through the sacrifice of Christ, the Cross had become the instrument by which humankind had been offered redemption. But in satan’s hands, it had become just another form of torture, a route to eternal agony, inspired by the twisted mind of man.<br><br>

              “Oh God!” gasped Serena, quickly turning away. She had no idea as to what horrible sins these poor souls might have committed, but she wasn’t about to go up there and investigate. Instead, she moved on, venturing into the rugged boulder-strewn valley beyond the monoliths.<br><br>

              The cries of agony slowly faded away, yet deep within her mind the screams continued. What she had beheld had profoundly affected her. No doubt, her own coming experience would affect her even more. She cried, not only for herself, but for all of the people who had turned their back on Christ’s love. God hadn’t sent her here, she had. She thought of all of the sins in her life, of all of the people she had hurt, intentionally or inadvertently. There were so many things in her brief existence on Earth that she now so desired to make right, but she no longer had that power.<br><br>

              Her mind wandered back to that green rich Earth. By now, she imagined, her earthly body rested in a coffin 6 feet beneath the Oregon sod, filled with formaldehyde. She wondered how many people had attended her funeral. She and Chris would have been buried side by side in Holly Hillcrest Cemetery, in his family plot; at least she hoped so. There, at least, she and Chris would reside together for eternity.<br><br>

              She tried to imagine that place in spring. She and Chris had gone there to place flowers upon his mother’s grave last May. It was so green and peaceful, a hilltop overlooking the small Oregon town and the farms beyond. Was Chris with his mother now? Serena thought so. She had never met her husband’s mother, she had died when he was only 15, but she had been the wellspring of her husband’s faith. She had educated him in the ways of the Lord, in the ways of caring, and she had done her job well.
              Their reunion was most assuredly a blessed occasion. It would help him deal with her loss. Then Serena remembered; he would never remember that loss. There would be no pain, only joy. Serena wept all the more. Hell was more than pain; it was the separation from God and all of those she had loved on Earth. It was the realization that she was totally forgotten by all who had ever loved her.<br><br>

              Serena stopped. Reaching for the mystical hourglass that she had slipped into the tight upper hem of her loincloth, she stared at the enigmatic device. Yes, there was still plenty of time, only a small fraction of the sand had run its course. But what horrors lay ahead of her, how far did she have to travel? Maybe this wasn’t such a great idea. Maybe she hadn’t been so clever after all. Being thrown quite suddenly and unceremoniously into that fiery pit might have been more merciful than this.<br><br>

              Serena was startled as a long dark shadow swept across her. She turned to behold a tall figure, engulfed in darkness. Satan’s countenance bore a slight but devious smile.<br><br>

              “So, Serena, what do you think of my realm so far? Or may I assume that your tears have already answered my question?”
              “Sir?” she answered awkwardly, trying to gain control of her emotions.
              She wiped the tears from her eyes. “I’m sorry, I didn’t see you coming.”<br><br>

              Satan laughed openly. “Most people never do, until it’s too late. You didn’t.”<br><br>

              Serena looked at the prince of darkness with puzzlement. “I’m sorry, sir, I don’t understand.”<br><br>

              “Of course not,” replied satan, “For years you played your futile spiritual games, Tarot cards, palm reading, rituals to honor a goddess of ancient Celtic mythology; so many games.”<br><br>

              “But the Tarot readings were so often right, as were the palm readings,” objected Serena. “I really thought that I had psychic abilities. Maybe I did.”<br><br>

              Again satan laughed. “Of course the readings seemed to work, my minions and I went to considerable effort to create that illusion to deceive you. It was a diversion. In doing so, we led you and many others away from the truth; and down the road to my kingdom. As to you having psychic abilities; no, little one, I don’t think so.”<br><br>

              That revelation caught Serena off guard. “But why have you taken so much time and effort to get me here, why not someone else?”<br><br>

              Satan sat on a nearby boulder. “Don’t flatter yourself, child. I am a deceiver of nations, of multitudes, yours is just one of my many success stories.”<br><br>

              “But, sir, why did you grant to me the privilege of walking free in Hell for these 12 hours? You said that you would do it to satisfy my scientific curiosity. You also said that it was something that you rarely do. Excuse my boldness, but I suspect that there is something more to it than that.”<br><br>

              Serena knew she was pushing her luck with that comment. After all, this wasn’t just a casual conversation with some stranger on a busy street corner; this was satan, the devil, the villain of eternity that she was addressing.<br><br>

              There was a momentary pause; then satan’s expression broke into a wide grin. “I like you, Serena, at least as much as I could like one of you loathsome humans. I believe that I am coming to understand why God, the Creator, liked you so much.”<br><br>

              That one threw Serena for a loop. “He did?”<br><br>

              “Most certainly,” replied satan. “He spoke of it openly to me, on several occasions. That is one of the reasons that I became so interested in you. Oh yes, I believe that the Ancient of Days had great expectations as far as you were concerned, and even grander plans. Taking you from Him was a particularly sweet victory. You are clever and persuasive, gifted of speech.
              You might have lead many people away from the path to my kingdom during your days on Earth, given the opportunity. Thankfully, you won’t have that opportunity in the sea of fire. It will keep you quite preoccupied, as you will see.”<br><br>

              Serena was absolutely stunned. Yes, she had heard this before, from the angel Aaron, yet, somehow, it hadn’t quite sunk in. “You are still on speaking terms with God, after all that has happened?”<br><br>

              “Don’t be so surprised; of course I am, little one,” laughed satan.
              “Surely, you must have figured that out by now, a woman as bright as yourself. You have heard of the trials of Job, have you not? Did you think that was just a myth? And did you think that the story of Job was an isolated incident? No, there have been many Jobs during the course of history, so many. Surely, you must realize that. The Creator has always valued my opinion. He does even now. I widen His horizons, open His eyes to His own failings. In a manner of speaking, I am His conscience. No one knows Him as I do, nor manipulates Him so effectively. I am the tempter of humanity, the accuser of the brethren, and I shall bring to naught the plans of God.”<br><br>

              “But you spoke about me, you and God?”<br><br>

              “Among other things, yes, your name has come up. Is there some reason that I need to tell these things to you twice?” ?uite abruptly the direction of the conversation changed. “But Serena, what has happened to your scientific curiosity? You have been granted a rare opportunity and you are squandering it. You hardly conducted a meticulous scientific study of the altars of agony, did you? It was both a brilliant and clever feat of engineering, if I do say so myself, an expression of my infinite creativity.”<br><br>

              Satan turned back to the great city of altars, though it was not directly visible from their current location. “I made full utilization of the space available. I’d first thought of making the altars larger, draping the victims across them, shackling their wrists and ankles at the four corners; but that would have been such a waste of space. By making them smaller, I can fit so many more of them in the limited space this valley affords me, and my guests are so much more uncomfortable with their head and legs hanging over the edges. Oh yes, sometimes I even surprise myself with my creativity.”<br><br>

              Serena was speechless. Never had she known something so cruel and conceited.<br><br>

              “As for the hills of crucifixion, well, you turned your back upon them completely. I thought you wanted to learn, glimpse a morsel of my genius, before joining the others in their eternal agony. Once you become part of the experiment, a true subject of my realm, I doubt that you will be in much of a mood to study it objectively.”<br><br>

              Serena searched desperately for an excuse; trying not to show weakness before the prince of darkness. “There wasn’t enough time. I didn’t want to be late in arriving at the sea of fire.” Somehow, she realized that satan saw through her lie. Why was she still trying to promote this deception? It was pointless. Before her stood the master of deception himself, the prince of lies, surely she did not expect to beat him at his own game.<br><br>

              “Ah, I see,” satan said, gently twisting the bottom of his goatee between the fingers of his left hand. “Aren’t you even the least bit curious as to what crime I was addressing in crucifying them?” He didn’t wait for a reply. He rose to his feet, and extended his hand to the young human. “Come with me, little one.”<br><br>

              Serena hesitated then took two steps toward satan. She placed her hand in his. She was surprised to discover that it was soft and warm like a human hand, but there was something else. She could feel the powerful sphere of darkness about this mighty being, a loathsome oppressive spirit. It sent a chill down her spine.<br><br>

              “See, I don’t bite, at least not this time,” chuckled the devil. “Come, I have things to show you.”<br><br>

              Before them, a large circular portal outlined in a shimmering violet aura appeared. Within the ring of luminescent glow, Serena beheld another landscape, another place. Together they walked through, with no more effort than one would expend in walking through a wide open doorway between two rooms in a house. They emerged amidst the rolling hills high above the valley of altars. Serena gazed across the valley, across the vast expanse of pain and despair.<br><br>

              “Magnificent, is it not?” proclaimed satan, stretching his arm out toward the valley below. “There are over 2 ½ million altars at this site alone, 72 percent of which are currently occupied. And there are 93 other sites similar to this one throughout Hell, some larger, and others somewhat smaller. The largest has a capacity of over 12 million. Imagine that, this is eternal torment on the grandest of scales.”<br><br>

              Serena was speechless—no words could describe the magnitude of the atrocity being perpetrated here. How might the knowledge of the existence of such a place as this affect humanity in its day-to-day dealings? Would it compel people to be kinder and gentler with one another? Would it persuade people to make peace with God and accept His terms of salvation? She wondered.<br><br>

              “Come, Serena, I have still more to show you.” Satan led his stunned companion across the rocky ground toward a nearby pair of crosses. He pointed toward the tall wooden instruments of agony before them. “I was inspired by the mind of man when I created this masterpiece, but as you can see, I have improved upon it as only I could. This means of inducing eternal pain is not as often utilized as the altar, oh no. There are less than 8,000 crosses on the hills surrounding this valley. The victims that call them eternal home are a special group, united by a common thread. During their lives they willingly chose to worship me. Some of these humans actually accepted God’s plan of salvation at one point in their miserable lives, yet they were like grains of wheat that fell amidst the thistle. As they grew, so did the thistle, and, in the end, that thistle choked them out.” Satan stopped momentarily, turning to Serena. “Do you understand the parable?”<br><br>

              “Yes sir, I think so. It’s in the Gospels. The thistle represents the cares and evil pleasures of the world.”<br><br>

              “Exactly,” satan said. “But these souls didn’t just turn their back on God, oh no, nothing so simple, they turned to me. Imagine that. You humans are so marvelously fickle. I have rewarded their devotion by allowing them to suffer for me, in my name, in much the same manner as Jesus suffered for you.”<br><br>

              Satan yanked once more on Serena’s hand, drawing her toward the two crosses, which faced out across the valley. Their victims, one a young man, the other a young woman, hung from the crosspieces by their nailed wrists, blood oozing from the wounds. The stout wooden crosses stood at least 15 feet tall, and the nailed feet of the victims hung better than 8 feet above the ground.<br><br>

              The young woman was dressed much as Serena was dressed, in a ragged gray skirt and a tattered top. Yet her attire was rather more revealing than Serena’s, especially in the position in which she found herself. The young man wore a small gray loincloth that scarcely covered his manhood.
              Their scant clothing offered virtually no protection from the elements, and the torn and shredded condition of their flesh told Serena that those elements extended far beyond the harsh sun and torrid breeze. It was obvious that the birds circling overhead frequently took the opportunity to feed upon their tortured bodies as well.<br><br>

              Around both of their necks hung a leather cord; and dangling from that cord was a golden amulet in the form of a five-pointed star. One vertex of the star pointed downward, while two others pointed upward. Serena recognized this sign as the inverted pentagram, the sign of satan. Drool oozed from the corner of their mouths and their breathing was exceptionally labored, as their arms were stretched to the limit by their own weight.
              Occasionally they would push upward on their nailed feet in an attempt to take some of the strain off their arms and chest. In this way they were able to breathe once more, but only at the cost of a different sort of pain. Their wide eyes followed the approach of the prince of darkness.<br><br>

              “Please, have pity on me, master,” said the young woman in a hoarse voice. “I served you as best I could during my life. I even sacrificed to you.
              Haven’t I suffered enough for you? Please, let me down!”<br><br>

              “What more do I need to do, master?” pleaded her companion. “I was loyal to you. You know I was. Why do you have to do this to me? Lord, what have I done that offended you?”<br><br>

              Satan stepped away from Serena and toward the crosses. “You have not offended me, but I require your worship, my children. Show me that you love me, tell me that you would suffer anything in my name, or I shall make your agony far worse!”<br><br>

              Satan began to raise his hand toward the two, yet the very threat of his wrath was sufficient to produce the desired response.<br><br>

              “Hail satan, our lord and master!” cried the woman, tears in her eyes.
              “All hail to the most high!”<br><br>

              “We worship you, master!” the young man said. “You are the only one for us, our only god.”<br><br>

              In their debilitated condition, they hardly seemed capable of lifting their voices in honor of he who had placed them upon their crosses, the author of their pain. Yet their praises echoed through the hills, for over a minute, a disjointed hymn of agony to their torturer.<br><br>

              “You are the great one!” cried the woman, fearful of being outdone by her companion, fearful of the consequences of being second best. “We worship your name. I would gladly suffer anything for you!”<br><br>

              “So would I!” her companion said. “I would suffer even more for you than she. Don’t you see, lord, I’m the one who is the most loyal to you.”<br><br>

              “No, I am,” objected the woman. “I would do anything for you, give you anything. I would suffer anything for your pleasure.”<br><br>

              Satan smiled broadly as his two victims each sought to outdo the other.<br><br>

              “And so you shall,” he replied, turning to depart, “for all eternity.”<br><br>

              Serena looked on in horror, tears in her eyes. Satan’s cruelty kept reaching new extremes. Why had he taken such an interest in her?<br><br>

              “While they lived, I gave them a vision of grandeur. I promised them a kingdom, a kingdom of millions that they could look out upon for all times.” Satan stretched out his hand to the countless altars below. “As you can see, I kept my word. They shall look over this valley forever, to behold their many subjects, who lay prostrate before them.<br><br>

              Serena gasped. This was an irony that only satan could appreciate. If anything, those who had faithfully served him were all the more subject to his wrath.<br><br>

              “There are others here who openly admitted to having no belief in me whatever,” continued satan. “Their worship was no more than play, an excuse to indulge themselves in their own lurid fantasies, for their own fleshly pleasures. Nevertheless they worshiped me, built ornate altars in my name, and conducted elaborate rituals to honor my own greatness. In light of all of that, their current situation is really quite humorous.”<br><br>

              “Humorous?” gasped Serena, astounded by satan’s choice in words.
              “Tragic might be a better term.”<br><br>

              Satan’s smile widened. “But that would depend upon your point of view, wouldn’t it?” Satan once more took Serena’s hand. “Let us move on, there is still more to see before I must leave you.”<br><br>

              Serena cautiously took the hand of the dark prince as a portal, similar to the one she had seen in the valley, opened before them. Walking through, they were immediately transported to another region of Hell. They stood near the base of a sheer cliff, towering 500 feet above them, overlooking the rough, rocky valley floor. Even as Serena watched, she was alarmed to see a human figure plummet from the top of the cliff to the valley below. He hit the ground with a terrible thud and a cry of excruciating pain. His cry blended in with the moans and lamentations of a multitude of others. Then another, a woman this time, was thrown from the precipice and slammed into the rocks below a few seconds later.<br><br>

              “We are only a few miles from where you began your journey,” satan said. “Your route to the sea of fire would not have taken you by this place, but I wanted you to see it, nonetheless. Let us take a closer look.” Satan roughly pulled Serena toward the impact point at the bottom of the cliff, even as a third and fourth victim were cast down from above.<br><br>

              Before them a great gathering of rag-clad bodies crushed and mutilated by the long fall, crawled and dragged themselves away upon shattered and twisted limbs. The presence of heavy shackles about their wrists and ankles made their journey all the more difficult.<br><br>

              They were urged along by the prods and whips of a multitude of devilish taskmasters. The horned demons who ruled over them were large and covered in coarse brown fur. They had sharp claw like hands and feet, and large black eyes. To Serena, their glistening eyes appeared almost insect-like. Their large mouths were filled with black, razor-sharp teeth, and their ears were exceptionally large and pointed. They were truly like something out of a nightmare.<br><br>

              The pathetic mounds of flesh before them moved as best they could amidst the clanking and rattling of their ponderous chains. They moved in a great barefoot procession along a treacherous yet heavily traveled pathway that led from the base of the cliff into the hills beyond.<br><br>

              “After their unfortunate fall from that cliff, these poor souls are urged by my minions to climb back up to the high precipice,” satan said while watching yet another victim of his wrath plunge from the heights. “It’s a difficult journey at first, with so many broken and shattered bones, ripped and bruised muscles, and severed tendons to contend with. But along the way, they heal, reconstruct themselves. Yet, that process of reconstruction is agonizing in itself, especially when the victim must use those bones and muscles quite vigorously in order to escape the whips and prods of the taskmasters. It takes nearly two hours to traverse the trail to the top. By the time they arrive, they are whole once more and ready to take the plunge again. Each one repeats the process without rest, throughout eternity.”<br><br>

              “It’s inhuman,” gasped Serena. “What did these people do to deserve such a horrible fate?”<br><br>

              “I wondered when you were going to ask,” laughed the devil. “They committed unnatural sexual acts. Men lusted after other men and women after other women. It is a futile pursuit, unable to bring about the miracle of procreation. Therefore, they who have committed it will spend the rest of eternity in this futile gesture of plummeting from the cliff, only to climb to the top once more and plummet from its heights again.”<br><br>

              Satan looked carefully into Serena’s eyes, then smiled. “You had perpetrated such an act as they, if only once. Perhaps you would like to join them, give this thing a try, just one or two rounds to get a feel for the routine. After all, the best way to understand a thing is to experience it first hand. Who knows, perhaps I could even be persuaded to adjust your sentence, condemn you to this place for all eternity rather than the sea of fire. You might prefer this. What do you say? Want to give it a try?”<br><br>

              Serena heard footsteps behind her. She turned to find one of the large hairy demons towering over her, a pair of open ankle and wrist shackles in his claw-like hands. Apparently, satan’s terrible offer hadn’t been a spur of the moment proposal—it had been well-planned.<br><br>

              Satan’s smile grew even wider. “See, all is in readiness, you just give the word and we can have you on the trail in no time.”<br><br>

              Serena struggled to remain in control. Yet, despite the intense heat of this place, a chill as cold as ice, swept through her body. Satan made it sound like an invitation, but would she be afforded the right of refusal?
              “Thank you, sir, but I think I’d rather not.”<br><br>

              Satan shrugged. “You might have found it an interesting experience, but as you wish, little one.” He motioned to the demon before them to go back to his assigned task. “You know, do you not, that you are only delaying the inevitable. The 12 hours of grace I have afforded you are as a flickering candle amidst the great darkness of eternity that lies ahead. When those fleeting hours have passed, you will be compelled to face your inevitable future. That future holds in store for you pain, an eternity of unimaginable agony. Pain will become your reality. It doesn’t really matter if it begins now or nine hours from now.”<br><br>

              Satan paused for another moment to watch two more poor souls fall to what would certainly have been their deaths anywhere else; but not here. “I never grow weary of the parade. Sadly time grows short, but there is one more thing I want you to see. I have saved the best for last. I suspect that you might appreciate what you shall witness next.”<br><br>

              Again a portal opened up before them, and a moment later the two vanished beyond it.<br><br>

              Serena felt the pleasantly cool air the instant she passed through the portal. A brisk wind was blowing at her back, while before her was a fantastic panorama of jagged mountains and valleys. Beyond the mountains was a level plain that ended in what appeared to be a great glowing sea of red that stretched to the distant horizon. The view was partially obscured by clouds of dust and smoke sweeping across the landscape below. She turned around to see still more mountains and the great red sun low in the sky.<br><br>

              They stood on the summit of what appeared to be the highest peak around. Overhead the sky was violet. For an instant, the memory of the horrors she had seen during the past hours faded, replaced by a sense of awe.<br><br>

              “Incredible!” gasped Serena.<br><br>

              “See, I told you that you would like it,” replied satan. “We are over a mile above the valley floor. From here you gain an entirely different perspective of my creation, a perspective that few of my guests ever experience.” Satan watched in amusement as the young woman scanned the horizon of the starkly beautiful environment.<br><br>

              “From here, who would possibly suspect what horrors lay below? From time to time, I come to this place, and other places like it, to get a breath of fresh air, to behold the world my hands have made.” There was a momentary pause. “What do you see, little one?”<br><br>

              Serena turned to look at the bloated red luminary hanging in the sky;
              then she turned to satan. “Sir, I see a barren dry planet circling a small red star, maybe the only planet and only star in all of outer darkness. It is its own small universe.”<br><br>

              Satan was rarely surprised, especially by a human, but this was one of those rare moments. “You see all of that from the top of this mountain?”<br><br>

              “Yes, sir,” Serena said, “You see, I studied a little astronomy in my time on Earth.”<br><br>

              “Speaking of time, my time is so very precious,” interrupted satan. “I have enjoyed your presence. I would like nothing better than to spend the entire day with you, and at its end, escort you to the sea of fire myself, where I might bid you a final farewell. It would be a date, as you humans call it, an opportunity for you to get to know me a little better. However, that is not to be.” There was a momentary pause.<br><br>

              “I have personally revealed to you the realm I have created. Who else could have done such a thing as this?” Satan raised his arms and turned slowly about to view the work of his own hand. “Surely, Serena, I am worthy of your worship; for truly, if I am not now your god, who is? Fall to your knees, little one, and do me homage—worship me.”<br><br>

              Well, there it was. Serena had feared that this moment was coming.
              Since the experience at the crosses on the hill she knew this time of decision was inevitable. This megalomaniac thrived upon worship, whether he was deserving of it or not. What was she to do now? Perhaps diplomacy?<br><br>

              “Sir, please understand, I’m very impressed with your accomplishments here; they are stunning. I respect your abilities.”
              Satan shook his head in disapproval. “Here, all beings refer to me as lord satan or just lord; for in this place, I am lord. Only you persist in calling me sir.”<br><br>

              “I call you sir out of respect,” countered Serena.<br><br>

              “But that is not sufficient,” replied satan with a trace of growing anger.
              “I require your worship. Kneel before me.”<br><br>

              Serena’s knees were shaking; she had run out of options. “Sir, throughout my entire life, I failed to worship God, the Creator of a hundred billion times a hundred billion stars, the Creator of the entire universe. I should have, but I didn’t. Now you ask me to worship you.” Again there was a pause. “Sir, if I failed to worship God, the true god, I cannot worship you.”<br><br>

              “Ah, but you worshiped a pagan goddess,” retorted satan. Then his anger ebbed once more and his expression softened. “Oh yes, I see that I have been going about this thing in the wrong way. How forgetful of me.
              Let me make this easier for you.”<br><br>

              Suddenly, satan’s form was in a state of metamorphosis. His skin color faded, his raiment became as white as snow. In a few seconds he had been transfigured into the form of a stunningly beautiful woman with long golden hair. This was the form that Serena had always associated with the goddess; the long flowing gown, the glowing countenance, it was all there.<br><br>

              “Now, you may worship me, Serena,” said the goddess, her voice soft and feminine. “I am here before you, the author of spring, the bringer of the harvest, the creator of all nature. Fall to your knees, and yield to me the honor that I am due.”<br><br>

              Serena was awestruck by the beauty, the majesty, of the goddess. For years she had been at the center of her life; yet now, for the first time, she understood the futility of such worship. She wasn’t real; she was a lie, a fabrication of the prince of lies. She had always been so. “I’m sorry, I can’t do that.”<br><br>

              “I could force you to worship me,” retorted the goddess, her voice suddenly angry. “I could cause you such agony, that you would do anything to bring it to an end.”<br><br>

              “I know you could,” replied Serena.<br><br>

              “And you still won’t worship me?”<br><br>

              Serena hesitated. Wasn’t the object here to reduce the pain as much as possible? “No, sir, I can’t.”<br><br>

              The imposing form of satan swiftly replaced the image of the goddess.
              Serena was surprised to find him smiling. “I believe you would resist me, for a while at least. Unfortunately, we don’t have the time to put you to the test, at least not right now. But answer me this; did you really believe in this goddess of yours? Answer me truly.”<br><br>

              Serena hesitated. In her youth she had performed rituals in the name of the goddess, burned incense to her, but had she truly believed? Did she have the same faith in the goddess that Chris had in his God, the true God, or was she just playing games? In more recent days, she had abandoned the rituals, beyond the occasional burning of incense. She looked toward satan who was still patiently awaiting her reply. “No, I don’t think I did.”<br><br>

              “So you surrendered your eternity for a thing you knew to be an illusion? You humans never cease to amuse me.” Satan once more extended his hand. “Come, little one.” Serena took his hand, as yet another portal materialized before them.<br><br>

              The trip through the portal brought Serena back to the very spot where her journey with the prince of darkness had begun.<br><br>

              “Here our paths shall part,” announced satan, releasing his companion’s hand. “You are indeed a strong-willed woman. I am relieved that you failed to respond to God’s calling. In His service, your courage and determination might have hindered some of my enterprises, but here, your courage means nothing. For now, you are brave and defiant, but I wonder how brave and defiant you will be a year from now, or ten years, or a hundred. Time is a thing we have in abundance. Will the agony that awaits you in the sea of fire make you more pliable? I think so.”<br><br>

              Satan turned to depart, then hesitated. “Oh, there is one final thing. We had a deal, you were not to interfere with the torments of any of my guests, remember? You have already violated that agreement once. I do not wish to see a repeat of that violation, least you suffer the consequences. Do we have an understanding?”<br><br>

              “Yes sir, I’m sorry,” Serena said, quivering in fear.<br><br>

              “Very well, then. Enjoy what remains of your precious freedom, little one.”<br><br>

              A portal of shimmering light appeared before the dark lord. He stepped through it, vanishing from sight. Shivering, Serena looked once more at the hourglass. Her time was running out with the sands. She had to continue the journey.<br><br>

              Serena was on the move once again. If she had ever held any hope in the depth of her heart, it was utterly gone now. How pliable would a year, or ten, or ten thousand in the sea leave her? Satan was right; in the end, she would probably do anything to be free of just a portion of the pain she would soon experience. How long would her ethical and moral fiber last?
              She feared that she would inevitably learn the answer.<br><br>

                    </p>


    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <!-- <p class="chapterTitle">The Vision</p> -->

            <p>
              FOR over an hour, the journey through the boulder-strewn valley was uneventful. No large birds of prey, no cries of pain, and no sign of a living thing met Serena’s senses. Yet things around her were changing nonetheless. The rocks and boulders had taken on a darker more porous nature, and the odor of sulfur had become perceptibly stronger. Here and there, traces of yellow elemental sulfur could be seen adhering to the dark rocks. <br><br>
              
              Serena claimed no expertise in geology, but it seemed all too obvious that she was approaching a volcanically active region. She thought back to her panoramic view from the lofty mountaintop. She had attempted to put what she had seen there to memory. There had been signs of smoke, perhaps some sort of volcanic venting in this area. It might well extend all the way to the sea of fire. It was, no doubt, a dangerous region to travel.<br><br>

              She pondered the possibility of hiding out, trying to evade satan and his minions. There were so many souls here; despite satan’s boasts, he and his legions couldn’t possibly watch everyone all the time. She recalled the haste with which the demons had restrained poor Karen to the altar. They had been eager to depart. Had they said something about being in a hurry to move on to others, about not having the time to mess around with her too long? She wasn’t sure. From what Serena had seen, they kept most of their human victims restrained by one means or another. Perhaps it was to keep them from resisting their tormentors, but perhaps it was something else.
              Perhaps it was to keep them in one place and accounted for.<br><br>

              There had been no demons watching over the valley of altars, at least Serena hadn’t noticed any. Perhaps she should have paid closer attention.
              They probably weren’t needed. After all, the victims of the altars weren’t going anywhere, were they? But maybe there was more to it than that.
              Maybe satan couldn’t spare the manpower, or in this case, the demonpower, to patrol it. Sure, there had been quite a hoard of demons at the cliff of falling souls, but perhaps that was an exception.<br><br>

              It seemed like a slim hope, but volcanic areas often held caves, lava tubes, that ran for miles underground. Perhaps she could find a place and hide out there. Perhaps satan would get sloppy, assume that Serena had leapt into the sea of fire and turn his attention elsewhere. Sure, spending a good part of eternity in a dark musty cave would be no picnic, but it would be better than spending eternity in the sea of fire.<br><br>

              Then again, satan had found her once, hadn’t he? He’d spent quite a bit of time showing her around. He had a special interest in her, of that much she was certain. In fact, he might be observing her at this very moment.
              Would he eventually lose interest in her? Probably, but by then she would be in the sea of fire. The devil would have her exactly where he wanted her, in a place from which there was no escape.<br><br>

              In the midst of her contemplation, Serena walked into an open area, free of large boulders. It was a bowl-shaped expanse of sand and small rocks, perhaps 100 feet wide, and at its center was a roughly circular pool of crystal clear liquid. Water? Oh, could she be so fortunate? Her ordeal of the past hours had taken her mind off her thirst, but it was there nevertheless.
              She cautiously ventured toward the pool, being vigilant of her surroundings, yet no dangers met her eyes.<br><br>

              She knelt down by the pool’s edge and slowly extended her hand into the liquid. Was it really water? Perhaps. The area around the pool had that special odor and feeling of moisture. Her hand penetrated the surface. It was warm but offered no burning sensation. She withdrew her hand and rubbed her fingers together. The liquid wasn’t slimy. She touched it to her tongue; it didn’t burn. She took a deep breath and cupped her hand to take a sip. The water had a slight taste of sulfur, but it wasn’t bad, after the long walk it was wonderful. She drank handful after handful until she had her fill. She had convinced herself that she would never again savor the wonderful taste of this nectar of life.<br><br>

              She undid her sandals and waded barefoot into the pool. It was a fantastic feeling. At the pool’s center, was a narrow tunnel that led into the depths. It confirmed Serena’s cave hypothesis. Too bad this one was underwater. She sat down on the sand in the knee-deep water, allowing the refreshing liquid to wash over her. It was like a warm bath. Perhaps she would manage to clean the putrid rags that clothed her.<br><br>

              Almost as an afterthought, she noticed that a froth of small bubbles was rising from the small dark cave at the bottom of the pool. “A hot spring,” she said while splashing herself with warm water. “I could open a resort here—a five star hotel, the best accommodations. The marketing brochure would read: Serena’s Hot Spring. Get away from the cold winters, right here in the heart of Hell. That has a nice ring to it. But, the trouble is— everyone here is shackled or otherwise restrained, and the demons are too busy tormenting them to take a vacation. Too bad.”<br><br>

              It was several minutes before Serena again glanced over at the bubbles rising from the cave below the pool. There were more of them now, and they were bigger. The water was becoming warmer, and that warmth was coming from the cave. She rose to her feet to take a better look. The water above the cave was becoming frothy with effervescence. Serena sensed danger and backed away. She reached the shoreline, and was in the process of putting on her sandals when the real eruption began. Water burst from the depths, spouting a dozen feet in the air for the better part of a minute.
              Serena stepped back as the pool grew to nearly twice its volume. Then, as abruptly as it had begun, the eruption ceased, and an uneasy calm returned to the now steamy pool.<br><br>

              Serena cautiously dipped her hand into the now turbid water, to discover that it was indeed very hot, much hotter than before. Had she not escaped the pool when she did, she might well have been severely scalded.<br><br>

              She figured that, like the geysers of Yellowstone, this one probably erupted on a regular schedule. Another useless scientific observation to the credit of the explorer who would never return to the world of the living to recap the wonders and horrors she had beheld in this strange world.<br><br>

              Serena left the misty pool behind, continuing her trek down the dismal valley. Here the terrain seemed less rugged. There were fewer large boulders, so she made better time, and she had a more unobstructed view of any dangers ahead of her. In the distance, she saw vast clouds of vapor rising from the valley floor, probably steam from other geysers. A large portion of the valley floor seemed to abruptly drop off as if a section of the valley had collapsed. As Serena drew closer she could hear the now all too familiar sounds of a multitude of tormented waling souls.<br><br>

              “What now?” she said, walking cautiously toward the source of the commotion.<br><br>

              Before her was a great pit. It was several miles in diameter, and perhaps 50 feet deep, surrounded on all sides by shimmering, slimy, nearly vertical walls of rock and mud. The bottom of the pit was covered with a roiling, turbulent lake of brown mud, whose heat and stench was so great that Serena was overwhelmed, even from where she stood. It was like a mammoth cesspool. Within this horrible pit was a great multitude of men and women, reeling, swimming, and splashing about, their flesh as red as fire. The scene reminded Serena of lobsters boiling in a pot. Serena had always hated that because it seemed so cruel; but to see it happening to human beings was unimaginable.<br><br>

              As Serena watched, she noticed that some regions of the pit were deeper than others, for the victims in those regions were compelled to swim through the viscous boiling mire; while in other places, the mud was scarcely ankle deep. Realizing this, the great throng of rag-clad humans struggled to reach the shallows, battling each other savagely, striving to occupy the most prime locations of the great pit. It was a constant struggle for those fortunate few to maintain their stations of least agony, for always there were those within the surging crowd who sought to take it from them.<br><br>

              Still others clawed at the sides of the pit with bloody, lacerated fingers, searching for any handhold that might allow them, if not to escape the pit, to at least pull them up and out of the boiling mire. All were futile attempts.
              Though some managed to climb some distance above the roiling filth, the slopes were too steep and slippery. Inevitably they too were pulled back into the foul cauldron by others seeking escape. And so it continued—an eternity of struggling and pain.<br><br>

              Even as Serena watched, a dark figure swooped out of the sky. In his arms he held a squirming, screaming man. He descended over the great pit like a mighty bird of prey, then cast the poor soul into the boiling lake of squalor below. With his burden shed, the dark figure soared into the misty sky and out of sight.<br><br>

              “Do you wish to know what their sin was?”<br><br>

              Serena turned abruptly to see an angelic being, very handsome, robed totally in black. His deep blue eyes looked into Serena’s with such intensity.
              His dark wings were folded tightly to his back. Were it not for the darkness of his apparel and the circumstances of their meeting, Serena might have mistaken him for one of the angels who allied themselves with God, the Creator.<br><br>

              A look of concern appeared on his face. “I hope that I have not startled you, for that was not my intent.”<br><br>

              He had startled her, quite thoroughly, but Serena was not about to admit to it. “It’s OK,” she said, quickly regaining her composure.<br><br>

              “Lord satan has commanded that you be treated as an honored guest until such time as the sand within your hourglass runs its course.” The dark angel motioned to the great pit. “This is a place for those who took advantage of the less fortunate, the poor, the downtrodden. It is a realm of those unethical individuals who advanced themselves at the cost of others, who forgot kindness and mercy, and thought only of their own gain. Now and forever, they struggle to escape the boiling foulness that is the scourge of their world. They pull, push, claw, shove, and strike one another in an attempt to escape the scalding caustic slime, if only for a moment. Sadly, all of their victories are temporary…and in the end, meaningless.”<br><br>

              “Ghastly,” gasped Serena.<br><br>

              “But so was the way in which they lived their lives,” retorted the dark angel. “Cruel were their methods and cruel are their rewards. You humans like to think in such complex terms; but in the end, it is just that simple.”<br><br>

              “But the tortures here are so extreme,” objected Serena. “I mean, these people committed these sins for, what, 60 or 70 years? But you torture them for eternity. How is that fair?”<br><br>

              “It is the nature of things,” explained the dark angel. “Your few years on Earth are the most important ones of your eternity. They determine your path forever, your destiny.” The dark angel motioned to the right. Here the great pit seemed to meet the high cliff wall that formed the edge of the valley.<br><br>

              “That is the best route around the pit. Stay to that side of the valley, the south side, on your way to the sea of fire, it is the safest way.”<br><br>

              Serena nodded. “Thank you.”<br><br>

              The dark angel smiled a devious smile as he bowed before the young woman in a mendacious courtesy. Then he turned, spread his dark wings, and leapt into the sky. His great wings created a virtual whirlwind as he climbed swiftly away. Serena was knocked to the ground by the blast. For a moment she feared that the blast might actually cast her into the terrible pit behind her, yet the powerful gale was short-lived. She turned to see the demonic form decrease in size as it climbed into the mists. She suspected that the entire incident was not a careless oversight, but a very deliberate act.<br><br>

              Serena continued on her journey. Making certain to leave a safe distance between her and the edge of the pit, she was forced to take a significant detour. Occasionally she glanced into the huge stinking caldera to see the eternal struggling within. What a terrible fate—perhaps worse than the black altars. The constant cries depressed her, reminding her of where she was and her eternal future.<br><br>

              The great chasm spanned the entire width of the valley, leaving only about 20 yards of level terrain between the yawning precipice of the pit and towering mountain cliffs at the narrowest point. It was well over an hour before she finally left the terrible chasm behind.<br><br>

              Before her was a great field of mighty geysers that were scattered across the entire width of the valley. Towering plumes of water thundered up from a valley floor encrusted with salts of white and yellow. This place made Yellowstone pale by comparison. There were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of geysers.<br><br>

              At any given time several of them roared with activity, thrusting water high above the steamy plain. Some took the form of narrow pillars of vapor and liquid, while others threw a wide fan of water across the barren landscape. There were plumes that possessed a trace of blue, green, or brown, bearing witness to the presence of local minerals. One geyser would erupt, then another, some distance away. There seemed to be no discernable pattern to the eruptions.<br><br>

              Traveling through this geothermal field might be a trick akin to traversing an earthly minefield. If Serena was near one of the vents when a geyser erupted, thousands of gallons of boiling hot water would engulf her.
              The receding flood might even sweep her into the vent as the eruption subsided and the geyser reclaimed its boiling hoard. It was a frightening prospect, but there seemed little choice; she was off.<br><br>

              She moved quickly, keeping a close eye on her surroundings. She had never been to Yellowstone and wondered if there was any warning before a geyser blew its top. She might just find out the hard way.<br><br>

              The ground shook frequently as she continued, and the air was full of the rumble of water and steam thundering up from the depths. Here and there, she spotted dark forms in the sky, flying in apparently random patterns above the valley floor. Occasionally they seemed to dive at the ground and then pull up before hitting the surface. At first she figured them to be large birds, like the ones she had seen around the black altars, but as one flew almost directly overhead, she realized that they were large-winged demons. What were they up to? She couldn’t say; but whatever it was, it consumed their interest. Serena disregarded the demons, focusing her full concentration on the path ahead of her.<br><br>

              During the next half-hour, Serena’s route did not carry her particularly close to any of the geysers, for which she was most grateful. The most active region of the field seemed to be along the far side of the valley. That was fine by her. She preferred to view these geothermal wonders from a respectable distance. Perhaps that was why the demon she had encountered at the edge of the pit had steered her in this direction, out of concern. Sure it was; these demons were deeply concerned for the humans under their charge. It was all the more reason to be suspicious of their advice.<br><br>

              Serena discovered a lone vent directly in her path. The slightest trace of steam issued from the salt-encrusted opening. She swallowed hard. She had kept a careful eye on her selected route, and this particular geyser hadn’t erupted in the last half hour. She wondered if that increased or decreased the danger. She looked for a detour, but other paths would only lead her closer to more active vents. There was no way around it, she had to continue.<br><br>

              As she drew closer, her sandals made a grinding sound on the wet, briny salt deposits. She saw small pools of water here and there confirming that this geyser had erupted in recent times. Judging from the distance to the vent, when it erupted, it threw scalding hot water over a wide area. This was not good. She hoped that there would be some warning before the next eruption.<br><br>

              She was less than 50 feet from the vent when she noticed a coal-black chain coming out of the mouth of the geyser. A chill swept through her. “Oh God, not again,” she gasped. Once more she considered taking another route, steering as far from this vent as possible, but in the end she stayed the course. What horrors were within the geyser? She had to know; she had to better understand her adversary.<br><br>

              Serena drew to within a few feet of the mouth of the geyser. The formidable chain was firmly attached to a heavy stone block set into the ground. From there it led into a roughly circular vent, less than a yard in diameter. The chain seemed under tension, as if holding a considerable weight. From the depths of the vent, Serena heard moaning. It was a woman’s voice, she was certain of it. Cautiously she approached the hellish well and peered in. All she saw was darkness, so she dropped to her knees to get a better look—a foolhardy act.<br><br>

              Perhaps 15 or 20 feet down into the semi-darkness she saw the form of a young woman about her own age. She had long, brown hair, wet, and matted, a slender yet muscular build, and a pale complexion. She hung limply from the chain by her shackled wrists, which were extended high above her head. For a moment she looked lifeless, yet sensing the presence above her, the woman slowly lifted her head. At first what she saw didn’t seem to register; then her eyes opened wide with surprise.<br><br>

              “Who are you?” she gasped.<br><br>

              “My name is Serena.”<br><br>

              “No, you’re just an illusion, you can’t be real.”<br><br>

              “I assure you, I am,” Serena said, glancing again at the black chain. She remembered satan’s warning about assisting the victims of Hell’s fury, but right now she didn’t care. “Look, I’m not that strong, but maybe we can work together and get you up out of there. At least we can try.”<br><br>

              “What a kind offer,” replied the woman, her voice languid and weary.
              “But there’s a problem with that.” She swung her shackled feet back and forth, revealing that they were not only chained together but linked to three other chains that radiated downward and were mounted securely to the tunnel wall at three places, perhaps a dozen feet farther into the depths. “It didn’t used to be like this,” she continued, “but I guess I was a bad girl.”<br><br>

              “How long have you been here?” asked Serena, leaning farther over the dark opening.<br><br>

              The woman shook her head slowly. “I really couldn’t tell you. I died in October 1983. How long ago was that?”
              “Twenty-four years and two months,” replied Serena.
              Again the woman shook her head. “Has it been that long? After a while here, time seems to lose its meaning.”<br><br>

              “I only wish that there was something I could do for you,” lamented Serena.<br><br>

              “So do I. By the way, my name is Gwen, Gwen Thomas. And let’s see, I guess I’m 44 years old.”<br><br>

              “How can you go on?” Serena asked. “How do you stand it? How do you keep from losing your mind?”<br><br>

              “You go on because you have to,” replied Gwen. “I don’t know how others react to this place…you see, I’m sort of isolated. I guess many scream and curse and cry, but what good does it do? After it’s all over and you’ve screamed yourself hoarse, or cried your eyes dry, you’re still here.
              All you can do is take it, and somewhere deep in your soul, hope that someday there will be an end to it all.” Gwen hesitated.<br><br>

              “But tell me, Serena, how is it that you are wandering around loose up there? I can hardly imagine satan letting the likes of you run free. That sadistic pig loves to put women in chains and torture them.”<br><br>

              “I’m not as free as you think,” lamented Serena. “I guess satan has just given me a little time to think about it before he starts working on me, before I begin my eternity in the sea of fire.”<br><br>

              “Sea of fire…that sounds nasty,” Gwen said, staring up at Serena.
              “I guess I’m going to find out,” replied Serena.
              “No, we don’t want to talk about things like that, I want to hear about you,” said Gwen. “I so desperately need to hear another human voice. I haven’t heard another human voice in so many years. I want to understand who you are. I want to hear about anything but this place.”<br><br>

              Serena did her best to describe her life on Earth, and the situation that brought her here to Gwen. When it was over, Gwen shook her head sadly.<br><br>

              “Being separated from your husband must make it all the worse. As for this little slice of freedom satan granted you, I don’t think the pig did you any favor.” A momentary groan emanated from Gwen’s lips as she pulled upon her chains. “I really didn’t leave anyone behind. Maybe it’s better that way.”<br><br>

              Serena’s next question was natural enough. “Tell me about you, Gwen.
              I’ve been doing all the talking.”<br><br>

              “I’m not much for talk anymore,” said Gwen, “but, in a word, I was a prostitute.”
              “Why?” asked Serena, who only now realized how potentially offensive her question was.<br><br>

              “Because it meant escape and money,” replied Gwen. “I thought it was the only way I could support myself. Life had screwed me over pretty bad growing up, so I decided to screw it back, and I didn’t come cheap. If men wanted me, fine, but they paid. You see, I had dreams, Serena, and I wasn’t afraid to take chances to reach them.”<br><br>

              “What kind of dreams?”<br><br>

              “I was a gymnast, and I was very good. The rings, the parallel bars, the horse, I did it all. My greatest dream was to make it to the summer Olympics, to bring home the gold. From white trash to Olympic gold— there’s a dream. But it takes more than talent, it takes money to do all that. I paid for it by selling off my dignity, my self-respect.”<br><br>

              “Did you ever get to the Olympics?” asked Serena.<br><br>

              “No, I never got the chance. Maybe I should have quit my night job sooner, maybe I got a little greedy. I had enough money, and more. It was right there, all tucked away in CDs. Maybe that’s why this all happened to me. Maybe that’s why I’m here.”<br><br>

              There was a pause. Gwen gasped, pulling on her shackles. A trickle of blood flowed from beneath her left wrist restraint and down her arm. Serena could only imagine the strain on Gwen’s arms and legs especially because of the barbs that lined the inside of her shackles. It had to be pure agony.<br><br>

              “I was always a high class girl, and I was an outlaw, through and through.”<br><br>

              “An outlaw?” asked Serena.<br><br>

              “Yeah, what I mean is that I didn’t have a pimp, I ran the whole show myself. Men only want women for what they can get out of them. No male pig was going to run my life; take all the profits, while I took all the risks.
              No, I was calling the shots, choosing my own clients. And I catered to the best. You know, I always figured that if something did happen to me, that it would be one of my clients that would do it, but it wasn’t.<br><br>

              “No, it happened to me on my way back to my car after a particularly busy night. I was tired, sore, ready to get a few hours of sleep before a long day at the gym. It all happened so fast. To this day I don’t know exactly what went down. All I know is that this guy pulled me into an alley and slit my throat wide open. It was a horrible feeling, a sickening pain. The rest is history.”<br><br>

              Serena only nodded. What could she say that would make any difference?<br><br>

              “Satan took great pleasure in sentencing me to this hellish hole in the ground,” continued Gwen. “He was such a pompous ass sitting on his throne; lord of all he surveyed. Forget anything noble I might have done during my life; he focused only on my months of prostitution. He acted as if I had been doing it my whole life, as if I had enjoyed it. He said that because I had tried so hard to hide my sins from the light of society, that he would torment me for it in a hidden dark place, where I would feel the heat of his wrath. He sentenced me to this place. Two of his dark demons carried me here. They shackled me hand and foot, and threw me into the throat of this steamy hot geyser.”<br><br>

              “I’m sorry,” said Serena.<br><br>

              “Not as much as I am,” retorted Gwen. “When the chain went tight that first time, it nearly pulled my arms out of their sockets. They told me all about this place as I hung there—about the game.”<br><br>

              “Game?” asked Serena.<br><br>

              “Oh yes, game,” confirmed Gwen. “The rules are quite simple, really.
              They told me about the eruptions, about the scalding hot water that exploded out of this geyser every few hours. When it happened, I’d more than likely be thrown out by the sheer force of the eruption. But you see, the throat of this geyser was my prison, and my sanctuary. To be safe from the demons, I had to remain inside, always.<br><br>

              “If the erupting waters threw me out, I was to scramble back in as fast as I could. If they managed to catch me outside, they won, and got the pleasure of hacking me up with their claws, before throwing me back into the geyser again. There I’d hang by my chain, healing, waiting until the next round, the next eruption. If I managed to get back in before they caught me, I was safe, but I still lost, if you get my meaning.”<br><br>

              Serena got it. Then a terrible thought hit her. “How often does this thing erupt?”<br><br>

              “You don’t have to worry,” assured Gwen. “As best I can figure, there are about five or six hours between eruptions. Most of the time, I just hang here in this steamy heat and suffer, alone. I get a lot of time to think down here, between eruptions. I don’t know, maybe that’s the worst part. But the eruptions; they’re terrifying. Believe me; you don’t even want to know what that feels like. The rumbling starts about a minute before the scalding water reaches you. The heat increases, you can hear it coming, a roaring sound from far below, growing louder and louder; it’s terrifying as the boiling water works its way through the narrow cracks in the rock below this cauldron I hang in.<br><br>

              “There is a blast of scalding hot air and steam that hits me first; then I can see it, a frothing boiling mass, bursting out of the darkness. If engulfs me in seconds. The violent turbulence tosses me against the walls, cutting me up real bad, before it pushing me up and out of the vent. I quickly run out of chain and am yanked hard, thrown to the ground, showered in boiling hot water. It lasts for about a minute, but it seems so much longer.”<br><br>

              Gwen began to gasp as she flailed around at the end of her chain. Serena could see the pain in her eyes as she pulled in futility upon her bonds. She grunted and groaned as tears came to her eyes, shimmering in the faint light. Then she went still again.<br><br>

              “Are you OK?” asked Serena.<br><br>

              “Not hardly,” said Gwen. “It’s just cramps, that’s all, they’ll pass.” It was over a minute before she could continue. “I remember that first eruption. When it was over, I was left dazed and confused, out there on the plains. I looked like a lobster—red and covered with boils. It was horrible. I was in such pain. The gritty salt all around me made it all the worse. Then I looked a little ways away to see another poor soul who had also been thrown from her geyser. For a moment she laid there, just like me.<br><br>

              “Then, one of those black demons pounced on her. He came out of nowhere. He clawed at her, ripping huge chunks of her flesh away with his sharp talons. Blood and guts were flying everywhere. The whole time she just screamed. What else could she do?<br><br>

              She couldn’t die again. Then, he threw what was left of her into the vent of her geyser, and turned to me. I scrambled for the still steaming vent. I barely managed to plunge back in before he arrived. He cursed at me, taunted me from up there for the longest while, then he left.”<br><br>

              Serena shivered as she pictured that horrible moment, and she could picture it only too well.<br><br>

              “I hung there for a long time,” continued Gwen. “Then I decided to do something, I put my skills as a gymnast to work. I reached for the chain attached to my wrist shackles and began to climb. It wasn’t easy, but slowly I made my way up the chain to the surface. Reaching the top, I looked around; no demons in sight, I crawled out. I looked for any way that I might release these shackles, or bust the chain anchored into the rocks, but I couldn’t figure it out. All the while, I kept an eye out for the black demons.
              I could see them in the distance all right, but none of them came anywhere near me. They focus on the erupting geysers to find their victims, there was no point in checking up on the quiet geysers because their occupants were trapped inside, hanging from the end of their chains. They are all women, former prostitutes, hardly the sort who were going to find the strength to climb up the chains to get out. And hauling them out was against the rules.”<br><br>

              “So, what did you do?” asked Serena.<br><br>

              “For a time I just sat there, trying to keep a low profile. Eventually I felt the rumbling of the geyser as it prepared to erupt again. I tried to get as far away from it as I could, which wasn’t very far. Still I was able to escape the worst of the spray. Sure, I got burned some, but nothing like the first time.
              When the eruption was over, I made for the vent. Sure enough, there was one of those black demons on its way toward me, but I was able to duck into the vent before he got anywhere close. I hung on to the chain, watched him from just inside the vent until he turned away in search of other victims. After a few minutes, I was out once more.<br><br>

              “During the next few days, the cycle repeated again, and again, a game of cat and mouse. It was tiresome, stressful, and often painful, but it sure beat the alternative. It was then when I began to think of eternity in a different way. Like rainfall wearing down a tall mountain, might I wear down my chains, given enough time? There were plenty of rocks, very hard ones, all around. The chains between my wrist shackles gave me about 2 feet of play, enough to wield the rocks.<br><br>

              “At first I tried to use them as a hammer. I decided to work on the chain between my ankle shackles first. After all, if I couldn’t run, I’d have no chance. I decided to work on what I thought was the weak link in the chain, where it met the shackle. For weeks I struck that link. I managed to bend it way forward and way back time and time again. That’s supposed to break a link eventually, right?”<br><br>

              “But aren’t your shackles barbed on the inside?” asked Serena.<br><br>

              “Yes, and that made it hurt all the more,” replied Gwen. “With every blow of the rock, those barbs dug into my ankles, but I didn’t seem to be getting anywhere. If I couldn’t remove the shackles from my leg, well, there was only one solution, wasn’t there?”<br><br>

              Serena realized where this conversation was leading. “Oh my God, you thought of amputating your foot?”<br><br>

              “Exactly,” replied Gwen, “it was the only way. Cut the foot off, pull the shackle from the stump, then reattach the foot. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? I just wasn’t all that sure that I had the guts to do it. I knew my foot would grow back together in an hour or so, but how do you do such a thing to yourself. I thought of stories of desperate animals who chewed off a leg that was caught in a trap. It is a lot easier said than done. Nonetheless, I started working on a large narrow rock, sharpening it into a blade. Still it took me a long time to work up the nerve to do it.”<br><br>

              Serena shivered at the very thought, it was ghastly. Only in this place would anyone possibly come up with such a scheme.<br><br>

              “I don’t think I’ll go into the details, of cutting off a foot and then reattaching it. It can be done, but believe me, you can’t imagine what it’s like. Cutting through flesh, and then bone; it was horrible. And when you start, you’ve got to see it through to the end, no matter what. I don’t cry easily, but I did then. Those two days were the worst days of my eternity, but somehow, I got through it. When it was over and the healing was complete, I just stared at my bare feet. It was wonderful to have them free again, but what I wouldn’t have given for a pair of shoes. I buried the shackles beneath some rocks and prepared to do my wrists.”<br><br>

              “Had you thought any about where you planned to go when you finally got free?” asked Serena, looking for a moment around the valley. “I mean, where could you go? This place is so open, surely you’d be seen.”<br><br>

              “I’d thought a lot about it,” was the reply. “I wasn’t about to go through all of this, just to get caught again. There was a way; I’d thought my way all through it. But I guess I didn’t think about it quite enough. Anyway, I never got the chance to make the break. It was after I did my left wrist that the black demons caught up with me. I’d slipped back into the vent, was waiting until the coast was clear, when two of the demons showed up. They grabbed my chain and pulled me out. I think they knew what had been going on for quite a while. Maybe they’d just been playing with me, waiting for me to almost get free before catching me. They clawed me up real bad;
              then they put the shackles on me again and threw me back into the vent. But they didn’t stop there. They climbed down into the vent, crawling along the walls like some sort of insects. They added extra chains to my feet, shackling them to the walls to keep me inside the vent. They said that because I didn’t play fair, that I wouldn’t be allowed to play the game at all.
              And that’s the way it’s been ever since.”<br><br>

              “I’m sorry,” said Serena. “I know that doesn’t mean much, but I am.”<br><br>

              “And do you think you’re any better off than I?” asked Gwen, a crazed anger in her voice. “I don’t know what you’ll experience in the sea of fire. I don’t even know exactly what the sea of fire looks like, but I think I’ll take this over that any day.”<br><br>

              Serena drew back from the gaping hole in the ground. Gwen might be right. What was the sea of fire? She wasn’t really sure. Continually being burned alive might make Gwen’s ordeal seem like a picnic by comparison.<br><br>

              “We’re both damned, you and I,” continued Gwen. “I can offer you only one consolation, for whatever it’s worth. The experience of continual and unending pain has a dulling effect on your senses, you’ll see. Eventually your mind learns to block a large portion of the pain out. It’s still terrible, don’t get me wrong, but not quite as bad as you might imagine. It becomes a part of you, like breathing. You come to forget what existence without it is like. Life without pain might even seem empty. You’ll understand.” There was a pause, then suddenly Gwen’s voice took on an alarmed aspect. “I can’t do it, I can’t! Run, Serena, run! This geyser is going to erupt, I can feel it! I can’t keep you here. I don’t care what he does to me, run!”<br><br>

              Serena rose to her feet. She was confused and didn’t know what to do.<br><br>

              “Run, Serena!” gasped Gwen. “You’ve gotta get out of here!”<br><br>

              Serena backed slowly away from the vent, then turned and ran.<br><br>

              It was less than a minute before she felt the rumble beneath her feet, followed by the roar behind her. She turned to behold the tower of scalding water rising high into the sky. Had she stayed a moment longer, she would have been engulfed in its fury. What was Gwen talking about? Was she under orders to delay her? Serena quickened her pace. She felt as if she had been set up. The dark demon had directed her down this path, perhaps anticipating her meeting with Gwen. Had he been behind it all, or might there have been higher powers at work here? She figured that she would never know.<br><br>

              Yet one thing was certain; there was no escape from her fate, no hiding from the prince of darkness. He held absolute sway over his realm, and nothing happened here that he was unaware of. Hell was as much about hopelessness as it was about pain. Soon she would know both.<br><br>

                  </p>


  <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
  <!-- <p class="chapterTitle">The Vision</p> -->

            <p>
              SERENA’S journey through the realm of the geysers continued for nearly two hours. Under different conditions, it might have been a fantastic experience. Yet, she knew the dark secret these deadly fountains held, the human tragedy locked up in this wonder of nature. She could only imagine how many of these vents contained souls in torment, souls waiting helplessly for the blistering hot fury from below to be expelled, only to be compelled to scramble once more into their dark prison to escape the demons above. It was a nightmarish cycle. Now and again, she could hear the muted, mournful cries of the inhabitants of this defiled natural wonder. <br><br>

              Eventually the field of the geysers came to an end, and the valley opened into a vast featureless plain, an expanse of flat nothingness that extended to the horizon. She had seen this region from the mountaintop, through the mists and smoke that dominated this wretched land. The way she figured, the sea of fire was not far off. She had come a long way. She glanced at the small hourglass. She was dismayed to discover that more than half of the sand had run its course. Her time was running out.<br><br>

              “No hope,” she sighed, as she continued on.<br><br>

              Serena discovered that the plains before her were not as featureless as she had at first thought. Scattered here and there among the rocks and gravel were white-bleached bones. Certainly not mountains of them, but bones nonetheless, cast helter-skelter across the landscape. So scattered and fragmented were these remnants that Serena was unsure as to whether they were of human or animal origin. The source of the carnage was a mystery, but it was obvious that it happened a very long time ago. In the absence of rain or insects, it was hard to say just how fast animal remains might deteriorate here. Human bodies would regenerate, and Serena suspected the same was true for the fallen angels. So, what about these bones? It was a question with no answer.<br><br>

              Looking up from the bones, Serena saw an orange glow on the horizon.
              At first she thought it might be the edge of the sea of fire, but as she grew closer it took on the appearance of a myriad of campfires, spaced at regular intervals across the landscape. It seemed to be an encampment of a mighty army that stretched as far as she could see. Above the fires, a multitude of large dark forms flew through the ragged skies.<br><br>

              “What now?” moaned Serena, who was weary of the pain and suffering she had witnessed on her tragic journey.<br><br>

              She looked for a route around whatever lay ahead, but there appeared to be none. All she could do was continue to follow her shadow into oblivion.<br><br>

              Eventually, she had drawn close enough to see the true nature of the fires. They were bowl-shaped pits, perhaps 4 or 5 feet deep and twice that wide. The walls and floor of the pits were lined with glowing red hot rocks, and the air held the intense stench of brimstone. Most of the pits contained the writhing forms of the damned—moaning and screaming, many fully engulfed in flames. Their forms rippled and quivered amidst the waves of rising heat. So great was the heat of the pit, that their bodies had been reduced to nothing more than skeletal remains. The flesh that sought to regenerate was swiftly swept away, dropping from their bones and into the pit, where it was swiftly incinerated within the blazing inferno. Even the eyes of these damned souls had been swept away by the flames, leaving nothing but dark empty sockets staring out at the world.<br><br>

              Within their rib cage and surrounding the bones of the legs and arms, a gray turbulent mist swirled like smoke, yet never escaped. Was it smoke from their continually vaporizing flesh, swirling in the eddies created by the intense heat? Or was it something more substantial, something more precious? Perhaps it was the physical manifestation of their eternal souls?<br><br>

              Still, the most incongruous aspect of these damned souls was the worms. The porous, light gray bones were teaming with white worms that seemed totally unaffected by the intense heat. They crawled in and out, as if feeding upon the slim remains of these skeletal apparitions that had once been human beings.<br><br>

              Serena had seen many horrible things since her arrival here, but this was the most ghastly of them all. With no flesh, no lungs, and no tongues, how could these people scream so? Serena was amazed that the bones of these hapless individuals remained assembled in the form they had taken in life.
              With no muscle or sinew to hold them together, why didn’t these scorched skeletal members fall to the ground, to become no more than a pile of litter scattered across the bottom of the pit? And the worms, how could they possibly survive under conditions such as these?<br><br>

              The pits emitted such heat that, even from a distance of 10 or 15 feet, their radiance was absolutely brutal. She could hardly imagine what it must be like from within. Surely the laws of reason, of physics, no longer applied here. They had been indefinitely suspended at the whim of the prince of darkness.<br><br>

              Overhead, hundreds of demons cloaked utterly in black guarded the pits. Well, so much for her theory about a shortage of demon power. Satan seemed to have no lack of resources.<br><br>

              The walls of the small pits were steep, but not insurmountable. So what force held these poor souls in their primitive crematoriums? Was it the fear of the dark horde above them, or were they so weakened by their ordeal that they had no strength to escape?<br><br>

              The pits before her were widely scattered enough to allow her easy passage, at least physically easy. Emotionally, it was another story entirely.
              Her fortitude and courage were failing her. As pointless as it might have been, she offered a brief prayer before she took another step toward the plain of tormented souls. It was not only a prayer of mercy for her, but for them. It was a prayer for strength that she, the condemned prisoner, might be able to continue on her final journey. She moved forward.<br><br>

              Serena tried to focus on the path before her rather than the carnage around her. Surprisingly, none of the damned souls called out to her as she passed by. Perhaps they lacked the ability to see or hear her. Perhaps all they could sense was the searing pain carried upon the flames that leapt up from the embers beneath them. Perhaps their personalities, memories, and consciousness had perished in the flames, leaving only their primal urge for survival. No, that would be too merciful.<br><br>

              Serena’s attention was caught by a commotion not far away. Turning, she discovered that one of the skeletons had scrambled from his pit, only to encounter a black demon in the process. Already, the skeleton had started to develop internal organs and the beginnings of flesh.<br><br>

              “I can’t stand it anymore!” he screamed, flailing wildly in the demon’s grasp. “You gotta let me out.” His cries quickly turned to sobbing pleas.<br><br>

              “I’ll do anything you want, but please, don’t put me back in there, please!”<br><br>

              The demon effortlessly picked him up by his bony neck, held him out at arm’s length. “So you can’t stand it?”
              “I can’t,” cried the man. “Please, it hurts so much. I’m going out of my mind! Please, let me out of here, please!”<br><br>

              The demon cast the poor man back into the pit, but not before ripping a skeletal leg from him. The small quantity of flesh that had formed on this poor soul’s bones, virtually dissolved as the pit erupted in flames that towered 10 feet into the sky. When the flames died down once more, Serena witnessed a bare skeleton, flailing around upon the coals.<br><br>

              “So, you can’t stand it,” said the demon, in a sadistic sneer. “OK, let’s see how you like laying in your pit rather than standing in it. It will take days for that bony leg to regenerate in there. That should be enough time for you to ponder the consequences of trying to escape. And if you do try to escape again, I’ll rip you into a dozen pieces, and scatter them across the desert. I’ll show you a new aspect of pain.”<br><br>

              Serena looked fearfully toward the dark demon, yet he gave her but a passing glance before returning to the sky with the prize leg in tow. The mystery of the bones in the desert had been solved, though Serena could have lived without that knowledge. It was best that she moved on, putting this place behind her as quickly as she could.<br><br>

              As the minutes passed, it became apparent that at least some of the skeletal beings around her sensed her presence, for they cried out to her as she passed, begging for help. But what could she do? If she managed to pull a tormented soul from their pit, one of the demons circling overhead would simply cast them back in, perhaps doing the same to her in the process.
              Right now, the demons seemed unconcerned by her presence, but if she interfered that might quickly change.<br><br>

              “Please, have mercy upon me!” cried a skeleton nearby. Only the nature of his voice told Serena that this was a human of male gender, and from his accent, she deduced he was of Spanish or Hispanic descent. “Oh please, save me!”<br><br>

              Serena turned to see him, and was sickened by the multitude of white worms crawling in and out of his bones, like maggots.<br><br>

              “Won’t you please help me?” he pleaded.<br><br>

              Serena gazed into his vacant bony eye sockets. The man wept in dry heaves, as he knelt in the middle of his glowing hot pit surrounded by searing waves of heat. His skeletal hands reached for the worms that infested his bones, in an attempt to dislodge them; but it was a futile effort, for they were quick to retreat into the many holes only to emerge elsewhere.
              It was a dreadful sight. Serena’s heart went out to this poor soul, yet she knew that she was helpless to intervene. She remembered only too well satan’s warning about the penalty for interference. “I wish that I could, believe me.”<br><br>

              “The pain,” he wept, “it hurts so much. Oh please, you’ve gotta help me!”<br><br>

              “I can’t, don’t you see?” replied Serena. “Even if I tried, those demons would only throw you back.”<br><br>

              “Please,” pleaded the man, all the more insistently.<br><br>

              “Do you not see, she can’t?” objected another, in a pained male voice.
              “‘Tis no hope for us—not now, not ever.”<br><br>

              Serena recognized the distinctly Scottish accent. She turned to see a skeletal form standing in the middle of the pit across from the one where the first man knelt.<br><br>

              “Young woman, I know not what fates have conspired to bring you among us, but ‘tis a place most dire that you’ve come to,” said the Scotsman in the pit.<br><br>

              “You can see me?” asked Serena, looking into his empty eye sockets.<br><br>

              “But vaguely,” he replied, pain in his voice. He moved a couple steps toward Serena. “Even without my eyes I can perceive your form. ‘Tis with the eyes of my soul that I see thee. From the way that you appear to be dressed, I suspect that you’re not here by choice.”<br><br>

              “No,” replied Serena. “I’m like you, condemned by God, sentenced to the sea of fire by satan.”<br><br>

              The living skeleton nodded. “I’ve heard tell of this sea of fire, but I can not say, with any certainty, that I know exactly what you’re in for. Certain am I that it’s nothing pleasant. ‘Tis not but an act of cruelty that has brought satan to send you upon this sojourn, to reveal to you a small bit of his realm, before he compels you to join us in our suffering.”<br><br>

              A look of surprise swept over Serena’s face. “How do you know all of that?”<br><br>

              “It’s happened before,” he replied, yet he seemed reluctant to comment further.<br><br>

              “How long have you been here, I mean, what year?” asked Serena.<br><br>

              “After 48 years of life, I came to this place in 1703,” was the reply. “My name is Kyle McCandish; in life I was a blacksmith. But here I’m just another tormented soul beyond the realm of God’s grace.”<br><br>

              “My name is Serena, Serena Davis” “A pretty name,” noted Kyle, “a pretty name for a pretty girl. I’m sorry that it had to come to this, lass.”
              “And you’ve been here over 300 years?” gasped Serena.<br><br>

              “Sure ‘tis a long time,” noted Kyle, “but there be far more years ahead than there are behind, of that I am most certain.”<br><br>

              Eternal torment; it was a terrible prospect. Again, Serena scanned the scene around her, witnessing the crying and moaning, the helpless writhing of so many tormented souls. Then she looked to the turbulent skies. Yes, there were demons there, but not hordes of them, not compared to the multitudes of humans in the pits. Surely, there were millions of people here, if these pits extended as far as she suspected. What would happen if there were to be a general uprising? She wasn’t thinking of just a few frightened pain-crazed souls here and there making a futile break for freedom, but a rebellion of countless thousands, even millions. Could the few hundred demons circling overhead really combat such a throng? They were large and undoubtedly strong, but were they that strong? Again she gazed at the hourglass; she figured that she had two or three hours left.<br><br>

              “Kyle, have you ever tried to escape?”<br><br>

              “Only once… ‘twas a long time ago. The pain had brought me near madness. I could feel the flames from without and the worms crawling from within. I could stand no more. I looked skyward to see that none of the black devils were nearby. Perhaps I could be free of the pit for a few minutes, just a few minutes. What a fine thing it would have been, to be a whole man once more. I gathered my strength and managed to crawl from the pit, yet it took all of my strength. You see, with no muscles, no sinew, we are so very weak. I laid at the pit’s edge and as I did, I could feel my body returning to me. Oh, that it might have continued, but one of those black devils spied me from above. He threw me back into the pit, but not before ripping me arms off, and carrying them away. Many days passed before new limbs of bone grew in their stead. Those days were my worst. I was ne’r foolish enough to try to escape again.”<br><br>

              “But there’s gotta be a way out of here!” objected the man who had first pleaded with Serena. His tone was becoming increasingly agitated. “I can’t stay here forever. I can’t stay here.”<br><br>

              “He’s tried to crawl out of that pit more oft than I care to remember,” Kyle said. “Those black devils have ripped him asunder many a time, but he’ll not give up.”<br><br>

              “No, they can’t keep me here, I won’t stay here!” he cried.<br><br>

              “You can’t escape, Luis,” objected Kyle. “This is Hell, why can you not understand that?”<br><br>

              Luis turned to Serena. “And you, I heard what you said. Are you going to walk into the sea of fire just because satan tells you to? That’s insane!”<br><br>

              That comment brought back to Serena’s remembrance the reason she was on this journey. She wasn’t like Dante, being given a tour of the infernal regions that she might warn all of humanity about what lays ahead.
              She was here to stay, and when this journey was over, her torments would really begin.<br><br>

              “Answer me! Will you go quietly into the sea of fire, like a lamb to the slaughter, or will you fight?”<br><br>

              By now Serena was visibly shaking. To one degree or another, she had managed to exist in a state of denial for much of the trip. There would be a last minute reprieve, Chris would come to rescue her, or she might wake up from this dreadful nightmare. But none of that was going to happen, was it?<br><br>

              “Look at me!” demanded Luis. “Do you want to look like this? Well, do you? Do you know how much this hurts? If I was where you are, I’d do something.”<br><br>

              “‘Tis pointless, Luis,” objected Kyle, “you’ll make things worse for you and Serena.”<br><br>

              “I’d expect as much from you, Kyle!” roared Luis. “All of these years you have simply stood there and accepted all that the demons dished out to you, but not me. Those demons had one hell of a time getting me into this pit, and even more trouble keeping me in it. I didn’t go quietly, I fought them every inch of the way, and I’ll continue to fight them, continue to be a pain in their side. But you, you’re different, aren’t you? You’ve accepted it all; you’ve given satan your consent to torture you, without objection, without even so much as a whimper. You’re gutless, Kyle. You make me sick.”<br><br>

              “That will be enough,” Kyle said, turning to his heckler.<br><br>

              “No, I’m only getting started,” cried Luis. “You have no right telling Serena what she should or should not do.” Again, Luis turned to Serena.
              “Now, I’m depending on you, help me out of here and we shall change the course of history, start a revolution that will topple satan himself.”<br><br>

              “No, Serena,” warned Kyle. “Luis is in the pit of brimstone, his bones are searing hot; his very touch would be as fire. You would be horribly burned. Even if that frightens you not, you’ve no idea what the demons charged with the task of guarding us would do to you. It matters not what we say and do now, neither he nor I merit saving. We had no time for God during our lives, now He has no time for us, ‘tis just that simple.”<br><br>

              “Serena, you’ve gotta help me,” insisted Luis. “You and I together, might be able to fight them off. If we stood up to them, others would join us, I know it. You could be the catalyst. We must stand together. This is your only chance! Did you ever think that you might be here for some higher purpose? You could be the start of a rebellion that would change the very face of Hell.”<br><br>

              Luis had given a voice to the thoughts that had tormented Serena for hours. She was tempted to go along with his plan. Perhaps Luis was right.
              Satan had told her that she might have made a difference on Earth had she wanted to, if she had listened to the call of God. Could she make a difference here? She looked toward Luis, then gazed skyward. Several of the black demons had taken an interest in what was transpiring below. They wouldn’t stand a chance. A moment later, Serena backed away from Luis.<br><br>

              “No!” screamed the skeletal form. “You can’t leave! I need your help!<br><br>

              We all do!”<br><br>

              Luis threw himself at the side of his pit, crawling and scratching his way to the top, as the winged demons watched from above. Luis stumbled onto the ground beyond his pit, where he rose to his feet and moved toward Serena. Serena took yet another few steps backward as the skeleton approached.<br><br>

              Luis swung around screaming all the while. “Listen to me, brothers, sisters, all of you, it’s time to fight for our freedom! Death to the demons!
              Get out of your pits and join me now! They can’t fight us all! Our strength is our numbers.”<br><br>

              Again, Serena looked to the skies. The demons were still there, but for some reason, they took no action against this raving skeletal man. Serena gazed about at the others in the pits, surely some of their inhabitants would answer the call, but they didn’t. They continued to cry and moan, paying little attention to Luis and his ranting.<br><br>

              Again Luis turned to Serena. Serena was amazed to see a pair of eyes within the bony sockets, and there was madness within those staring globes.<br><br>

              “Cowards!” raved Luis, spinning around to address them. “All of you!
              Why don’t you do something? Fight back, this is our chance!”<br><br>

              Still the others did nothing. Perhaps they didn’t even hear him, or perhaps they were too beaten down, too frightened to respond.<br><br>

              Luis turned to Serena once more. Within his rib cage, internal organs were swiftly growing to fill the emptiness. It was a sickening sight, one worthy of the best special effects people in Hollywood. Within his mouth a tongue was growing, and upon his bones, muscle tissue. Luis clenched his fists, obviously in pain. Serena took yet another step backward.<br><br>

              “Why wouldn’t you help me, Serena?” he said, taking a step toward the young woman. “Getting out of there would have been so much easier, less painful, if you had only helped me.”<br><br>

              Serena was terrified. She felt like turning and running, yet she held her ground.<br><br>

              “Come here, young woman,” demanded Luis, beckoning with his right hand.<br><br>

              “Leave her alone!” cried Kyle.<br><br>

              “Stay out of this, Kyle,” shouted Luis, turning to face the skeletal Scotsman. “Or even better, climb out of that pit and make me. Come on, Kyle, make me. You want a piece of me? Well, here’s your chance!”<br><br>

              The Scotsman grew silent and still, his arms at his side.<br><br>

              “No, I didn’t think you would, not you.” Again, Luis turned to Serena.<br><br>

              Serena still stood motionless. It was fear, more than bravery that kept her feet planted upon the ground as if rooted.<br><br>

              “Do you know why I was sent here, Serena?”<br><br>

              Serena held her peace, not knowing how to respond to this madman.<br><br>

              “I was a bad boy,” he laughed. “My father was Juan Ramirez, the head of the most powerful drug cartel in all of Columbia. He was not one to be trifled with, and neither am I. After my father’s death, my older brother took over the family business, but he was weak. It was I who ruled our drug empire from behind the scenes. I have never been afraid to take chances or make decisions. I had my own fiancée executed for her unfaithfulness. I made certain that her death was slow and painful. No one crosses me, Serena, not anyone, not then, and not now. One day I will get a piece of satan himself for what he’s done to me, I swear it. But for right now, let us talk about you.”<br><br>

              Luis was regenerating at a fantastic rate. His skull was rapidly vanishing beneath a veneer of new flesh, and the bones of his arms and legs were already enshrouded in a layer of dark red muscle that glistened in the light of the bloated amber sun.<br><br>

              “We are not so different, you and I,” continued Luis. “I stood where you stand now, whole, without pain, 18 years ago. My rebellious and bold spirit, to say nothing of the fact that I wasn’t afraid of him, fascinated satan. He granted me half a day to see this operation of his, before I was to be thrown into this pit. You see, during my life, I had done a lot of horrible things to those I didn’t like for one reason or another, but hey, it was just business.
              Isn’t it nice when business can be mixed with pleasure? I guess the devil and I sort of dabbled in the same craft. I think satan wanted to show me that he could do me one or two better. I’ll admit that he had developed some pretty incredible ways to torture people, but hey, he had the budget for it.”<br><br>

              “Oh my God,” gasped Serena, turning suddenly pale. “You tortured people?”<br><br>

              “In my line of work, a certain degree of fear had to be maintained to keep the locals in line, to say nothing of the competition. Hey, it came with the territory. In my special chamber, beneath the family estate I loosened up plenty of purse strings, silenced many a tongue, and saved the family business a lot of money and trouble in the process. I made a lot of people vanish. That sort of thing happens in Columbia. You gotta do what you gotta do, and if you enjoy it, well, all the better. I won’t go into all the details about my methods, but they were unique. A lot of terrible things happen in the mountains of Columbia.”<br><br>

              Serena was horrified. She couldn’t imagine how anyone could find pleasure in physically harming another. “But now, you’re the one on the receiving end of the torture,” she noted. “Hasn’t that made you understand how your victims felt? Hasn’t it caused you even a little bit of remorse about what you did to them?”<br><br>

              “No, not really.”<br><br>

              “Are you telling me that you like what happens to you in that pit?”<br><br>

              asked Serena.<br><br>

              “No, that’s crazy, you must be as stupid as you look,” Luis said. “I prefer to give rather than to receive. As I already told you, when it came my time to enter that fiery pit, I fought tooth and nail. I didn’t go quietly. So, I ask you again, will you?”<br><br>

              Luis glanced at a vacant pit to Serena’s right. “Yes, that will do nicely.
              Perhaps the time has come for you to realize the nature of my suffering, Serena.” Luis pointed toward the glowing pit. Just kick off your sandals and jump in.”<br><br>

              Serena’s eyes grew wide with terror. She looked into the pit. She saw the luminous red rocks, the shimmering waves of heat, it was unimaginable.<br><br>

              “What? You can’t be serious!”<br><br>

              “Don’t question me, woman, do it!” demanded Luis. “I want to watch you squirm, see the flesh burn from your bones, and it won’t take long, seniorita. It won’t take long.”<br><br>

              “No,” gasped Serena, taking a step backward.<br><br>

              “Why, what’s wrong, Serena? You were going to jump into the sea of fire for satan, why not jump into this pit for me? Look, let me make this simple for you. You can jump in yourself or I can throw you in, it’s your choice.”<br><br>

              “Luis, please, leave her in peace!” pleaded Kyle.<br><br>

              Luis took no notice of the Scotsman’s plea. He was no threat.<br><br>

              Luis kept advancing toward Serena. By now, his ribs had been completely closed in by muscle and sinew, and skin had nearly covered the muscles of his face. Even the first signs of hair were appearing upon his scalp. “I want you to know what it’s like to be down there in the pit as I was, nothing but scalding hot bones infested with worms that can’t die, and in such terrible pain. I want you to be looking up at someone whose body is whole and beautiful. Then I want you to beg, to plead for mercy. Don’t worry, I might pull you out, after a while, if you beg pitifully enough and long enough. Don’t you see? You’re mine. Now, do it, get in!”<br><br>

              Luis lunged toward Serena, yet he never reached her. He was caught in midair by three huge demons. They swept around him like a terrible dark cloud. Serena could hear the dreadful screams, the curses, the sounds of ripping flesh. That was the last she ever saw or heard of Luis.<br><br>

              Serena was on the run, running as fast as she could. More than once she narrowly missed tumbling into one of the hellish pits. A state akin to madness had descended upon her, and now it would not lift. The world around her had become unreal, distant, little more than a nightmare.
              Perhaps stumbling into one of the broiling pits would accomplish nothing more than shocking her back into the world of consciousness. She might find herself in her own bed, Chris at her side.<br><br>

              Perhaps her dream had begun earlier than that. She might awaken as a child of ten, her whole life having found its genesis in the raging fever that had nearly killed her that spring. And still she continued her headlong flight. Her lungs and legs ached, yet she didn’t break stride. She didn’t have to stop or even slacken her pace. There was no such thing as pure exhaustion here, how could there be? Exhaustion was for mortals, she was an immortal, a being of eternity, so she ran.<br><br>

              Time had become a blur. Her pain was continual, she just had to stop, but she didn’t. Surely there was a limit to her endurance, but it never came.
              It hung out there in the imminent future, yet, like a desert mirage, like the end of the rainbow, she never reached it.<br><br>

              In the end, it was her own haste that brought an end to her flight. The half-buried, football-sized rock caught her left foot, and in a fraction of a second, she was airborne in a headlong plunge. She felt the harsh radiant heat, saw the glowing rocks of the pit before her, then beneath her. Her head was awash in adrenaline, she plunged downward. Her toes caught the far edge of the pit as she landed flat on her face. She pushed herself up, spun around to see the pit that she had virtually leapt over. She hadn’t leapt over it at its widest point, but it was still quite a jump. She had caught the full attention of the skeleton who sat at its center. He gazed at the rag-clad human who had flown over the crematorium that was his eternal home.<br><br>

              “Chi sei? Dove stai andando?” he asked, in a trembling voice that spoke of his pain and anguish.<br><br>

              “I’m sorry,” said Serena regaining control of herself. “Really I am.”<br><br>

              He rose to his feet, facing the only stranger who had wandered into his eternity in a very long time. He stared at her, or at least she figured that was what he was doing. He seemed so pitiful. Serena rose once more to her feet, extended her apologies, for all they were worth, and continued on, this time more carefully.<br><br>

              For a moment, the stranger remained completely motionless, standing like some hanging skeleton in a biology lab. Then he sat down within the pit once more, with only his pain to keep him company.<br><br>

              Serena had regained control. She couldn’t allow herself to lose it like that, not again. She looked back, trying to figure out just how far her headlong frenzy had carried her. She was surprised to discover how much more distant the mountains appeared now than before. She pulled out the small hourglass. It was difficult to tell just how many minutes had passed based on this strange chronometer, but it couldn’t have been more than half an hour, probably less. Then there was the issue of the pit. She had jumped completely over it. How fast had she been running? She was still winded, but quickly recovering. A Scripture verse came to mind, probably remembered because it was also part of a song sung at her husband’s church.<br><br>

              “You will walk and not be weary, you shall run and not faint,” she said, quoting it as best she could. That was a description of the glorified body of a saint in Heaven.<br><br>

              No, this wasn’t Heaven. In Heaven she would not have been winded at all, but apparently, this new body that healed so very rapidly also had other abilities. The fact that she had sailed over the pit said that she must have been running very fast. Yes, her muscles hurt, there was a limit to her strength, but her endurance; well, that might be another matter. This body she now had was God’s final gift to her before He cast her into outer darkness. Satan depended on this gift. In order for the souls in Hell to suffer, they had to have endurance, didn’t they?<br><br>

              Serena continued on, wondering if there truly was an end to the pits;
              there was. Not ten minutes had passed when she left the last of them behind and stepped out into a vast plain with few rocks. Only cracked, sun-baked soil stretched before her. No, there was something else. It was almost on the horizon, nearly lost in the haze, a glowing sea of red—the sea of fire?<br><br>

              Her journey was almost at an end.<br><br>

                        </p>


    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    <!-- <p class="chapterTitle">The Vision</p> -->


          <p>
            SERENA continued on, following her long shadow much as the proverbial mule might follow the carrot hanging by a stick in front of him. Yet in this case, the end was now in sight. It was no longer a mirage retreating eternally before her. It was difficult to say how long it would be before she reached the infernal shore, but she suspected that she would arrive there well before the appointed time. Perhaps she should slow her pace. There was no hurry. Perhaps it was best to arrive just in time, rather than to wait around for her time to be up.
            After all, this wasn’t a flight at the airport she was rushing to catch. She wouldn’t be expected to check in at the gate two hours before departure.
            She wouldn’t have to go through security or wait in line to check her baggage. She didn’t even have any carry-on. Nope, she could step right to the head of the line. Serena shook her head in disbelief, why in the world did that crazy analogy pop into her head?
            Serena continued to scan the hazy horizon before her. Here and there she could make out flashes of light. It had the appearance of a distant thunderstorm. Did it actually rain in Hell?
            She thought back to her days as a child, watching the summer thunderstorms roll over the Cascade mountains. How she had loved the thunder and the lightning, the ever-changing shape of the white towering clouds against the deep blue sky. It was a thing of power, of wonder. Back then, she had pondered over the wonders of creation. She thought about the Creator of the thunderstorm and the lightning, of the One who ordained the coming of the rain; that brought such a wonderful fragrance of freshness to the meadows.
            Then there was the rainbow. Her grandmother had said that it was God’s covenant with man, the promise that He would never again destroy the world with a terrible flood, as He had done in the days of Noah. She thought of her grandmother. It was she who had spoken about the wonderful God who had made all of creation. She had often looked after the young Serena when her mother and step-father were at work. She had read Bible stories to Serena, spoken of God’s love. She had so wanted Serena to believe, yet she had died. She was only 61 when the Lord took her away.
            Through her prolonged illness, she had spoken of going to be with Jesus in Heaven. Serena had no doubt at all that she was there with Him, looking down on the world. But, she wouldn’t remember Serena any longer, would she? Her memories of Serena, and the love that accompanied them, would be swept from her mind, so that she might not mourn for her. Still, Serena remembered her Grandma Sylvia, and as long as she did, their love would not truly die.
            Serena’s mind snapped back to the here and now. In this place there was no room for love, caring, mercy, or compassion. There was only fear, hate, pain, and remorse. One’s only encounters here were with those most dismal emotions. And the hate? Most of that was furnished by encounters with satan and his minions, and it spread out from there. She hoped that she would have no more other worldly encounters between here and the sea of fire. She had seen enough suffering, encountered enough crazed souls for one day. Yet she expected that she would not be so fortunate.
            Nonetheless, there didn’t seem to be anything going on out here, no circling demons, no flaming pits or thundering geysers, no odor of death, just a vast flat expanse of loneliness. Even the traveling was easier here.
            Now that the sound of the wailing souls in the pits behind her had faded into the background of nothingness, it had become very quiet. Only the slightest breeze stirred the hot dry air, an acrid breeze that swept in from the great sea before her. Serena watched her shadow pass across the parched ground that knew neither a green plant nor a drop of rain, as she followed it to disaster.
            She was becoming so hot, so thirsty. It had been many hours since she’d had a drink of water or rested her legs. She doubted that she would have the opportunity to do either anytime soon. Indeed, she might never have that opportunity again.
            The trek continued without incident and without any remarkable discoveries. The red sea was growing closer, and the distant lightning was becoming brighter and more distinct, as the haze above the plains slowly cleared. Yet, something else, something odd did attract her attention. Here and there, small sections of the land had been disturbed, for the flat radiating pattern of cracks that dominated this region was interrupted by a small mound of smooth earth, hardly more than a few inches high. It might well have been a natural phenomenon, but Serena doubted it.
            It was many minutes before Serena stopped. She was certain that she had heard a sound coming from parts unknown. At first, she thought it might be the cacophony of wailing souls in the pits, echoing off the distant mountains behind her, yet she quickly dismissed that possibility. No, this sound was coming from close at hand, muffled and faint, yet very nearby.
            She looked about her, then at the ground beneath her feet. Could it possibly be coming from somewhere below? A chill swept through her soul. It was not a single voice she was hearing, but many; and they were in anguish. She dreaded to even consider the nature of the distress. She moved on, hoping that the muffled cries would fade, but they didn’t. The voices were different from moment to moment, yet they were still there. She recalled the disturbed plots of earth. Had satan buried people alive beneath her feet? She dropped to one knee, listening carefully. The voices were there; and they were coming from the ground. They were too muffled for her to make out individual words.
            “Oh God,” she gasped. “Oh Lord; how can you let something like this go on?”
            There was nothing more to say. Serena figured that God wasn’t listening, not to people here, anyway. Why should He? They were lost forever, beyond redemption, as she was. She rose to her feet and moved on.
            The mournful cries that arose from the ground below drove Serena to despair, as the great sea before her grew closer. Above it, along the horizon, she witnessed towering clouds, not unlike those of the Oregon summer, rising above the glowing sea. Reflecting the light of the low sun and crimson sea, the turbulent clouds held an amber hue, highlighted by bright threads of electricity that arced around and between them. Slowly, a great vista of infernal grandeur was unveiled, stretching across the horizon.
            Before her the ground seemed to drop off precipitously, even as a low roar gradually masked the cries from below. Within minutes, she stood at the precipice of a great cliff, rising 30 or 40 feet above the turbulent fiery mass below.
            What lay before her was a vista like none she had ever seen before. No, this was not a lake, but a great sea, with mighty waves pounding at the base of the cliff, as if seeking to drive it back to the mountains. In the back of her mind, she had envisioned the sea of fire to be an enormous sea of red hot lava. Nowhere in the Bible was such a thing inferred, but somehow, that was the picture that was ingrained within the depths of Serena’s mind. Her lofty vista from the mountain top had only strengthened this view. Yet, now that she was here, at close range, she realized its true essence.
            Its surface was black and shiny, and its nature slimy and viscous, like crude oil. Much of it burned with a terrible intensity that Serena could feel even from the top of the cliff. Here and there great fountains of super hot liquid erupted from the depths, scattering their scalding essence into the black sea of ooze. In other places, pillars of fire burst forth, rising high into the sky. The evil black mass swirled with incredible fury, as if being churned from below by unseen forces. Amidst it all was the dreadful roar, the pounding of waves against the nearly vertical cliff, the bubbling, the swirling, and erupting. In her most terrible nightmares, Serena had never imagined that it would be like this—was she to be cast into this vast cauldron?
            “Oh God, no!” she whimpered. “No!”
            She was trembling as she picked up the mystical hourglass. So little time left. Of all the things she had seen here, this was the most horrifying.
            What had she done to deserve such a terrible fate?
            “Glorious, is it not?”
            Serena turned to behold the prince of darkness himself. Upon his face was a broad smile. How long had he been standing there? She couldn’t say.
            “My crowning achievement,” he said, stretching his hand toward the horizon, “a great sea of turbulent thundering fury that extends farther than you can possibly imagine. It extends far into the darkness beyond the horizon. It is the black heart of Hell itself, and it will be your new home. I wanted to be here to bid you farewell before you took the plunge to meet its hot, wet embrace.” Satan turned to the lifeless plains behind him. “Still, we have some time before you must begin your eternal service to me. Yes, time to see another example of my creative genius.”
            Serena had seen enough. “Please, no more,” she begged.
            Satan cocked his head in feigned surprise. “This couldn’t be the inquisitive Serena, who knelt in my chambers less than twelve hours ago.
            Where is the young woman who was so bold as to instruct me on the finer points of governing my dark empire? I thought you wanted knowledge.”
            “I can’t bear to see any more,” she whimpered, her honor and dignity long forgotten.
            “But see it, you shall,” retorted satan. “It is my will.” He extended his hand to Serena. “Now, come.”
            With little choice, Serena placed her hand in his and walked with him away from the edge of the cliff. Almost immediately she noticed a dark figure standing in the distance. He seemed to be leaning over a pit dug into the dry soil of the plain. He must have been standing there all along, yet, in her agitated state, she hadn’t noticed him until now.
            “I couldn’t have you missing this,” continued satan. “I’ve arranging this little drama for your benefit. I wanted you to witness yet another example of how I deal with your kind.”
            “Why me?” asked Serena, her voice stressed. “Why do you have to show all of this to me?”
            “I’ve already answered that question once,” replied satan glancing toward Serena. “Really, little one, you need to listen more carefully. I told you that you were special to God. I know His plans, and I have worked tirelessly to thwart them. This time I succeeded. If you had taken a different path, if you had followed Him rather than me, you would have deprived me of more guests than you can imagine. You would have caused me much trouble. But now, little one, you are here, and I shall take good care of you.
            I shall put you where you can do me no harm.”
            As the thunder of the great sea faded, she could again hear the mournful voices rising from below and they added to her sense of despair.
            “When I confer once again with the most holy God, you may be sure that the topic of Serena Farnsworth shall be brought up, if only briefly. You are but another sentence in my story of success. You shall be but one more example of the failings of the Creator’s grand design, and this pathetic little creature called man. I will spare Him no details of your eternal torment. I want Him to realize just how pointless His love for your kind really is.
            When the final tally is taken, and the game over, I am confident that I shall possess far more souls than the most high God.”
            “You talk as if it were a game,” retorted Serena, who no longer cared if she offended the prince of darkness.
            “Oh, it is,” assured satan. “And I do enjoy it so. Formulating punishments that befit the nature of the many crimes of mankind constantly challenges my creativity. Behold a case in point.”
            Satan stretched his hand forward, toward a mound of dirt and an elongated hole excavated into the dry ground of the plain. A demon dressed wholly in black stood over the pit, while an occasional spray of brown dirt issued from the hole before him.
            “Be quick, or it will be all the worse for you!” He demanded, gazing downward toward some unseen individual.
            It was then that Serena noticed the plain black coffin setting by the rim of the pit. It was of the oblong variety, a bit wider toward its middle than at its ends, the sort of coffin that might have been used several centuries ago.
            Its lid sat to one side, allowing Serena to view the inside of the box. Much to her horror, she discovered that it was lined on both its bottom and sides with a multitude of sharp nails, each over an inch long. Even the inside surface of the lid was lined with sharp barbs. The demon came to attention at the approach of the master.
            “Is all in readiness?” asked satan, looking briefly at the project before him.
            “Yes, my Lord,” confirmed the demon. “You have arrived at a most opportune time; we have just finished with the dull preliminaries. We are prepared for the real drama to begin.”
            Now Serena could see into the pit. It was five or six feet deep, and at the bottom, a man clothed only in a gray loincloth labored tirelessly. He moved handful after handful of earth, his only tool; his bloody fingernails. He seemed totally exhausted.
            “Now, get out of there!” demanded the demon. “Be quick!”
            The thin, barefoot man scrambled from the roughly hewn pit. He appeared to be about 30 years of age and was both filthy and sweaty from his prolonged labors. There were telltale welts upon his back where the demon had apparently applied a lash to his hide as motivation.
            The demon pointed toward the grizzly spiked box. “Now, get into your coffin, the master is waiting.”
            “Please!” pleaded the man, falling to his knees. “Please, no!”
            The demon’s wrinkled face scowled. “Believe me; it will be far better for you if you get in of your own volition.”
            Weeping, the man rose to his feet and walked to the edge of the coffin.
            He hesitated as if searching for some means by which he could enter in with a minimum of pain. How could one willingly step into a box filled with hundreds of sharp nails? Finally, sensing that the demon was about to lose patience with him, the terrified man sat upon the rim of the coffin. He tried to lie on his side, balancing himself on the rim, before attempting to ease himself into the menacing box. His efforts were for naught. He lost his balance and fell in, impaling himself on a hundred or more sharp nails. He howled as blood oozed from his back and down the nails. He tried to rise, but found he lacked both the strength and the conviction.
            The demon reached for a large sealed jar by the side of the coffin and opened its wide lid. Serena was horrified as all manners of crawling insects poured from the earthen container and into the coffin. Some appeared to be large beetles, while others were more akin to cockroaches. Still others looked like giant fleas and ticks. They all lit ravenously into the defenseless man in the coffin, even as the demon swiftly closed the lid, sealing the hoard of insects and their human host within.
            Serena endeavored to turn from the horrible tragedy being played out before her, but satan held her tightly by the arms, compelling her to watch.
            An instant later, the demon raised his arms, and the coffin was levitated from the ground and then lowered into the hole that its occupant had excavated. The dirt tumbled in behind it, as if cast down by a hundred invisible spades, covering up the coffin in a matter of seconds. In less than a minute, all that remained was a small mound of slightly darker soil and the muffled screams that emanated from the depths.
            “Thus is the penalty of sin,” announced satan, raising his hands. “Pity him not, little one. Do you think I have condemned an innocent man? I have not. He was an assassin, a killer for hire. Many were his victims, killed at the whim of his villainous employer. Men, women, even children; he killed without regard. Most of his victims never saw him coming, for he traveled in the shadows and attacked without warning. In darkness he lived, and in darkness shall he dwell for eternity, attacked by a voracious hoard he can not even see, never to know a moment without terror. So I have decreed, so it shall be.”
            Serena was horrified beyond words, this dreadful soul’s crimes not withstanding. She could hardly imagine the torment of those countless souls buried in this cemetery beyond the grave. The nails, the darkness, the suffocation, the horrible insects; it was absolutely ghastly.
            “Ah, but I’ve saved the best for last,” promised satan. “I have planned a sort of family reunion. Yes, that is exactly what it is.”
            “A family reunion?” asked Serena.
            “Yes,” confirmed satan. “But I do not wish to spoil the surprise.”
            With the wave of his hand, the prince of darkness, caused a dark portal, the sort that Serena had become only too familiar with, to appear before him. He compelled Serena to gaze into its depths.
            It was difficult to see beyond the threshold, for the rocky corridor was misty and dimly lit, perhaps subterranean. More than ever before, Serena dreaded to enter. Something horrible awaited her in that tunnel. She had seen enough. She tried to pull away from the prince of darkness, though it was a vain attempt.
            Satan had little patience with this human wench. Yes, she amused him, but his schedule was indeed full this day, and there were so many other matters to see to. He grasped her arm firmly and dragged her into the ethereal gateway.
            The first thing that hit Serena was the claustrophobic, hot atmosphere of this realm, an atmosphere that bore a trace of the stench of sulfur, combined with that of burning flesh and hair. Serena could hear the distant muffled roar of flames, like that of a mighty blast furnace. Yet the roar did not come from any specific direction, but from all around her.
            The brown, rust-stained walls of the narrow corridor in which she stood extended into the dusty mists in both directions. The mists prevented her from accessing the true size of this place, though she suspected that it was huge.
            The roughly hewn walls were lined with a multitude of heavy metal doors, spaced at regular intervals. To the left of each door, a trio of metal wheels, one large and two small, were mounted to the wall, obviously some sort of controls, for as yet unseen machinery. Each door was identical, sealed tightly to its metal frame, and held together by a multitude of large metal rivets. Each door had a small circular glass peephole at about eye level. A fiery orange glow radiated from most of these small portals, illuminating the otherwise dark corridor in stark flickering illumination.
            They attested to the presence of a roaring inferno, just inches beyond the metal door. It reminded Serena of a scene from an old horror movie, though she really didn’t remember which one.
            Serena had always felt uneasy in dark, close quarters. For her, this phobia only compounded the ghastly atmosphere of this place.
            Satan allowed Serena a moment to breathe in the gloomy despair that dominated this place before speaking. “Behold, we are over a mile below the torrid sun-baked surface of this world, in a prison with no physical entrance and no route of escape. Above us, the eternal midday sun bakes the landscape at over 250 degrees. It would boil water, if there was water. But let us focus on this dark realm. It was devised by a group of my most skilled and inventive minions, over a century ago, in an attempt to make my kingdom more modern and relevant to the people of the time; a renovation of sorts. I suppose to you, its architecture must seem somewhat dated.
            Nonetheless, it remains quite an effective means of delivering fear and agony to our human clients.”
            “What happens here?” asked Serena, who regretted posing the question almost before she had finished saying it.
            “I never thought you would ask,” replied satan, an evil gleam in his eye.
            “Behind each of these heavy metal doors, fed by an ingenious network of pipes, vents, and shafts, are a series of indeed marvelous furnaces, furnaces fueled by hot volcanic gases escaping from the dark heart of this world. It is, indeed, a beautiful thing to behold.”
            The prince of darkness walked to one of the dark metal doors, pulling Serena with him. It was only then when she noticed the plaque riveted to the door, just below the small glassy port. It bore only a name embossed in bold letters: Karl Rienstadt.
            Satan motioned to the small viewing port. “Go ahead, take a look. Tell me what it is that you see.”
            Serena hesitantly moved toward the peephole and gazed into the room beyond. It was very bright, making it difficult to discern what lay beyond the door. Slowly Serena’s eyes adjusted to the brilliance. She saw a small room, perhaps six or seven feet square, the size of a walk-in closet. It appeared to be composed entirely of riveted metal, of that much Serena was fairly certain. The walls of the furnace seemed to undulate in the intense heat, even as brilliant flames of bright yellow, orange, and blue fire swirled wildly through a large grate on the floor, sweeping through the tiny room like a small but powerful cyclone. They vanished again through a similar grate in the ceiling, spiraling rapidly upward to who knew where. Never had she seen flames that looked or behaved like these, it was unnatural.
            Indeed, it had a beauty all its own.
            Then Serena discerned a movement within the terrible furnace, something at the rear of the chamber, almost lost amidst the swirling flames. Her perfect, immortal eyes focused upon it, and it became clear. It was the form of a man, shackled hand and foot to the back wall, writhing in agony, clothed in a bright shimmering garb of kaleidoscopic fire.
            Unlike the damned souls in the fire pits of the plains, his body had not been reduced to a mere skeletal form, but appeared to have retained most of its muscle and sinew. That muscle was encased in a blackened layer of charred bubbling flesh that fought an eternal battle against the fires that sought to consume it. Of all the sights Serena had seen in Hell, this one was the most ghastly. Serena turned away in horror.
            “I call it a furnace cell,” announced satan, a sense of prideful accomplishment in his voice. “It leaves its human victim’s body and his nervous system largely intact, allowing him, or her, to better appreciate the essence of the flames. Imagine it, little one, being clothed in a luminous colorful garment of fire for all eternity. This wretched soul made his home on Earth a living hell for his wife and children. He imagined himself to be the center of his world. Therefore, in his afterlife, I have again made him the center of his own world, small as that world might be. I have placed him in his own private crematorium, shackled him in position, at the very center of the swirling fire. Here, he shall dwell alone forever, to feel and consider the consequences of his vile deeds.”
            Serena was speechless. Did the dark heart of this enemy of humanity know no limits in its depths of depravity?
            “But I did not bring you here to meet Mr. Rienstadt. No, this is to be a family reunion. Come.”
            Satan continued down the shadowy corridor with Serena in tow, until they came to another metal doorway. Little light emanated from the small viewing port of this door, the room beyond was quiet and only dimly lit.
            The prince of darkness directed Serena’s attention to the plaque on the door.
            It was hard to read amidst the gloom of the corridor; Serena drew closer. A surge of adrenaline swept through her whole being as she read the name engraved upon the plaque—Bedillia Farnsworth, her mother.
            “No,” she cried, collapsing to her knees.
            “Why, I’m surprised,” said Satan. “I thought you’d be happy to learn how I have dealt with your evil, abusive mother during these past eight years. You should be thanking me. I have avenged her cruelty to you many times over, and I have only begun.”
            Satan proceeded to the large wheel mounted upon the wall and began to turn it. Amidst the sound of a dozen clacking gears and squeaking metal rollers, the ponderous door slid slowly to the side, along its metal track. It had the sound of a mechanism that was seldom used.
            The next thing Serena knew, she was being pulled roughly to her feet and escorted into the small chamber. The room still bore the awful odor of burned hair, as well as the odor of cooking meat. The horrible inferences of these sensations made Serena’s mind whirl. The only light within the room was an orange glow that came from beyond the metal grates in the ceiling and floor.
            Peering through the grate below her, Serena beheld the swirling kaleidoscopic flames, roaring through some sort of enormous glowing conduit, held back from the chamber by a force she didn’t understand.
            Maybe it was some sort of clear barrier; perhaps something more exotic.
            Nonetheless, it was a fearful sight. Serena felt very uneasy standing in the midst of this terrible crematorium.
            There was a smile of satisfaction on satan’s face as he stretched out his hand toward the small room’s lone quivering occupant. “Normally the flames would be roaring through this chamber, as they have for the past eight years, but I had commanded that the vents be closed about half an hour ago, to give Bedillia a little bit of time to compose herself. Not too much time, mind you. I did not wish to grant her an overly long respite from her agony. That action might be regarded as an act of mercy, and I didn’t want to project that sort of image. I’m sure you understand.”
            Yes, Serena understood, though she said nothing. There were tears flowing from her eyes, as she gazed into the face of her mother, for the first time in over eight years. Her mother’s arms were shackled together high over her head, and her bare feet were secured in some sort of gray metal stirrups that were riveted to the large metal grate on the floor. She was clothed in rags, even more inadequate than those Serena wore. She was covered in ash and soot from head to toe. Still, she looked younger than Serena had remembered her. She had the countenance of the Bedillia Farnsworth of Serena’s early childhood, though she seemed far more worn and sad.
            “I’m so cold,” said Bedillia, in a quivering tone. She didn’t seem to comprehend what was going on around her.
            “Mommy?” said Serena, in a soft voice, barely above a whisper.
            Bedillia looked up with dazed eyes at her daughter. At first she didn’t seem to recognize her. Then her eyes widened. “Serena?”
            “Yes, it’s me, Mommy,” replied Serena, the tears flowing from her eyes.
            “Yes, Bedillia,” announced satan, his smile growing, “it is true, your daughter is indeed here. It pleases me greatly to orchestrate this impromptu family reunion. But it is you, Bedillia, who is the author of it. It is your failure as a mother that has brought this little one to us. Your years of training, of abuse, have served my purposes well. They hardened her heart and dimmed her vision. Now both mother and daughter belong to me. My victory is complete.”
            “Oh, God, no!” wept Bedillia. “It’s my fault that you’re here. I belong here, but not you. Oh God, Serena, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. Please, forgive me.”
            There was not a moment’s hesitation. Any malice that had dwelled within Serena’s heart these many years seemed to evaporate in the heat.
            Serena caressed her mother’s cheek with her hand, then wrapped her arms around her. “Please don’t cry. I love you, Mommy. I forgive you. I want you to know that. I still love you.”
            Bedillia could hardly speak; she was so full of emotion. “I love you too, Serena, more than I can say.”
            The devil stared at the two; he seemed stunned. Clearly, this wasn’t what he had planned at all. “You don’t understand,” interrupted the devil, growing anger in his voice. “It is Bedillia’s fault that you are here.
            Bedillia’s abuse hardened your heart, started you on the road to my domain.
            How can you forgive her for that? I brought you here so you might enjoy some measure of revenge before your own suffering begins. Do what you wish to her, you have my permission. I will provide you with whatever you need to accomplish that end. What is your pleasure, Serena? This opportunity will not present itself again. Indulge yourself.”
            “No,” retorted Serena. “My mother didn’t do this to me, I did. I rejected Christ’s love. I had my chance, and I rejected Him; I admit I did.” There was a moment of hesitation. “If I could blame anyone, it would be you.”
            Serena expected satan to react with rage to her comment. She was not disappointed.
            “Your flattery will gain you nothing here,” he roared. “And I assure you, the fate I have planned for you is no better than that of your mother. You too will feel the touch of the fires soon enough.”
            With those words, satan pulled Serena from her mother, throwing her to the floor.
            “Leave her alone!” cried Bedillia. There was unexpected anger, and even defiance in her voice. Satan grabbed Bedillia by the neck, turning her toward him. She gasped, barely able to breathe.
            “Know this, Bedillia Farnsworth, I will take your daughter to the great sea of fire, there to swim forever, engulfed in its scalding blackness, caressed by its flames. And as for you, wench, you will remain here, clothed in your garb of fire, for all eternity. Only know that your daughter’s suffering will be worse. And I will see to it that you have a front row seat at the festivities, her baptism in the sea of fire.” Satan’s grip grew tighter.
            Bedillia’s wide, terrified eyes bulged.
            “Stop it!” screamed Serena, who had risen to her feet again. With little concern for the consequences of her actions, she plowed into the prince of darkness from behind. She struck him hard, wrapping her arms around his legs.
            Much to Serena’s surprise, he released his grip from her mother’s neck, and stumbled to the left several steps, before regaining his balance. He swung violently about, pulling Serena upward by her throat. She tried to hang on, but he easily dislodged her.
            “How dare you touch me!” he screamed in a deafening roar. He lifted Serena into the air with one hand, then tossed her violently to the far wall of Bedillia’s cell. She hit hard and slumped down to the ground. Satan moved forward then stopped. “No, I want you in one piece, conscious and fully alert; all the better to feel the hot caress of the sea of fire. I want no other pain to interfere with the experience.”
            Satan roughly picked Serena up from the floor, as a portal of light appeared before him. Through the portal they, and Bedillia, could see the cliffs that towered above the sea of fire.
            “I love you, Serena!” Bedillia cried, even as satan pulled her daughter through the portal. Satan would see to it that the portal would remain open until Serena’s sentence was fulfilled.
            “Now,” continued satan, standing a few feet in front of the terrible cliff overlooking the sea of fire, “let us turn our attention to you. You’ve had twelve hours to watch all manners of horrors happening to others, but now it’s your turn, little one.” Satan grasped Serena’s wrist and gave it a slight twist. “You have an appointment to keep, and I don’t want you to be late.
            I’ve even granted your mother the privilege of watching.”
            A tear trickled down Serena’s cheek. If only it were simply death she was facing. How mercifully quick it would be. But it wasn’t just death, was it? It was something far worse. What would it be like? What did she have to look forward to? Did she really want to know? “What will the sea of fire do to me?”
            Satan laughed. “Why Serena, I don’t want to spoil the surprise. You shall know soon enough. In time, the eddies and currents of this great turbulent sea will carry you to distant and fascinating places, into a realm of darkness, though I doubt that you will be in a mood to truly appreciate the grand journey.”
            Before her, Serena saw a narrow and treacherous peninsula of land, a ridge that jutted out about 30 feet from the sheer cliff. At its end, an almost surreal precipice overlooked a particularly turbulent stretch of the flaming frothing sea.
            “Behold, your gateway to a new and terrible existence,” announced satan. “From there, you shall throw yourself into the maelstrom. It shall be the beginning of an eternal struggle, the likes of which you cannot now imagine.”
            Serena struggled for control. The terrible moment had at last arrived.
            Now she would join the tormented souls she had encountered in their agony, no longer an observer, but a victim. Her mind was awash in emotion.
            She turned to see satan watching her intently, and a few feet away was the portal. Beyond it she could faintly see her mother. No, she had to be strong for her.
            Satan waited. Surely this wench would break down, faced with the unimaginable fate before her. He waited, but nothing happened. Yes, she was quivering, but she didn’t cry openly. He could wait no longer.
            “Enough—the time for talk is at an end. Remove the sandals from your feet, for you shall have no further need of them where you are going. For you shall never again feel the solid ground beneath your feet. The moment has come for you to immerse yourself in your element. You shall walk to the threshold from whence you shall cast yourself into a sea of pure undiluted pain. Obey me, wench, I warn you, I will not ask twice.”
            Serena undid her sandals and rose onto trembling legs. Slowly, she walked out onto the narrow ridge. To either side of the treacherous pathway, she saw the burning swirling sea, a Dantesque parody of the pounding waves along the rocky coastline of Oregon. She tried to focus on the stony ground directly before her feet, yet all too soon it ended, to be replaced by empty sulfurous air. The precipice that loomed ahead gave her a frightening vista of the nightmarish sea directly below. It was a straight plunge down to the heaving turbulent inferno.
            “Do you have any last words before the sea of fire engulfs you in an agony beyond your comprehension?” asked satan with a sense of satisfaction in his tone.
            Serena looked back to see him waiting patiently at the edge of the cliff, watching her intently. His arms were folded across his chest, his eyes icy cold, filled with hate for humanity.
            Serena said not a word to satan, but turned to the dark portal beyond.
            She couldn’t see her mother anymore, but she felt certain that she was watching. “I love you,” she whispered, hoping that her mother could see and understand. There was nothing more to say.
            “Now, just lean forward and allow yourself to fall,” said satan. “It is just that simple. Be quick, I have other more important tasks to attend to.”
            Serena turned once more to the burning shifting maelstrom below her.
            She could feel the intense heat. Even from here it burned. There were no other options, and no escape. She took a last deep breath and let go. There was an instant of weightlessness, of dizzying instability, as ground and feet parted company. At first she was falling headfirst toward the seething inferno. Her whole universe was encompassed by the swirling sea of fire.
            She felt the growing heat, saw the broiling mass hurtling toward her. She managed to swing around, to right herself, for whatever good that might do.
            She closed her eyes tightly. Then came the impact, the penetration. It was hot beyond comprehension, encompassing her entire body, as she plunged into the hot blackness, vanishing beneath its heaving surface.
            Nothing could have prepared her for the intensity of the pain and terror of this ghastly experience. Despite her best efforts, the terrible black fluid penetrated into her body, through her nose, her ears, and between her lips.
            No part of her body was unaffected by the broiling touch of the black sea. It fried her tongue, and her eyes felt as if they would explode.
            She tried to fight her way back to the surface, flailing her arms wildly through the thick, swirling inferno. She couldn’t even be sure if she was moving in the right direction, yet she eventually burst to the surface. She howled in pain, as a mouthful of the black oil mixed with boiling saliva and blood erupted from her lips.
            She opened her eyes, only to see a wall of pitted black rock looming directly ahead. The current nearly threw her into the cliff before sweeping her away once more. Again she was swept toward the rocks. Again she was drawn away. She vanished below the surface of the black sea once more, pulled downward by the powerful undertow. She kicked and flailed wildly before emerging again. An instant later, she was bounced mercilessly off the cliff. She was pulled back once more stunned and bruised.
            Nothing in her experience could have prepared her for this. It was a pain beyond pain, an engulfing agony for which there were no words, for life could not offer its equal. She was tossed and swirled around again and again by the violence of a sea like none other, and through it all, she screamed as she had never screamed before.
            For an instant, through the rippling waves of heat, she saw satan, standing at the threshold of the cliff; then he was gone. Serena fought against the pain and formulated a desperate plan. The cliff. If the waves threw her against it again, she just might be able to get a handhold. Yes, it was almost vertical, but its rugged, pocked surface was filled with small crevices and holes, potential handholds if she could just reach them.
            Yet the current was sweeping her away into the open sea. She tried to swim, but the black slime was hot and unyielding. Her plan faded into a screaming realm of pain, which swiftly became the center of her world.
            Her beautiful long hair burst into flames, burning to blackened stubble.
            She struggled desperately, to what ends she knew not. For a few seconds, her right arm emerged from the undulating sea—a steaming mass of scalded flesh oozed with bubbling dark blood.
            “Oh God!” she cried, thrashing about, pushing upon the dark surface of the seething sea, trying to prevent herself from vanishing beneath the swirling mass. It took all of her effort to prevent it from swallowing her.
            The flesh above the dreadful touch of the searing sea was caressed by the flames, lending to it a different yet no less terrible pain than that below. Her face was soon covered with ugly red splotches. She could feel the intense heat penetrating her body, the pain plunging ever deeper. A growing cloud of steam and smoke erupted from the boiling black mass surrounding her, as her blood boiled and vaporized. Were she not immortal, Serena was certain that she would already have been dead.
            Within a minute, the terrible searing pain had penetrated to the deepest regions of her body. Her lungs burned with a terrible agony, as the immense pressure of a heart attack struck at the very core of her chest. The red splotches on her skin swelled and pulsated, and the veins and arteries in her neck bulged. She gasped in terror; her blood was boiling within her! She coughed up volumes of her life’s essence; it oozed from her nose and the corners of her eyes.
            Her skin finally yielded to the growing pressure from within, and steaming blood issued forth from great rents. Surely she would pass into shock from the total collapse of her internal organs, but she didn’t; if anything she was more alert.
            She was tossed around in the turbulence as her body was reduced to a seething mass of desecrated flesh. She was swept into an erupting plume of black horror, swirled round and round before being cast into the torrid air, and back into the burning sea. Through it all, her tortured flesh still managed to cling to her bones, a ragged reminder of the smooth skin that had once been.
            The incredible regenerative powers of this immortal body would fight an eternal battle with the great sea, preventing her from being completely consumed. Already it had reached an equilibrium in which destruction and regeneration struggled to reach diametrically opposite goals.
            The nature and intensity of her agony also reached equilibrium as she watched the shoreline fade into the distance. Soon her horizon would hold only a lonely vista of fire upon black swirling fury. Thus it would be for all times. Surely there were others here, adrift in this sea of agony, but if there were, they must be scattered far and wide, for she had not yet seen them.
            Hell was real, not a dream, not a fantasy, but a horrible reality, and it would be her reality for all time. With only her agony to keep her company, she would be tossed about forever amid the waves, forgotten by all those she had ever loved, save one. Perhaps she was even forgotten by God. Her eternity had just begun.
