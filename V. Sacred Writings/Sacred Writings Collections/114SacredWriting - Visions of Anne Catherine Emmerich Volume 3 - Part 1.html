<p class="chapterTitle">From the beginning of the public life of Jesus until the first Pasch</p>

 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">Jesus on His Way to Hebron</p>
                               

  <p>
 <sup>1</sup> Jesus went through Nazareth in going from Capharnaum to Hebron, passing through the inde-scribably beautiful country of Genesareth and by the hot baths of Emmaus.  <br>
 <sup>2</sup> These baths were on the declivity of a mountain, about an hour’s distance further on from Magdalum in the direction of Tiberias.  <br>
 <sup>3</sup> The meadows were covered with very high, thick grass, and on the declivity stood the houses and tents between rows of fig trees, date palms, and orange trees.  <br>
 <sup>4</sup> The road was crowded, for a kind of national feast was going on.  <br>
 <sup>5</sup> Men and women in separate groups were playing for wagers, the prize consisting of fruit.  <br>
 <sup>6</sup> There Jesus saw Nathanael, called also Chased, standing among the men under a fig tree.  <br>
 <sup>7</sup> Just at the moment when Nathanael was struggling against a sensual temptation that had seized him and was glancing over at the women’s game, Jesus passed and cast upon him a warning look.  <br>
 <sup>8</sup> Without knowing Jesus, Nathanael was deeply moved by His glance, and thought: “That man has a sharp eye.”  <br>
 <sup>9</sup> He felt that Jesus was more than an ordinary man. He became conscious of his guilt, entered into himself, overcame the temptation, and from that time kept a stricter guard over his senses. <br>
 <sup>10</sup> I think I saw there, also, Nephtali, known as Bartholomew, and that a glance from Jesus touched him also. <br>
 <sup>11</sup> Jesus journeyed with two of His young friends to Hebron in Judea. <br>
 <sup>12</sup> They did not remain faithful to Him. <br>
 <sup>13</sup> They separated from Him, but after His Resurrection, converted by His apparition on Mount Thebez in Galilee, they once again joined His followers. <br>
 <sup>14</sup> In Bethania Jesus visited Lazarus, who looked much older than Jesus; he appeared to me to be fully eight years his senior. <br>
 <sup>15</sup> Lazarus had large possessions, landed property, gardens, and many servants. <br>
 <sup>16</sup> Martha had her own house, and another sister named Mary, who lived entirely alone, had also her separate dwelling. <br>
 <sup>17</sup> Magdalen lived in her castle at Magdalum. <br>
 <sup>18</sup> Lazarus was already long acquainted with the Holy Family. <br>
 <sup>19</sup> He had at an early period aided Joseph and Mary with large alms and, from first to last, did much for the Community. <br>
 <sup>20</sup> The purse that Judas carried and all the early expenses, he supplied out of his own wealth. <br>
 <sup>21</sup> From Bethania Jesus went to the Temple in Jerusalem.</p><br>
 
 

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">The Family of Lazarus</p>

 <p>
<sup>1</sup> The father of Lazarus was named Zarah, or Zerah, and was of very noble Egyptian descent. <br>
<sup>2</sup> He had dwelt in Syria, on the confines of Arabia, where he held a position under the Syrian king; but for services rendered in war, he received from the Roman emperor property near Jerusalem and in Galilee. <br>
<sup>3</sup> He was like a prince, and was very rich. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He had acquired still greater wealth by his wife Jezabel, a Jewess of the sect of the Pharisees. <br>
<sup>5</sup> He became a Jew, and was pious and strict according to the Pharisaical laws. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He owned part of the city on Mount Zion, on the side upon which the brook near the height on which the Temple stands, flows through the ravine. <br>
<sup>7</sup> But the greater part of this property, he had bequeathed to the Temple, retaining, however, in his family some ancient privilege on its account. <br>
<sup>8</sup> This property was on the road by which the Apostles went up to the Cenacle, but the Cenacle itself formed no longer a part of it. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Zarah’s castle in Bethania was very large. <br>
<sup>10</sup> It had numerous gardens, terraces, and fountains, and was surrounded by double ditches. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The prophecies of Anna and Simeon were known to the family of Zarah, who were waiting for the Messiah. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Even in Jesus’ youth, they were acquainted with the Holy Family, just as pious, noble people are wont to be with their humble, devout neighbors. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The parents of Lazarus had in all fifteen children, of whom six died young. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Of the nine that survived, only four were living at the time of Christ’s teaching. <br>
<sup>15</sup> These four were: Lazarus; Martha, about two years younger; Mary, looked upon as a simpleton, two years younger than Martha; and Mary Magdalen, five years younger than the simpleton. <br>
<sup>16</sup> The simpleton is not named in Scripture, not reckoned among the Lazarus family; but she is known to God. <br>
<sup>17</sup> She was always put aside in her family, and lived altogether unknown. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Magdalen, the youngest child, was very beautiful and, even in her early years, tall and well-developed like a girl of more advanced age. <br>
<sup>19</sup> She was full of frivolity and seductive art. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Her parents died when she was only seven years old. <br>
<sup>21</sup> She had no great love for them even from her earliest age, on account of their severe fasts. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Even as a child, she was vain beyond expression, given to petty thefts, proud, self-willed, and a lover of pleasure. <br>
<sup>23</sup> She was never faithful, but clung to whatever flattered her the most. <br>
<sup>24</sup> She was, therefore, extravagant in her pity when her sensitive compassion was aroused, and kind and condescending to all that appealed to her senses by some external show. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Her mother had had some share in Magdalen’s faulty education, and that sympathetic softness the child had inherited from her. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Magdalen was spoiled by her mother and her nurse. <br>
<sup>27</sup> They showed her off everywhere, caused her cleverness and pretty little ways to be admired, and sat much with her dressed up at the window. <br>
<sup>28</sup> That window-sitting was the chief cause of her ruin. <br>
<sup>29</sup> I saw her at the window and on the terraces of the house upon a magnificent seat of carpets and cushions, where she could be seen in all her splendor from the street. <br>
<sup>30</sup> She used to steal sweetmeats, and take them to other children in the garden of the castle. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Even in her ninth year she was engaged in love affairs. <br>
<sup>32</sup> With her developing talents and beauty, increased also the talk and admiration they excited. <br>
<sup>33</sup> She had crowds of companions. <br>
<sup>34</sup> She was taught, and she wrote love verses on little rolls of parchment. <br>
<sup>35</sup> I saw her while so engaged counting on her fingers. <br>
<sup>36</sup> She sent these verses around, and exchanged them with her lovers. <br>
<sup>37</sup> Her fame spread on all sides, and she was exceedingly admired. <br>
<sup>38</sup> But I never saw that she either really loved or was loved. <br>
<sup>39</sup> It was all, on her part at least, vanity, frivolity, self-adoration, and confidence in her own beauty. <br>
<sup>40</sup> I saw her a scandal to her brother and sisters whom she despised and of whom she was ashamed on account of their simple life. <br>
<sup>41</sup> When the patrimony was divided, the castle of Magdalum fell by lot to Magdalen. <br>
<sup>42</sup> It was a very beautiful building. <br>
<sup>43</sup> Magdalen had often gone there with her family when she was a very young child, and she had always entertained a special preference for it. <br>
<sup>44</sup> She was only about eleven years old when, with a large household of servants, men and maids, she retired thither and set up a splendid establishment for herself. <br>
<sup>45</sup> Magdalum was a fortified place, consisting of several castles, public buildings, and large squares of groves and gardens. <br>
<sup>46</sup> It was eight hours east of Nazareth, about three from Capharnaum, one and a half from Bethsaida toward the south, and about a mile from the Lake of Genesareth. <br>
<sup>47</sup> It was built on a slope of the mountain and extended down into the valley which stretches off toward the lake and around its shores. <br>
<sup>48</sup> One of those castles belonged to Herod. <br>
<sup>49</sup> He possessed a still larger one in the fertile region of Genesareth. <br>
<sup>50</sup> Some of his soldiers were stationed in Magdalum, and they contributed their share to the general demoralization. <br>
<sup>51</sup> The officers were on intimate terms with Magdalen. <br>
<sup>52</sup> There were, besides the troops, about two hundred people in Magdalum, chiefly officials, master builders, and servants. <br>
<sup>53</sup> There was no synagogue in the place; the people went to the one at Bethsaida. <br>
<sup>54</sup> The castle of Magdalum was the highest and most magnificent of all; from its roof one could see across the Sea of Galilee to the opposite shore. <br>
<sup>55</sup> Five roads led to Magdalum, and on everyone at one half-hour’s distance from the well-fortified place, stood a tower built over an arch. <br>
<sup>56</sup> It was like a watchtower whence could be seen far into the distance. <br>
<sup>57</sup> These towers had no connection with one another; they rose out of a country covered with gardens, fields, and meadows. <br>
<sup>58</sup> Magdalen had men servants and maids, fields and herds, but a very disorderly household; all went to rack and ruin. <br>
<sup>59</sup> Through the wild ravine at the head of which Magdalum lay far up on the height, flowed a little stream to the lake. <br>
<sup>60</sup> Around its banks was a quantity of game, for from the three deserts contiguous to the valley the wild beasts came down to drink. <br>
<sup>61</sup> Herod used to hunt here. <br>
<sup>62</sup> He had also near his castle in the country of Genesareth a park filled with game. <br>
<sup>63</sup> The country of Genesareth began between Tiberias and Tarichea, about four hours’ distance from Capharnaum; it extended from the sea three hours inland and to the south around Tarichea to the mouth of the Jordan. <br>
<sup>64</sup> The rising valley with the baths near Bethulia, artificially formed from a brook nearby, lay contiguous to this region, and was watered by streams flowing to the sea. <br>
<sup>65</sup> This brook formed in its course several artificial lakes and waterfalls in different parts of the beautiful district which consisted entirely of gardens, villas, castles, parks, walks, orchards, and vineyards. <br>
<sup>66</sup> The whole year round found it teeming with blossoms and fruits. <br>
<sup>67</sup> The rich ones of the land, and especially of Jerusalem, had here their villas and gardens. <br>
<sup>68</sup> Every portion was under cultivation, or laid off in pleasure grounds, groves, and verdant labyrinths, and adorned with walks winding around pyramidal hillocks. <br>
<sup>69</sup> There were no large villages in this part of the country. <br>
<sup>70</sup> The permanent residents were mostly gardeners and custodians of the property, also shepherds whose herds consisted of fine sheep and goats. <br>
<sup>71</sup> There were besides all kinds of rare animals and birds under their care. <br>
<sup>72</sup> No street ran through Magdalum, but two roads from the sea and from the Jordan met here.</p><br>



<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus in Hebron, Dothain, and Nazareth</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> When Jesus arrived at Hebron, He left there His companions, saying that He was desirous of visiting a friend <br>
<sup>2</sup> Zachary and Elizabeth were no more <br>
<sup>3</sup> Jesus then went to the wilderness which lay to the south of Hebron, between it and the Dead Sea, whither Elizabeth had taken the boy John <br>
<sup>4</sup> To reach it, one had to climb a mountain covered with white pebbles, and then cross a lovely valley of palm trees <br>
<sup>5</sup> I saw Jesus entering the wilderness, and going into the cave to which John was first taken by Elizabeth <br>
<sup>6</sup> Then He crossed a little brook over which John also had passed <br>
<sup>7</sup> I saw Him alone and in prayer, as if preparing for His teaching mission <br>
<sup>8</sup> When He left the desert, He went again to Hebron <br>
<sup>9</sup> I saw Him as He journeyed lending a helping hand everywhere along the road <br>
<sup>10</sup> At the Dead Sea, He helped some people who were on a kind of raft formed of beams and covered by an awning <br>
<sup>11</sup> On it were men, cattle, and merchandise <br>
<sup>12</sup> Jesus called to them and shoved a plank out to them from the shore <br>
<sup>13</sup> He helped them to land, and stood by while they repaired their raft <br>
<sup>14</sup> They were at a loss as to who He was; for though there was nothing remarkable in His dress, yet His charming graciousness and dignity of bearing greatly impressed them <br>
<sup>15</sup> At first they thought it must be John the Baptist, who had already made his appearance at the Jordan; but they soon discovered their mistake, for John’s complexion was brown, much darker than that of Jesus, and his whole appearance rough <br>
<sup>16</sup> Jesus celebrated the Sabbath in Hebron, and there dismissed His travelling companions <br>
<sup>17</sup> He visited the sick in their homes, consoling and assisting them in every way <br>
<sup>18</sup> He raised them in His arms, carried them, and made their beds; but I did not see Him curing anyone <br>
<sup>19</sup> To all He appeared to be a benevolent, a wonderful person <br>
<sup>20</sup> He visited the possessed and they grew calm in His presence, though as yet He drove no devil out <br>
<sup>21</sup> Wherever He went, He rendered aid when aid was needed <br>
<sup>22</sup> He raised the fallen, He refreshed the thirsty, He guided the traveler, over bridge and brook—and all looked in astonishment upon the kind-hearted wayfarer <br>
<sup>23</sup> From Hebron He went to the spot where the Jordan flows into the Dead Sea <br>
<sup>24</sup> Here He crossed the river in a boat, and journeyed along its eastern bank to Galilee <br>
<sup>25</sup> I saw Him travelling on between Pella and the country of Gergesa, making short journeys and helping all in need <br>
<sup>26</sup> He went to all the sick, even to the lepers, consoling them, raising them in His arms, making their beds, exhorting them to prayer, and pointing out, to the admiration of all, what treatment was necessary, what remedies to use in the different cases <br>
<sup>27</sup> At one place, some people knew of the prophecies of Simeon and Anna and they questioned Him as to whether He was the one to whom they referred <br>
<sup>28</sup> It was a common thing for people to follow Him from one place to another out of the love He inspired <br>
<sup>29</sup> The possessed were calm when near Him <br>
<sup>30</sup> He went also to the rapid little stream that flows into the Jordan below the Sea of Galilee (the Hieromax), not far from that steep mountain from which He subsequently cast the swine into the sea <br>
<sup>31</sup> Near the river stood a row of little mud huts like shepherds’ huts, which were occupied by the men who were at that moment on the shore laboring at their barks <br>
<sup>32</sup> They could not succeed in their work <br>
<sup>33</sup> I saw Jesus go up to them, make some suggestions in a friendly way, drag a beam to the spot, and put His hand to the work <br>
<sup>34</sup> He pointed out various expedients and, as He worked, exhorted them to patience and charity <br>
<sup>35</sup> After that I saw Jesus in Dothain, a scattered little place northeast of Sephoris, and in which there was a synagogue <br>
<sup>36</sup> The inhabitants were not bad, though very much neglected <br>
<sup>37</sup> Abraham had once owned fields there for his cattle intended for offerings <br>
<sup>38</sup> Joseph and his brethren used to guard their flocks in this same region, and it was here that the former was sold <br>
<sup>39</sup> Dothain, at the time of Our Lord, was but a sparsely settled place, but its soil was good and its meadows extended down to the Sea of Galilee <br>
<sup>40</sup> It contained a large building like a madhouse, in which many possessed lived <br>
<sup>41</sup> On Jesus’ arrival, they became perfectly furious and dashed themselves almost to death <br>
<sup>42</sup> The keepers could not bind them <br>
<sup>43</sup> Jesus entered and spoke to them, and they became quite calm <br>
<sup>44</sup> He addressed to them a few more words, after which they quietly left the house and repaired to their several homes <br>
<sup>45</sup> The people were amazed at what they saw <br>
<sup>46</sup> They were unwilling for Jesus to depart, and one of them invited Him to a marriage feast <br>
<sup>47</sup> I saw all the wedding ceremonies as at Cana <br>
<sup>48</sup> Jesus was like an honored stranger at the feast <br>
<sup>49</sup> He spoke wisely and graciously, giving the bride and groom good advice <br>
<sup>50</sup> They afterward joined the disciples when Jesus appeared upon Thebez <br>
<sup>51</sup> When Jesus returned to Nazareth, He went around among His parents’ acquaintances, but He was everywhere coldly received <br>
<sup>52</sup> When He sought to enter the synagogue in order to teach, they turned Him away <br>
<sup>53</sup> Then He repaired to the public marketplace and spoke of the Messiah to the crowd, of whom some were Sadducees, others Pharisees <br>
<sup>54</sup> He told them that the Messiah would be different from what each one’s ideas pictured <br>
<sup>55</sup> John the Baptist, He called “The voice in the wilderness <br>
<sup>56</sup>  Two youths, clothed in long garments and wearing girdles like priests, had followed Jesus from the country of Hebron; but they went not always with Him <br>
<sup>57</sup> Jesus kept the Sabbath in Nazareth <br>
<sup>58</sup> After that I saw Jesus and Mary, Mary Cleophas, the parents of Parmenas, in all about twenty per-sons, leave Nazareth and go to Capharnaum <br>
<sup>59</sup> They had with them asses laden with baggage <br>
<sup>60</sup> The house in Nazareth had been cleaned and adorned <br>
<sup>61</sup> It was so well arranged that, with its rich hangings, it reminded me of a church <br>
<sup>62</sup> It was left unoccupied <br>
<sup>63</sup> The third husband of Mary Cleophas and some of her sons still carried on business in Anne’s abode, and they took care of that house of the Holy Family <br>
<sup>64</sup> Mary Cleophas with her youngest sons, Joses Barsabas and Simeon, dwelt at this time quite near to the small house not far from Capharnaum which Levi had fitted up for the Lord, and the parents of Parmenas lived at no great distance <br>
<sup>65</sup> Jesus journeyed again from place to place, and appeared chiefly where John had been when he left the desert <br>
<sup>66</sup> He entered the synagogue and instructed, He consoled and relieved the sick <br>
<sup>67</sup> When He taught in the synagogue of a certain little town and spoke of John’s baptism, of the coming of the Messiah, and of penance, the people murmured <br>
<sup>68</sup> They mocked Him, and I heard some of them say: “Three months ago, His father, the carpenter, was still alive <br>
<sup>69</sup> Then He worked with him <br>
<sup>70</sup> Now He has travelled a little and back He comes to impart to us His wisdom" <br>
<sup>71</sup> Jesus went also to Cana and taught. <br>
<sup>72</sup> He had relatives there whom He visited. <br>
<sup>73</sup> At this time He was not yet accompanied by any of His future disciples. <br>
<sup>74</sup> It looked as if He were studying men, and building up upon the foundation that John had laid. <br>
<sup>75</sup> Sometimes a good man accompanied Him from place to place. <br>
<sup>76</sup> Once I saw four men, among them some of His future disciples, on the high road between Samaria and Nazareth. <br>
<sup>77</sup> They were in a shady place waiting for Jesus who, with one companion, was coming that way. <br>
<sup>78</sup> When He arrived in sight, they set forward to meet Him. <br>
<sup>79</sup> They told Him that they had been baptized by John, and that he had spoken of the near coming of the Messiah. <br>
<sup>80</sup> They told Him also of John’s severe language toward the soldiers, only a few of whom he had baptized. <br>
<sup>81</sup> Among other things, he had said that it would be better to take the stones out of the Jordan and baptize them rather than such as they. <br>
<sup>82</sup> I saw these disciples of John walking on with Jesus. <br>
<sup>83</sup> Jesus then went along the Sea of Galilee toward the north. <br>
<sup>84</sup> He spoke very plainly of the Messiah. <br>
<sup>85</sup> In many places, the possessed cried after Him. <br>
<sup>86</sup> Out of one man He drove a devil, and He taught in the schools. <br>
<sup>87</sup> Six men who were coming from the baptism of John met Jesus. <br>
<sup>88</sup> Among them were Levi, known later as Matthew, and two sons of the widowed relatives of Elizabeth. <br>
<sup>89</sup> They all knew Jesus, some through relationship, others by hearsay; and they strongly suspected, though they had had no assurance of it, that He was the One of whom John had spoken. <br>
<sup>90</sup> They spoke of John, of Lazarus and his sisters, especially of Magdalen. <br>
<sup>91</sup> They supposed she had a devil, for she was already living apart from her family in the castle of Magdalum. <br>
<sup>92</sup> These men accompanied Jesus, and were filled with astonishment at His discourse. <br>
<sup>93</sup> The aspirants to baptism going from Galilee to John used to tell him all that they knew and heard of Jesus, while they that came from Ainon, where John bap-tized, used to tell Jesus all they knew of John. <br>
<sup>94</sup> Jesus went alone to the sea, passing through a fence into an enclosed fishery where lay five ships. <br>
<sup>95</sup> On the shore were several huts for the accommodation of the fishermen. <br>
<sup>96</sup> Peter, the owner of this fishery, was in one of the huts with Andrew. <br>
<sup>97</sup> John and James, with their father Zebedee and several others, were on the boats. <br>
<sup>98</sup> In the middle one was Peter’s father-in-law with his three sons. <br>
<sup>99</sup> I once knew all their names, but now I have forgotten them. <br>
<sup>100</sup> The father was surnamed Zelotes, because he had gained his point in a dispute with the Romans concerning the right of navigation on the lake. <br>
<sup>101</sup> There were about thirty men on the boats. <br>
<sup>102</sup> Jesus went along the shore by the fenced-off way between the huts and the boats, speaking with Andrew and the others. <br>
<sup>103</sup> I know not whether he spoke to Peter. <br>
<sup>104</sup> They did not know Him as yet. <br>
<sup>105</sup> He spoke of John and of the near coming of the Messiah. <br>
<sup>106</sup> Andrew was already a baptized disciple of John. <br>
<sup>107</sup> Jesus told them that He would come to them again.</p> <br>



<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus Journeys Over Libanus To Sidon and Sarepta</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> Jesus turned off from the lake, and went further on toward Libanus. <br>
<sup>2</sup> This He was led to do chiefly by the numerous reports current throughout the country and the great excitement to which they gave rise. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Many looked upon John as the Messiah, but others spoke of another whom John’s words seemed to designate. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The companions of Jesus on this journey numbered from six to twelve. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Some turned off at differ-ent points on the road, while others joined Him. <br>
<sup>6</sup> His instructions pleased them, and they began to think that He must be the One of whom John spoke. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Jesus attached Himself particularly to none. <br>
<sup>8</sup> He was properly speaking alone, but He was sowing and preparing. <br>
<sup>9</sup> In all that He did I saw many relations to the actions of the Prophets and to their fulfillment, especially to those of Elias. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Jesus went with His companions over a spur of Libanus toward the great city Sidon lying along the sea. <br>
<sup>11</sup> From the mountain height, the view was indescribably beautiful. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The city was apparently quite close to the sea; but viewed from its own plane, one could see that it was fully forty-five minutes distant from the shore. <br>
<sup>13</sup> It was a large, busy place. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Gazing down upon it from on high, one might fancy that he was looking upon an innumerable fleet of ships; for from the numerous flat roofs arose a forest of high poles and flagstaffs, with long streamers of red and other colors, while white canvas was stretched from pole to pole, or floated in the breeze. <br>
<sup>15</sup> These booths were swarming with people at their different avocations. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Between the houses, I saw all kinds of shining vessels being prepared. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The country around was dotted with exceedingly fertile spots, all teeming with fruit. <br>
<sup>18</sup> In and around these gardens were numbers of immense trees, some surrounded by seats. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Steps led up into others, so that quite a company could sit in their branches as in a summer house. <br>
<sup>20</sup> The plain in which the city lay between the mountain and the sea was not very broad. <br>
<sup>21</sup> There were both Jews and pagans in the city. <br>
<sup>22</sup> They carried on business with one another, and idolatry was general. <br>
<sup>23</sup> The Lord on His way taught and preached in the shady places under the great trees, speaking of John, of his baptism, and of penance. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Jesus was well received in the city. <br>
<sup>25</sup> He had been there once before. <br>
<sup>26</sup> In the school He taught of the coming of the Messiah and of the downfall of idolatry. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Queen Jezabel who so persecuted Elias was from this city. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Jesus left His companions in Sidon, and went to a little place more to the south and away from the sea. <br>
<sup>29</sup> He wanted to be alone to pray. <br>
<sup>30</sup> On one side it was entirely flanked by a wood. <br>
<sup>31</sup> It had thick walls, and was surrounded by vineyards. <br>
<sup>32</sup> It was Sarepta, the place in which Elias was fed by the widow. <br>
<sup>33</sup> The Jews, as also the pagans, had a superstition connected with that fact. <br>
<sup>34</sup> They always allowed pious widows to live in the city walls. <br>
<sup>35</sup> They thought by so doing they secured themselves from every danger, and could practice every species of vice in the city. <br>
<sup>36</sup> Old men dwelt in the walls at the time of which I am now speaking. <br>
<sup>37</sup> Jesus lodged with an old man in the city wall, in the house once occupied by that widow who fed Elias. <br>
<sup>38</sup> The old men who then dwelt in the walls were something like hermits. <br>
<sup>39</sup> They lived there in accordance with an ancient custom honoring Elias, meditating and explaining the Prophecies, and chiefly engaged in prayer for the coming of the Messiah. <br>
<sup>40</sup> Jesus taught them concerning the Messiah and the baptism of John. <br>
<sup>41</sup> They were pious, but entertained many erroneous ideas, of which one was that the Messiah was to come in worldly splendor. <br>
<sup>42</sup> Jesus often retired to the wood near Sarepta and there prayed alone. <br>
<sup>43</sup> He taught in the synagogue, and occupied Himself also in instruct-ing the children. <br>
<sup>44</sup> In the villages around, in which there were numbers of heathens, He exhorted the people not to mix with them. <br>
<sup>45</sup> There were some good people here, and some very bad ones. <br>
<sup>46</sup> Jesus had no companions, excepting occasionally some resident of the place. <br>
<sup>47</sup> I saw Him teaching men and women in the open air, often on hillocks and under trees. <br>
<sup>48</sup> The climate here is such that it always seems to me we are in May, because in Palestine the grain for the second harvest is as far advanced as it is with us in that month. <br>
<sup>49</sup> They do not cut the grain so close to the ground as we do. <br>
<sup>50</sup> They grasp the stalk below the ear, and cut it off about an ell long. <br>
<sup>51</sup> They do not thrash it. <br>
<sup>52</sup> They stand the little sheaves upright and pass over them a roller fastened between two oxen. <br>
<sup>53</sup> The grain is much drier than ours, and falls out readily. <br>
<sup>54</sup> They separate it in the open air, or in a kind of circular barn with a thatched roof, but open on all sides. <br>
<sup>55</sup> From Sarepta Jesus went to a place lying to the northeast, not far from the plain upon which Ezechiel, caught up in spirit, had the vision of the dry bones coming together. <br>
<sup>56</sup> Sinews and flesh took possession of them, the winds passed over them, spirit and life entered into them. <br>
<sup>57</sup> I was told that the coming together of the bones and their clothing with flesh were fulfilled by the teaching and baptism of John. <br>
<sup>58</sup> But the spirit and life breathed into them was accomplished by Jesus through Redemption and by the descent of the Holy Ghost. <br>
<sup>59</sup> Jesus consoled the people, who were very poor and oppressed, and explained to them the vision of Ezechiel. <br>
<sup>60</sup> When He left this place, He went northward to the country which John had first visited on leaving the desert. <br>
<sup>61</sup> It was a little sheep rearing place. <br>
<sup>62</sup> Noemi and her daughter Ruth dwelt there a long time. <br>
<sup>63</sup> Noemi had so good a name among the people that she is still spoken of in those parts. <br>
<sup>64</sup> Later she removed to Bethlehem. <br>
<sup>65</sup> The Lord taught very zealously here. <br>
<sup>66</sup> The time approached for Him to retrace His steps southward and thence to Samaria for His baptism. <br>
<sup>67</sup> Jacob also owned fields up here. <br>
<sup>68</sup> Through this place ran a little river, back of which far up in the desert lay John’s spring. <br>
<sup>69</sup> From this spring the road became very steep, reminding me of that which Adam and Eve took when driven from Paradise. <br>
<sup>70</sup> It led down to the battlefield of Ezechiel. <br>
<sup>71</sup> On Adam and Eve’s route, the trees became smaller and smaller and quite misshapen until at last they reached a desolate region where grew some miserable bushes. <br>
<sup>72</sup> Paradise was as high above the earth as is the sun. <br>
<sup>73</sup> After the Fall it disappeared behind a mountain which seemed to rise before it. <br>
<sup>74</sup> The Saviour, on His return from the shepherds’ country to Sarepta, followed the route trodden by the Prophet Elias when going from the brook Carith to Sarepta. <br>
<sup>75</sup> Jesus taught here and there as He journeyed on, passing by Sidon. <br>
<sup>76</sup> From Sarepta He was soon to go southward for His baptism. <br>
<sup>77</sup> He kept the Sabbath in Sarepta. <br>
<sup>78</sup> After the Sabbath Jesus started for Nazareth, teaching at various points on the road. <br>
<sup>79</sup> He was some-times attended by companions, and sometimes alone. <br>
<sup>80</sup> He went barefoot, putting His sandals on only when about to enter any town or village. <br>
<sup>81</sup> He passed through the valleys toward Mount Carmel, and once He was near the road leading down into Egypt, but He turned off to the east. <br>
<sup>82</sup> The Mother of God, Mary Cleophas, the mother of Parmenas, and two other women, I saw going to Nazareth, while Seraphia (afterward ), Johanna Chusa, and the son of Veronica, who later on joined the disciples, were on their way to the same place from Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>83</sup> They were going to visit Mary, with whom they had become acquainted on their yearly journeys to the Holy City. <br>
<sup>84</sup> Mary and Joseph, as also other pious families, were in the habit of visiting through devotion three places during the year; viz., the Temple of Jerusalem, the pine tree near Bethlehem, and Mount Carmel. <br>
<sup>85</sup> Anne’s family and other pious people usually went to the last named place in May when returning from Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>86</sup> There were on the mountain a well and a cave of Elias, the latter like a chapel. <br>
<sup>87</sup> Devout Jews were constantly visiting these hallowed places. <br>
<sup>88</sup> They came, not at fixed times; but whenever it best suited them, and prayed for the coming of the Messiah. <br>
<sup>89</sup> Jewish hermits dwelt on the mountain, and later on Christian cenobites had there their cells. <br>
<sup>90</sup> In a little town on the west side of Mount Tabor, Jesus taught in the school, and spoke of John’s baptism. <br>
<sup>91</sup> There were five followers around Him, among them some future disciples. <br>
<sup>92</sup> The Sanhedrin of Jerusalem dispatched couriers with letters to all the principal places of Palestine in which were Jewish schools and rabbis, telling them to be on their guard against a certain Man, of whom the Baptist said that He was the One that was to come and that He would soon present Himself for baptism. <br>
<sup>93</sup> They should have an eye upon the Man and give information of His actions; for if He were indeed the Messiah, He needed not the baptism of John. <br>
<sup>94</sup> The members of the Sanhedrin also were very much annoyed when they learned that Jesus was He who as a Boy had taught in the Temple. <br>
<sup>95</sup> The couriers went likewise to a city on the road near Hebron, four hours from the sea, in that country wherein the spies of Aaron and Moses found the huge bunches of grapes. <br>
<sup>96</sup> The city is called Gaza. <br>
<sup>97</sup> There was a very long row of tents reaching from the city to the sea, and under them different kinds of woolen and silk stuffs exposed for sale. <br>
<sup>98</sup> Jesus with five followers taught, here and there, down to the country around Jacob’s Well, where He celebrated the Sabbath. <br>
<sup>99</sup> When He and His companions were returning to Nazareth, the Blessed Virgin went out to meet her Son. <br>
<sup>100</sup> But when she saw that He was not alone, she paused at a distance and went back without saluting Him. <br>
<sup>101</sup> I wondered at her self denial. <br>
<sup>102</sup> Jesus taught in the school at Nazareth, the holy women being present. <br>
<sup>103</sup> The next day, when Jesus taught in the synagogue before a large audience, the holy women were not present. <br>
<sup>104</sup> He was attended by five disciples and about twenty of the young Nazarenes, companions of His boyhood. <br>
<sup>105</sup> His hearers murmured at His teaching. <br>
<sup>106</sup> They whispered among themselves that He would now, perhaps, take possession of the place of baptism that John had abandoned and there baptizing give Himself out for one like unto John. <br>
<sup>107</sup> But, they continued, He was very different from John. <br>
<sup>108</sup> John had dwelt in the desert preparing for his mission, but this Jesus they knew well, and they declared that they would not allow Him to deceive them.</p> <br>
