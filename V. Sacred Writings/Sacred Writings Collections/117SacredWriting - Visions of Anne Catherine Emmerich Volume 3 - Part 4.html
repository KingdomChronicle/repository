<p class="chapterTitle">From the beginning of the public life of Jesus until the first Pasch</p>

 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p class="chapterTitle">A Glance at the Disciples Going to the Baptism</p>
                               

  <p>
 <sup>1</sup> I saw the disciples whom Jesus had dispatched with messages arrive in Capharnaum. <br>
 <sup>2</sup> They were about five of the best-known. <br>
 <sup>3</sup> They had an interview with Mary, and then two of them went to Bethsaida for Peter and Andrew. <br>
 <sup>4</sup> James the Less, Simon, Thaddeus, John, and James the Greater were present. <br>
 <sup>5</sup> The disciples spoke of the mildness, meekness, and wisdom of Jesus, while the followers of John the Baptist proclaimed with enthusiasm the austere life of their master, and declared that they had never before heard such an interpreter of the law and the Prophets. <br>
 <sup>6</sup> Even John spoke enthusiastically of the Baptist, although he already knew Jesus. <br>
 <sup>7</sup> His parents had once lived only a couple of hours from Nazareth, and Jesus loved him even as a child. <br>
 <sup>8</sup> The disciples celebrated the Sabbath here. <br>
 <sup>9</sup> The next day I saw the nine disciples along with those named above on the road to Tiberias, whence they were to go to John, passing near Ephron and then through the desert toward Jericho. <br>
 <sup>10</sup> Peter and Andrew particularly distinguished themselves by the zeal with which they spoke of the Baptist. <br>
 <sup>11</sup> He was, they said, of a noble, priestly race; he had been educated by the Essenians in the wilderness, he would suffer no irregularity around him, he was as rigorous as he was wise. <br>
 <sup>12</sup> Then Jesus’ disciples put forward the mildness and wisdom of their Master, to which the others retorted that many disorders arose from such condescension, and they cited instances in proof of what they said. <br>
 <sup>13</sup> Jesus’ disciples replied that their Master, too, had been educated by the Essenians and that, moreover, He had but lately returned from travelling. <br>
 <sup>14</sup> But John entered not into this discussion. <br>
 <sup>15</sup> I did not hear him saying anything more in that strain. <br>
 <sup>16</sup> They started together for the place of baptism, but after a few hours took different directions. <br>
 <sup>17</sup> As I listened to their conversation, I thought, “Men were then as they now are.”</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus in Gophna</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> Gur, where Jesus prayed alone in the inn, lay not very far from a city, Mageddo, and a field of the same name. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I have clearly seen that, toward the end of the world, there will be fought in that field a battle with Antichrist. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Jesus arose with the dawn, rolled up His couch, laid a coin on it, girded Himself, and went forth. <br>
<sup>4</sup> His way led Him around many towns and villages, but He met no one, put up at no inn. <br>
<sup>5</sup> He passed Mount Garizim near Samaria, which lay to the left, as He journeyed southward. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Occasionally He ate a few berries and some other fruit, and in the hollow of His hand or with a concave leaf scooped up some water to quench His thirst. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Toward evening, Jesus entered Gophna, a city on Mount Ephraim. <br>
<sup>8</sup> It was built upon very jagged foundations, some high, some low, numerous gardens and pleasure grounds scattered between the houses. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Some relatives of Joachim dwelt here, but they had not maintained intimate communications with the Holy Family. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Jesus put up at an inn where they washed His feet and gave Him some little refreshment. <br>
<sup>11</sup> But soon there came to the inn some of His relatives accompanied by a couple of Pharisees of the better sort, and escorted Him to their own home, one of the handsomest houses in the city. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The city itself was of some importance, and possessed at this time jurisdiction over a portion of the country around. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Jesus’ relative was an official, and was much employed in writing. <br>
<sup>14</sup> I think the city belonged to Samaria. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Jesus was received with respect. <br>
<sup>16</sup> There were several guests at His relative’s house and all, standing or walking, took refreshments in a pleasure garden. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Jesus slept here overnight. <br>
<sup>18</sup> It was a day’s journey from Gophna to Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>19</sup> There was a little river in this region. <br>
<sup>20</sup> During the loss of the Boy Jesus in the Temple, the Holy Family went to Gophna in search of Him; for when they missed Him at Machmas, they thought He might perhaps have gone to His relatives there. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Mary feared that He had fallen into the little river. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Jesus, having gone to the synagogue, asked for the writings of one of the Prophets, and taught of baptism and the Messiah. <br>
<sup>23</sup> He proved to His hearers from the Prophets, that the time must have arrived for His appearance. <br>
<sup>24</sup> He cited events which were to precede His coming, and which had actually been accomplished, alluding especially to one that had happened three years before. <br>
<sup>25</sup> I do not now remember whether that particular event was a war, or whether it was that the scepter had passed from Juda. <br>
<sup>26</sup> And so He went on enumerating proofs of accomplished signs which were to precede the coming of the Messiah. <br>
<sup>27</sup> He mentioned also the multiplication of sects and the irreligious nature of so many of their ceremonies. <br>
<sup>28</sup> He told them that the Messiah would be in their midst, and they would not know Him. <br>
<sup>29</sup> He alluded, in words something like the following, to the connection existing between Himself and John: “There will be one who will point Him out (the Messiah), but ye will not acknowledge Him. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Ye wish to see a conqueror, an illustrious personage, a man surrounded by magnificence and eminently learned companions. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Ye will not recognize as the Messiah one that comes among you destitute of wealth and authority, unattended by the pomp of worldly splendor and magnificence, one whose companions are unlettered peasants and laborers, whose followers are made up of beggars, cripples, lepers, and sinners. <br>
<sup>32</sup> In this way Jesus spoke at length, interpreting the Prophecies, and putting forth clearly the con-nection between Himself and John. <br>
<sup>33</sup> Still, He never once said, , but spoke of Himself in the third person. <br>
<sup>34</sup> His instruction occupied the greater part of the day. <br>
<sup>35</sup> His relatives concluded that He must be an envoy, a forerunner of the expected Messiah. <br>
<sup>36</sup> On His return to their house, they referred to a book in His presence wherein they had recorded all that had happened in the Temple to Jesus, the Son of Mary, in His twelfth year. <br>
<sup>37</sup> They were struck by the similarity between what He had then said and His teaching of today, and on perusal of that record they were still more astonished. <br>
<sup>38</sup> The father of the house was an aged widower. <br>
<sup>39</sup> His two daughters, both widows, lived with him. <br>
<sup>40</sup> I heard the two daughters talking together of the marriage of Joseph and Mary in Jerusalem, at which they had been present. <br>
<sup>41</sup> They recalled the magnificence of that wedding, how well-off Anne had been, but how changed the circumstances of the family had become. <br>
<sup>42</sup> They spoke just as people of the world are accustomed to do, a vein of blame and reproach running through their words, as if they of whom they were speaking had greatly degenerated. <br>
<sup>43</sup> While thus conversing and, womanlike, recounting the particulars of the wedding and Mary’s bridal dress, I saw a circumstantial vision of the whole ceremony and especially of the Blessed Virgin’s ornaments. <br>
<sup>44</sup> Meanwhile the men were hunting up what had been written years before about Jesus and His teaching as a Boy in the Temple. <br>
<sup>45</sup> The parents of Jesus had anxiously sought Him here, and it was thus that the news of where and how He was found had reached them. <br>
<sup>46</sup> The affair had attracted much attention, especially as He was a relative of theirs. <br>
<sup>47</sup> While His relatives were still expressing surprise at the connection between His former and His present teaching, by which they were even more prejudiced in His favor, Jesus informed them that He must take leave and, in spite of their remonstrances, set out accompanied by several of the men. <br>
<sup>48</sup> They had to cross a little river over a bridge of masonry on which trees were growing. <br>
<sup>49</sup> They journeyed some hours to a plain covered with meadows. <br>
<sup>50</sup> It was here the Patriarch Joseph was when Jacob sent him to his brethren in Sichem. <br>
<sup>51</sup> The regions from which Jesus had lately come had also been much frequented by Jacob. <br>
<sup>52</sup> Late in the evening Jesus entered a shepherd village this side of a small river, and His companions left Him. <br>
<sup>53</sup> The village lay on both sides of the river, the part on the opposite bank being the larger. <br>
<sup>54</sup> The synagogue was on this side. <br>
<sup>55</sup> The Lord went to an inn where were assembled two sets of candidates for baptism. <br>
<sup>56</sup> They were on their way through the desert to the appointed place. <br>
<sup>57</sup> They had spread the news here of Jesus’ coming. <br>
<sup>58</sup> He conversed with them that evening, and they departed next morning. <br>
<sup>59</sup> The servants washed the Lord’s feet. <br>
<sup>60</sup> He partook of a light repast, and then retired for prayer and rest.</p> <br>



<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus Condemns Herod’s Adultery. The Journey of the Holy Women</p>

 <p>
<sup>1</sup> Next morning Jesus went to the school, where many were assembled. <br>
<sup>2</sup> He spoke, as usual, of the baptism and of the nearness of the Messiah whom they would not acknowledge. <br>
<sup>3</sup> He reproached them for their obstinate adherence to old, meaningless customs, on which point these people had a special failing. <br>
<sup>4</sup> They were, on the whole, tolerably simple-minded and received His remonstrances well. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Jesus requested the High Priest of the synagogue to conduct Him to the sick. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He visited about ten, but cured none; for, in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, He had told Eliud and His five disciples that He would perform no more cures until He had been to the baptism. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The sick in this place were mostly dropsical, gouty, and infirm women. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Jesus exhorted them and told them sepa-rately what religious acts they should perform, according as their infirmities were a part punish-ment of sin. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Some He ordered to purify themselves and go to the baptism. <br>
<sup>10</sup> There was a meal prepared for Him at the inn, at which many men of the place were present. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Before the hour for it these men spoke of Herod, of his unlawful connection with his brother’s wife, blaming him severely and inquiring into Jesus’ opinion on the point in question. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Jesus warmly censured Herod’s conduct and denounced the sin of adultery, but He told them likewise that if they judged others, they would themselves be judged. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Now there were in this place many sinners. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Jesus spoke with them privately and earnestly reproved them for living in adultery. <br>
<sup>15</sup> He told many all their secret sins. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Trembling with fear, they promised to do penance. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Jesus went from here to Bethania, a distance of perhaps six miles, and again entered a mountainous region. <br>
<sup>18</sup> It was the winter season, foggy and cloudy by day, and sometimes white frost by night. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Jesus enveloped His head in a scarf, and journeyed straight on toward the east. <br>
<sup>20</sup> I saw Mary and four holy women leaving the house and wending their way through a field near Tiberias. <br>
<sup>21</sup> They had with them two servants from the fishery. <br>
<sup>22</sup> One went on ahead, the other followed, both laden with baggage which they carried on a pole across the shoulder, a pack in front and another behind. <br>
<sup>23</sup> The four women were Johanna Chusa, Mary Cleophas, Mary Salome, and one of the three widows. <br>
<sup>24</sup> They, too, were going to Bethania by the usual route which ran by Sichem to the right. <br>
<sup>25</sup> When Jesus passed it, it was on His left. <br>
<sup>26</sup> The holy women walked generally in single file, a couple of steps apart. <br>
<sup>27</sup> They went in this way probably because most of the roads, excepting the broad highways, were narrow, intended for foot passengers, and led through the mountains. <br>
<sup>28</sup> They walked quickly with a firm step, not swaying from side to side, as the country people do here. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Very probably this is because from early youth the inhabitants of that country are accustomed to making long journeys on foot. <br>
<sup>30</sup> They had their gowns tucked up to about the middle of the calf, their lower limbs bandaged tightly down to the ankle, and bound to the soles of their feet were thick, padded sandals. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Over the head was a veil, the ends of which were fastened into the scarf wound round the neck. <br>
<sup>32</sup> This scarf was crossed on the breast, thence carried behind and caught in the girdle; sometimes the wearers ran their hands into its folds and there let them rest. <br>
<sup>33</sup> The man, going on before the travelers, prepared the way for them. <br>
<sup>34</sup> He opened the hedges, removed stones from the path, laid bridges, gave orders at the inns and, in fine, saw to everything. <br>
<sup>35</sup> The one who followed put everything again into its first order.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus in Bethania</p>
 
<p>
<sup>1</sup> About six miles from Bethania, the road upon which Jesus was travelling again led through a mountainous country. <br>
<sup>2</sup> That evening He entered a little village consisting of only one street, about half an hour in length, which ran across a mountain. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Bethania was probably still three hours further on. <br>
<sup>4</sup> One could see in the distance the region in which it lay, for it was a low plain. <br>
<sup>5</sup> From this mountain stretched north and east a desert of about three hours in breadth toward the desert of Ephron. <br>
<sup>6</sup> It was between these two deserts that I saw Mary and her companions tonight putting up at an inn. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The mountain is that one upon which Joab and Abisai, in the persecution of Abner, stopped when the latter addressed them. <br>
<sup>8</sup> It is called Amma, and lies to the north of Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>9</sup> The place where Jesus was faced both north and east. <br>
<sup>10</sup> I think it was called Giah. <br>
<sup>11</sup> It was opposite the desert Gibeon, which began at the foot of the mountain and stretched off to the desert Ephron. <br>
<sup>12</sup> It was about three hours long. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Jesus arrived in the evening and entered a house to procure some refreshment. <br>
<sup>14</sup> They washed His feet, and set before Him a drink and little rolls. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Several persons soon gathered around Him. <br>
<sup>16</sup> As He had just come from Galilee, they questioned Him about the Teacher from Nazareth, of whom they had heard so much from John and other sources. <br>
<sup>17</sup> They asked also whether John’s baptism was of any value. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Jesus instructed them in His usual style, exhorted them to baptism and penance, and spoke of the Prophet from Nazareth and of the Messiah. <br>
<sup>19</sup> He said that the latter would appear among them, but they would not acknowledge Him, yea, they would even persecute and ill treat Him. <br>
<sup>20</sup> They must indeed remark that the time was come for His advent. <br>
<sup>21</sup> He would not appear in splendor and triumph. <br>
<sup>22</sup> He would be poor and would walk among the simple. <br>
<sup>23</sup> The people of this place did not know Jesus, but they received Him well and expressed veneration for Him. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Aspirants to baptism had passed through the place and had spoken of Him. <br>
<sup>25</sup> After resting about two hours, He continued His journey accompanied by some of the good people. <br>
<sup>26</sup> He arrived in Bethania at night. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Lazarus had been perhaps for some days at his house in Jerusalem on the west side of Mount Sion, the same side as Mount Calvary. <br>
<sup>28</sup> But he must have heard from the disciples of Jesus’ intended visit to Bethania, for he had come thither in time to receive Him. <br>
<sup>29</sup> The castle in Bethania belonged in reality to Martha; but Lazarus loved to be there, so he and his sister kept house together. <br>
<sup>30</sup> They were expecting Jesus, and a repast was in readiness. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Martha dwelt in a house on the other side of the courtyard. <br>
<sup>32</sup> There were guests assembled in both houses. <br>
<sup>33</sup> With Martha were Seraphia (Veronica), Mary Marcus, and an aged woman of Jerusalem who had been in the Temple when Mary entered and had left soon after. <br>
<sup>34</sup> She had desired to remain, but God had other designs for her, and she married. <br>
<sup>35</sup> With Lazarus were Nicodemus, John Marc, the only son of Simeon, and an old man named Obed, a brother or brother’s son of the Prophetess Anna. <br>
<sup>36</sup> All were, in secret, friends of Jesus, partly through John the Baptist, partly through the Holy Family, and again through the prophecies of Simeon and Anna in the Temple. <br>
<sup>37</sup> Nicodemus was a thoughtful, inquiring man, who was anxiously awaiting Jesus’ coming. <br>
<sup>38</sup> All had received the baptism of John, and all were secretly assembled here at Lazarus’s invitation. <br>
<sup>39</sup> Nicodemus afterward served Jesus and His cause, but in secret. <br>
<sup>40</sup> Lazarus had sent some of his servants to meet Jesus on the way. <br>
<sup>41</sup> About thirty minutes from Betha-nia, Jesus came up with a trusty old servant who afterward joined the disciples. <br>
<sup>42</sup> The old man pros-trated on his face before Him, saying, “I am the servant of Lazarus. <br>
<sup>43</sup> If I have found favor before Thee, my Lord, follow me to his house. <br>
<sup>44</sup> Jesus bade him rise, and followed him. <br>
<sup>45</sup> He was kind to the old man, but at the same time He conducted Himself in accordance with His dignity. <br>
<sup>46</sup> It was just that way of acting that gave Him such power to attract. <br>
<sup>47</sup> People loved the Man, but felt the God. <br>
<sup>48</sup> The servant led Jesus to a porch near a fountain at the entrance of the castle, where all had been prepared for washing His feet and changing His sandals. <br>
<sup>49</sup> He wore thick, green, padded soles which He now exchanged for a pair of stout ones with low, leather uppers. <br>
<sup>50</sup> From that time He continued to wear these latter. <br>
<sup>51</sup> The servant dusted and aired His garments. <br>
<sup>52</sup> When the washing of His feet was over, Lazarus and his friends appeared, bringing to Jesus a light refreshment and something in a drinking cup. <br>
<sup>53</sup> Jesus embraced Lazarus and greeted the others, extending to them His hand. <br>
<sup>54</sup> They served Him hospitably and escorted Him to the house. <br>
<sup>55</sup> Sometime after, Lazarus conducted Him across the courtyard to Martha’s dwelling. <br>
<sup>56</sup> The women there knelt veiled before Him. <br>
<sup>57</sup> Jesus raised them by the hand, and told Martha that His Mother was coming to await there His return from the baptism. <br>
<sup>58</sup> They all went back to Lazarus’ where a meal was awaiting them. <br>
<sup>59</sup> It consisted of roasted lamb, doves, vegetables, little rolls, honey, and fruits. <br>
<sup>60</sup> On the table were cups, and the guests reclined on leaning stools, two and two. <br>
<sup>61</sup> The women ate in an antechamber. <br>
<sup>62</sup> Jesus prayed before the meal began and blessed the food. <br>
<sup>63</sup> He was very grave, even a little sad. <br>
<sup>64</sup> During the repast, He said that a time of trial was approaching, that He was about to begin a toilsome journey, which would come to a bitter end. <br>
<sup>65</sup> He exhorted them, if they were His friends, to stand firm, for like Himself they would have much to suffer. <br>
<sup>66</sup> He spoke so feelingly that they all wept, though they did not perfectly understand Him and knew not that He was God. <br>
<sup>67</sup> That want of understanding on the part of those around Jesus is always a subject of wonder to me, since I have seen innumerable testimonies of His Godhead and mission; and I cannot help asking why was not that, which I perceive so clearly, shown to those people. <br>
<sup>68</sup> I have seen man created by God, Eve taken from his side and bestowed upon him as a wife, and both fallen from their first innocence. <br>
<sup>69</sup> I have seen the Promise of the Messiah, the dispersion of mankind, the wonderful providence of God and His mysteries preparing the way for the coming of the Blessed Virgin. <br>
<sup>70</sup> I saw the descent of the Blessing from which the Word became Flesh running like a path of light through all the generations of Mary’s ancestors. <br>
<sup>71</sup> At last I saw the angel’s message to Mary and the ray of light from the Godhead which penetrated her at the instant the Saviour became Man. <br>
<sup>72</sup> And after all this, how wonderful did it not seem to me, miserable, unworthy sinner, to see those holy contemporaries and friends of Jesus in His presence—though loving and honoring Him—yet pos-sessed by the thought that His Kingdom was to be an earthly one; to see them regarding Him, indeed, as the promised Messiah, and yet never dreaming that He was God Himself. <br>
<sup>73</sup> He was to them only the son of Joseph and Mary, His Mother. <br>
<sup>74</sup> None guessed that Mary was a virgin, for they knew not of her supernatural Immaculate Conception; indeed, they did not even know of the Mystery of the Ark of the Covenant. <br>
<sup>75</sup> It was already a great deal, and a sign of special grace, that they loved Him and acknowledged Him. <br>
<sup>76</sup> The Pharisees, although they knew of the prophecies of Simeon and Anna at the time of His Presentation in the Temple, and who had listened to His wonderful teaching in the Temple when still only a child, were perfectly obdurate. <br>
<sup>77</sup> They had indeed made some inquiries at the time concerning the family of the Child and later on concerning His instructors; but they esteemed Him and His relatives too poor, too insignificant, too despicable. <br>
<sup>78</sup> They wanted a Messiah in every way magnificent. <br>
<sup>79</sup> Lazarus, Nicodemus, and many of the followers of Jesus entertained the secret belief that He was called with His disciples to take possession of Jerusalem, to free the Jews from the Roman yoke, and to establish them in a kingdom of their own. <br>
<sup>80</sup> Truly, it was then as now, when each man might look upon him as a Saviour who would restore his fatherland to freedom and once again establish the beloved old government. <br>
<sup>81</sup> Neither was it known at that time that the Kingdom which alone can help us, is not of this world of penance. <br>
<sup>82</sup> Yes, they indeed rejoiced for the moment in the thought, “Now it will soon be all over with the glory of such or such a tyrant. <br>
<sup>83</sup>  They did not, however, venture to mention their thoughts to Jesus. <br>
<sup>84</sup> They stood in great awe of Him; besides, they could read a fulfillment of their hopes in no trace of His behavior, in no word that He uttered. <br>
<sup>85</sup> After the meal, all retired to an oratory where Jesus offered a prayer of thanksgiving that His time, His mission was now to begin. <br>
<sup>86</sup> It was extremely affecting, and all shed tears. <br>
<sup>87</sup> The women were present, but standing back. <br>
<sup>88</sup> They recited together the usual prayers, after which Jesus gave them His blessing, and was conducted by Lazarus to His chamber for the night. <br>
<sup>89</sup> This was a large room divided off into alcoves where the men slept; but these alcoves were more beautiful than those of ordinary houses. <br>
<sup>90</sup> The beds were not rolled up, as they were in general; they were placed on a kind of stationary platform with a cornice in front ornamented with hangings and fringes. <br>
<sup>91</sup> A fine mat was rolled up on the wall by the bed. <br>
<sup>92</sup> It could, by means of a pulley, be drawn up or let down before the bed, thus concealing it when not in use, and forming a kind of slanting roof. <br>
<sup>93</sup> Beside the bed was a small table, and in a niche of the wall stood a tall water vessel, along with a smaller one for drawing and pouring. <br>
<sup>94</sup> A lamp projected from the wall, and on the arm of the same hung a toilet towel. <br>
<sup>95</sup> Lazarus lighted the lamp, cast himself on his knees before Jesus, who again blessed him, and departed. <br>
<sup>96</sup> Silent Mary, the simple sister of Lazarus, did not make her appearance. <br>
<sup>97</sup> Before others she never uttered a word; but when alone in her room or the garden, she talked aloud to herself and to all the objects around her, as if they had life. <br>
<sup>98</sup> It was only before others that she was perfectly mute and still; her eyes cast down, she looked like a statue. <br>
<sup>99</sup> On being saluted, however, she inclined and was very polite in all her bearing. <br>
<sup>100</sup> When alone, she busied herself in various occupations, attending to her own wardrobe, and keeping all things in order. <br>
<sup>101</sup> She was very pious, though she never appeared in the school. <br>
<sup>102</sup> She prayed in her own chamber. <br>
<sup>103</sup> I think she had visions and conversed with apparitions. <br>
<sup>104</sup> Her love for her brother and sisters was unspeakable, especially for Magdalen. <br>
<sup>105</sup> From her earliest years she had been what she now was. <br>
<sup>106</sup> She had a female attendant, but she was perfectly neat in her person and surroundings with no trace of insanity to be found about her. <br>
<sup>107</sup> No word had as yet been spoken in Jesus’ presence in reference to Magdalen, who was then living at Magdalum in the height of her grandeur. <br>
<sup>108</sup> On the night that Jesus went to Lazarus’, I saw the Blessed Virgin, Johanna Chusa, Mary Cleophas, the widow Lea, and Mary Salome passing the night at an inn between the desert Gibea and the desert Ephraim, about five hours from Bethania. <br>
<sup>109</sup> They slept under a shed enclosed on all sides by light walls. <br>
<sup>110</sup> It contained two apartments. <br>
<sup>111</sup> The front one was divided off into two rows of alcoves, of which the holy women took possession; the back served as a kitchen. <br>
<sup>112</sup> Before the inn was an open hut in which a fire was burning. <br>
<sup>113</sup> Here the male attendants slept or kept watch. <br>
<sup>114</sup> The innkeeper’s dwelling was not far distant. <br>
<sup>115</sup> On the following day, Jesus taught walking about the courtyards and gardens of the castle. <br>
<sup>116</sup> He spoke earnestly, feelingly, and lovingly, though His manner was full of dignity and He uttered no unnecessary word. <br>
<sup>117</sup> All loved Him and followed Him, though not without a sentiment of awe. <br>
<sup>118</sup> Lazarus approached Him the most confidently. <br>
<sup>119</sup> The other men were more reserved; they gazed on in admiration.</p><br>



<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus’ Interview with Silent Mary.
  <br> <sup></sup> His Conversation with His Mother</p>

<p>
<sup>1</sup> Accompanied by Lazarus, Jesus went also to the abode of the women, and Martha took Him to her silent sister Mary, with whom He wished to speak. <br>
<sup>2</sup> A wall separated the large courtyard from a smaller one, which latter, however, was still quite spacious. <br>
<sup>3</sup> In it was an enclosed garden adjoining Mary’s dwelling. <br>
<sup>4</sup> They passed through a gate, and Jesus remained in the little garden while Martha went to call her silent sister. <br>
<sup>5</sup> The garden was highly ornamental. <br>
<sup>6</sup> In the center stood a large date tree, and all around were aromatic herbs and shrubs. <br>
<sup>7</sup> On one side was a fountain or rather a kind of tiny lake with a stone seat in the center. <br>
<sup>8</sup> From the opposite edge to the seat was laid a plank, upon which silent Mary could cross and there sit under an awning and surrounded by the water. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Martha went to her and bade her come down into the garden, for there someone was waiting to speak to her. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Silent Mary was very obedient. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Without a word, she threw her veil around her and followed her sister into the garden. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Then Martha retired. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Mary was tall and very beautiful. <br>
<sup>14</sup> She was about thirty years old. <br>
<sup>15</sup> She generally kept her eyes fixed on Heaven. <br>
<sup>16</sup> If occasionally she glanced to one side where Jesus was, it was only a side glance and vaguely, as if she were gazing into the distance. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Even when speaking of herself, she never used the pronoun, but always as if she saw herself as a second person and spoke accordingly. <br>
<sup>18</sup> She did not address Jesus nor cast herself at His feet. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Jesus was the first to salute, and they walked together around the garden. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Properly speaking, they did not converse together. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Silent Mary kept her gaze fixed on high and recounted heavenly things, as if passing before her eyes. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Jesus spoke in the same manner of His Father and to His Father. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Mary never looked at Jesus, though while speaking she sometimes half turned to the side upon which He was walking. <br>
<sup>24</sup> There was more a prayer, a song of praise, a contemplation, a revealing of mysteries than a conversation. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Mary appeared as if ignorant of her own existence. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Her soul was in another world while her body lived on earth. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Of their speech during that interview, I can remember that, glancing intuitively upon the Incarnation of Christ, they spoke as if gazing upon the Most Holy Trinity acting in that mystery. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Their simple, and yet profoundly significant words I cannot recall. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Mary gazing upon it, said, “The Father commissioned the Son to go down to mankind, among whom a Virgin should conceive Him. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Then she described the rejoicings of the angels, and how Gabriel was sent to the Virgin. <br>
<sup>31</sup> And so she ran through the nine angelic choirs, who all came down with the bearer of the glad tid-ings, just as a child would joyously describe a procession moving before its eyes, praising the devotion and zeal of all that composed it. <br>
<sup>32</sup> Then she seemed to glance into the chamber of the Virgin, to whom she spoke words expressive of her hope that she might receive the Angel’s message. <br>
<sup>33</sup> She saw the Angel arrive and announce the coming of the Saviour. <br>
<sup>34</sup> She saw all and repeated all, as if uttering her thoughts aloud, gazing the while into the distance. <br>
<sup>35</sup> Suddenly she paused, her eyes fixed on the Virgin who appeared to be recollecting herself before replying to the Angel, and said very simply, “Then, thou hast made a vow of virginity? Ah, if thou hadst refused to be the Lord’s Mother, what would have happened? Would there have been found another virgin?” Then addressing her nation, she exclaimed: “Had the Virgin refused, long wouldst thou, O orphaned Israel, still have groaned!” And now, filled with joy by the Virgin’s consent, she burst forth into words of praise and thanksgiving, rehearsed the wonders of Jesus’ birth and, addressing the Divine Child, said, “Butter and honey shalt Thou eat. <br>
<sup>36</sup> She again repeated the Prophecies, recalled those of Simeon and Anna, etc. <br>
<sup>37</sup> spoke with the different personages connected with them, and all this as if gazing upon those scenes, contemporary with them. <br>
<sup>38</sup> At last, descending to the present, she said, speaking as if alone: “Now goest Thou on the painful, bitter way,” etc. <br>
<sup>39</sup> Although she knew that the Lord was at her side, yet she acted and spoke as if He were no nearer to her than all the other visions just recounted. <br>
<sup>40</sup> Jesus interrupted her from time to time with prayer and thanksgiving, praising His Father and interceding for mankind. <br>
<sup>41</sup> The whole interview was inexpressibly touching and wonderful. <br>
<sup>42</sup> Jesus left her. <br>
<sup>43</sup> Relapsing into her usual silence and exterior apathy, she returned to the house. <br>
<sup>44</sup> When Jesus went back to Lazarus and Martha, He said to them something like the following: “She is not without understanding, but her soul is not of this world. <br>
<sup>45</sup> She sees not this world, and this world comprehends her not. <br>
<sup>46</sup> She is happy. <br>
<sup>47</sup> She knows no sin. <br>
<sup>48</sup> Silent Mary, in her altogether spiritual state of contemplation, was really and truly oblivious to all that happened to her or around her. <br>
<sup>49</sup> She was always thus abstracted. <br>
<sup>50</sup> She had never before spoken in the presence of others as she had just done in that of Jesus. <br>
<sup>51</sup> Before all others she kept silence, though not from pride or reserve. <br>
<sup>52</sup> No; it was because she saw not those people interiorly, saw not what they saw, but gazed upon Redemption and the things of Heaven alone. <br>
<sup>53</sup> When at times accosted by a learned and pious friend of the family, she would indeed utter some words audibly, though without understanding a single word of what had been said to her. <br>
<sup>54</sup> Not having reference to or connection with the vision upon which she was interiorly gazing at the time, she heard without hearing; consequently her reply, bearing upon what was then engrossing her own attention, mys-tified her hearers. <br>
<sup>55</sup> It was for this reason that she was regarded by the family as a simpleton. <br>
<sup>56</sup> Her state necessitated her dwelling alone, for her soul lived not in time. <br>
<sup>57</sup> She cultivated her little garden and embroidered for the Temple. <br>
<sup>58</sup> Martha brought her her work. <br>
<sup>59</sup> She was skillful with her needle, which she plied in uninterrupted musing and meditation. <br>
<sup>60</sup> She prayed most piously and devoutly, and endured a kind of expiatory suffering for the sins of others, for her soul was often oppressed as if the weight of the whole world was upon her. <br>
<sup>61</sup> Her dwelling was comfortably fitted up with sofas and different kinds of furniture. <br>
<sup>62</sup> She ate little and always alone. <br>
<sup>63</sup> She died of grief at the immensity of Jesus’ Passion, which in spirit she foresaw. <br>
<sup>64</sup> Martha spoke to Jesus of Magdalen and her own great anxiety on her account. <br>
<sup>65</sup> Jesus comforted her, telling her that Magdalen would certainly be converted, but that she must on no account weary of praying for her and exhorting her to change her life. <br>
<sup>66</sup> At about half-past one the Blessed Virgin arrived with Mary Chusa, Lea, Mary Salome, and Mary Cleophas. <br>
<sup>67</sup> The servant had in advance announced their approach. <br>
<sup>68</sup> Martha, Seraphia, Mary Marcus, and Susanna proceeded to that hall at the entrance of the castle where Jesus the day before had been received by Lazarus. <br>
<sup>69</sup> They took with them refreshments and the vessels necessary for washing their guests’ feet. <br>
<sup>70</sup> After welcoming the newly-arrived and performing for them that duty of hospitality, the latter changed their dress, lowered their skirts, and put on fresh veils. <br>
<sup>71</sup> All were clothed in undyed wool, yellowish-white or brownish. <br>
<sup>72</sup> They partook of a light refreshment, and then accompanied Martha to her house. <br>
<sup>73</sup> Jesus and the men now presented themselves to salute the holy women, after which Jesus retired for an interview with the Blessed Virgin. <br>
<sup>74</sup> He told her most earnestly and lovingly that He was about to begin His career, that He was now going to John’s baptism whence He would return and once more be with her for a short time in the region of Samaria, but that then He would retire to the desert for forty days. <br>
<sup>75</sup> When Mary heard Him speak of the desert, she became very uneasy. <br>
<sup>76</sup> She besought Him not to go to so frightful a place where He would die of hunger and thirst. <br>
<sup>77</sup> Jesus replied that henceforth she should not seek to deter Him by human considerations, for He must accomplish what was marked out for Him; a very different life was now about to commence for Him, and they who would adhere to Him must suffer with Him; that He must now fulfill His mission, and she must sacrifice all purely personal claims upon Him. <br>
<sup>78</sup> He added that although He would love her as ever, yet He was now for all mankind. <br>
<sup>79</sup> She should do as He said and His Heavenly Father would reward her, for what Simeon had foretold was about to be fulfilled—a sword should pierce her soul. <br>
<sup>80</sup> The Blessed Virgin listened gravely. <br>
<sup>81</sup> She was very much troubled, though at the same time strong in her resignation to God, for Jesus was very tender and loving. <br>
<sup>82</sup> That evening Lazarus gave a feast to which Simon the Pharisee, and some others of the sect were invited. <br>
<sup>83</sup> The women ate in an adjacent room, which was separated by a grating from the men’s dining hall, but within hearing of all that Jesus said. <br>
<sup>84</sup> He taught of faith, hope, charity, and obedience. <br>
<sup>85</sup> He said that they who desired to follow Him must not look back. <br>
<sup>86</sup> They should practice what He taught and suffer the trials that might befall them, but that He would never abandon them. <br>
<sup>87</sup> He again alluded to the thorny path before Him, to the buffetings and persecutions He would have to undergo, and impressed upon them the fact, that whoever called themselves His friends, would have to suffer with Him. <br>
<sup>88</sup> His hearers, deeply touched, listened in wonder to His words, but what He said in allusion to His bitter Passion they did not rightly understand. <br>
<sup>89</sup> They did not take His words in their simple and literal meaning, but looked upon them as the figurative expressions of prophecy. <br>
<sup>90</sup> The Pharisees present, though less favorably disposed than the others, found nothing to carp at in Jesus’ speech. <br>
<sup>91</sup> This time, however, He spoke very moderately.</p> <br>


<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">Jesus Journeys with Lazarus to the Place of Baptism</p>

 <p>
<sup>1</sup> The entertainment over, Jesus rested awhile and then started with Lazarus toward Jericho to the place of baptism. <br>
<sup>2</sup> One of Lazarus’ servants went on ahead with a lighted torch, for it was night. <br>
<sup>3</sup> After walking for about half an hour, they reached an inn belonging to Lazarus where at a later period the disciples often stopped. <br>
<sup>4</sup> This inn must not be confounded with that other of which I have often made mention, and at which also the disciples frequently put up. <br>
<sup>5</sup> That one was farther on in an opposite direction. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The hall in which Jesus and Mary were received by Lazarus on their arrival at his house, was the same in which Jesus was stopping and teaching before the resurrection of Lazarus when Magdalen went to meet Him. <br>
<sup>7</sup> On arriving at the inn, Jesus removed His sandals and went barefoot. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Lazarus, touched with compassion, begged Him in consideration of the rough, stony roads not to do so. <br>
<sup>9</sup> But Jesus gravely replied: “Let it be thus! I know what it behooveth Me to do,” and so they entered into the wilderness. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The desert, broken up by narrow chasms, stretched out before them a distance of five hours toward Jericho. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Then came the fruitful vale of Jericho, also interspersed by wild tracts, about two hours’ in breadth, whence to John’s place of baptism was a journey of another two hours. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Jesus walked more quickly than Lazarus, and was often an hour ahead of him. <br>
<sup>13</sup> A multitude, among them some publicans whom Jesus had sent from Galilee to the baptism, were now on their return journey. <br>
<sup>14</sup> They passed Jesus in the desert, though at some distance, on their way back to Bethania. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Jesus stopped nowhere. <br>
<sup>16</sup> He passed Jericho on His left and a couple of other places on the way, but paused at none. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Lazarus’ friends, Nicodemus, Simeon’s son, and John Marc, had spoken but little with Jesus. <br>
<sup>18</sup> But to one another they were constantly interchanging words of admiration at His behavior, His wisdom, His human, yes, even His personal attractions. <br>
<sup>19</sup> In His absence or when walking behind Him, they said to one another: “What a man! There never before was such a one, there never again will be another like Him! How earnest, how mild, how wise, how discerning, and yet how simple! But I cannot perfectly comprehend His words, though I accept them with the thought, ‘He said it!’ One cannot look Him in the face, for He seems to read one’s thoughts. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Look at His figure—how majestic in bearing! How swiftly He moves, and yet no undignified haste! Whoever walked like Him! How quickly He journeys from place to place, and yet shows no signs of weariness! He is always ready to start again for hours. <br>
<sup>21</sup> What a man He has turned out to be!” Then they went on to speak of His childhood, His teaching in the Temple, and referred to the dangers attendant on His first voyage when He had aided the sailors. <br>
<sup>22</sup> But not one of them dreamed that he was speaking of the Son of God. <br>
<sup>23</sup> They saw that He was greater than all other men, they honored Him, and stood in awe of Him; still He was to them only a man, though, indeed, a man full of prodigies. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Obed of Jerusalem was an aged man, the fraternal nephew of the husband of old Anna the Prophetess. <br>
<sup>25</sup> He was a pious man, one of the so-called Elders at the Temple, a member of the Sanhedrin. <br>
<sup>26</sup> He was one of the secret disciples of Jesus and, as long as he lived, lent assistance to the Community.</p><br>


<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">JOHN PREACHING PENANCE AND BAPTIZING - John Leaves the Desert</p>
 
<p>
<sup>1</sup> John received from On High a revelation concerning the baptism, in consequence of which shortly before leaving the desert he dug a well within reach of the inhabited districts. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I saw him on the western side of a steep precipice. <br>
<sup>3</sup> On his left ran a brook, perhaps one of the sources of the Jordan which rises on Libanus in a cave between two ridges. <br>
<sup>4</sup> It cannot be seen from a distance. <br>
<sup>5</sup> To the right lay a level space in the midst of the wilderness, and there he dug a well. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I saw him kneeling on one knee and supporting on the other a long roll of bark upon which he was writing with a reed. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The sun was darting hot beams upon him as he knelt facing Libanus toward the west. <br>
<sup>8</sup> While thus engaged, he became like one entranced. <br>
<sup>9</sup> I saw him as if in ecstasy, and standing by him was a man who drew plans and wrote upon the roll. <br>
<sup>10</sup> When John returned to consciousness, he read what had been written, and at once set vigorously to work at the well. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The bark roll lay beside him on the ground, weighted by a stone at either end to prevent it from rolling together. <br>
<sup>12</sup> John often examined it. <br>
<sup>13</sup> It seemed as if all he had to do was there marked down. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Side by side with his vision of the well, I beheld a scene in the life of Elias. <br>
<sup>15</sup> I saw him sitting in the desert, sad and dejected, on account of some fault he had committed. <br>
<sup>16</sup> At last he fell asleep, and had a dream, in which it seemed to him that a little boy approached and pushed him with a stick, and that he feared falling into a well nearby. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The thrusts he received from the child were so violent as to send him rolling forward some steps. <br>
<sup>18</sup> At this stage of the dream an angel awoke him and gave him to drink. <br>
<sup>19</sup> This took place on the same spot upon which John now dug the well. <br>
<sup>20</sup> I recognized the signification of every layer of earth through which John dug and of every step in the work until its completion. <br>
<sup>21</sup> All had some relation to human obduracy and its other characteristics, which he had to overcome before the grace of the Lord could take effect upon mankind. <br>
<sup>22</sup> This work of John’s was, like all his actions and his whole life, a symbol, a prefiguration. <br>
<sup>23</sup> By it the Holy Spirit not only instructed him what he was to do, but The Holy Ghost urged John on in his work, as formerly the inspired Prophets. <br>
<sup>24</sup> He removed the sod from a wide circumference and dug out of the hard marl a large circular basin, which he very carefully and beautifully lined with stones, excepting in the center where it was dug to a little water. <br>
<sup>25</sup> With the excavated earth, he formed around the basin a rim which he divided into five sections. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Opposite the openings between four of these sections and at equal distances around the basin, he planted four slender saplings whose tops were covered with luxuriant foliage. <br>
<sup>27</sup> These four trees were of different kinds, each bearing its own signification. <br>
<sup>28</sup> But in the center of the basin, he set a very choice tree with narrow leaves; its blossoms hung in pyramidal clusters surrounded by a prickly calyx. <br>
<sup>29</sup> This tree had long lain partially withered before John’s cave. <br>
<sup>30</sup> The four little trees were more like slender berry bushes. <br>
<sup>31</sup> John protected their roots by little mounds of earth. <br>
<sup>32</sup> When the basin had been excavated down to the well, in which later on the central tree was planted, John hollowed out a channel from the brook near his cave to the basin. <br>
<sup>33</sup> Then I saw him gathering reeds in the wilderness, inserting one into the other and, through this conduit (which he covered with earth) conducting the waters of the brook to the basin. <br>
<sup>34</sup> The reed pipe could be closed at pleasure. <br>
<sup>35</sup> He had made a path through the bushes down to one of the openings in the basin’s rim. <br>
<sup>36</sup> It ran all around the basin between it and the four trees I have just described. <br>
<sup>37</sup> Before the opening at the entrance there was no tree, and on this side alone was access to the basin free; on all the others the path was hemmed in by bushes and rocks. <br>
<sup>38</sup> John planted on the mounds at the foot of the four trees an herb well known to me. <br>
<sup>39</sup> I was fond of it when a child and, whenever I found it, I used to transplant it to the neighborhood of my home. <br>
<sup>40</sup> It has a tall, succulent stalk and bears brownish-red, globular blossoms. <br>
<sup>41</sup> It is a very efficacious remedy for ulcers and such sore throats as that from which I am today suffering. <br>
<sup>42</sup> John set around also various other plants and young trees. <br>
<sup>43</sup> During his labor, he consulted from time to time the bark roll before him, and measured all off with a stick, for it seemed to me that every step of the work, even to the trees that he had planted, was therein sketched. <br>
<sup>44</sup> I remember having seen in it a drawing of the middle tree. <br>
<sup>45</sup> John labored thus for several weeks and when he had finished, there was only a small quantity of water in the bottom of the basin. <br>
<sup>46</sup> The middle tree, whose leaves had lately been brown and withered, had now become fresh and green. <br>
<sup>47</sup> In a vessel formed of the bark of a large tree and whose sides had been smeared with pitch, John now brought water from another well and poured it into the basin. <br>
<sup>48</sup> This water was from a well near one of the caves in which John had first dwelt. <br>
<sup>49</sup> It had gushed from a rock upon which he struck with the end of his standard. <br>
<sup>50</sup> I heard that he could not have built the fountain at that earlier dwelling place of his because it was too rocky there, and that, too, had its own signification. <br>
<sup>51</sup> After that he let as much water into the basin from the brook as was necessary. <br>
<sup>52</sup> If the reservoir became too full, the water could flow off by the channels in the rim and refresh the vegetation of the surrounding surface. <br>
<sup>53</sup> I saw John stepping into the water up to the waist. <br>
<sup>54</sup> With one hand he clasped the tree in the center while he struck the water with a little staff to the end of which he had fastened a cross and pennant. <br>
<sup>55</sup> Every stroke sent the water in a spray above his head. <br>
<sup>56</sup> At the same time, I saw descending upon him from above a cloud of light and, as it were, an effusion from the Holy Spirit, while angels appeared upon the rim of the basin and addressed to him some words. <br>
<sup>57</sup> I saw that this was John’s last labor in the desert. <br>
<sup>58</sup> That well was in use even after Jesus’ death. <br>
<sup>59</sup> When the Christians were obliged to flee, the sick and travelers were baptized there; it was frequented also as a place of devotion. <br>
<sup>60</sup> It was at that time, that is during Peter’s time, protected by a surrounding wall. <br>
<sup>61</sup> Soon after the completion of the baptismal well, John left the desert for the haunts of men. <br>
<sup>62</sup> Wher-ever he went, he made a wonderful impression. <br>
<sup>63</sup> Tall of stature, strong and muscular, though emaciated by fasting and corporal mortification, he presented an extraordinarily pure and noble appearance, his manner simple, straightforward, and commanding. <br>
<sup>64</sup> His face was thin and haggard; his expression, grave and austere; his auburn hair in curls over his head, and his beard short. <br>
<sup>65</sup> Around his waist was a tunic that reached to the knee, and his rough brown mantle appeared to be of three pieces. <br>
<sup>66</sup> The back part was fastened around the waist by a strap, but in front it was open, leaving the breast uncovered and the arms free. <br>
<sup>67</sup> His breast was rough with hair almost the color of his mantle, and in his hand he carried a staff bent like a shepherd’s crook. <br>
<sup>68</sup> Coming down from the desert, he built first a little bridge over a brook. <br>
<sup>69</sup> He took no notice of the crossing that lay at some distance, for he never turned out of his way, but worked straight on wherever he went. <br>
<sup>70</sup> There was an old highway in those regions. <br>
<sup>71</sup> He was near Cydessa here, and he instructed the people in the neighborhood. <br>
<sup>72</sup> They were the first pagans that afterward went to his baptism. <br>
<sup>73</sup> They lived in mud huts entirely neglected. <br>
<sup>74</sup> They were the descendants of a mixed multitude who, after the destruction of the Temple, the last one before Jesus’ coming, had settled here. <br>
<sup>75</sup> One of the latest of the Prophets had foretold to them that they should remain in these parts until a man should come to them, a man like John, who would tell them what they should do. <br>
<sup>76</sup> Later on they removed toward Nazareth. <br>
<sup>77</sup> John allowed nothing to prove an obstacle in his way. <br>
<sup>78</sup> He walked boldly up to all he met, and spoke of one thing only, penance and the near coming of the Lord. <br>
<sup>79</sup> His presence everywhere excited wonder and made the lightest grave. <br>
<sup>80</sup> His voice pierced like a sword. <br>
<sup>81</sup> It was loud and strong, though tempered with a tone of kindness. <br>
<sup>82</sup> He treated all kinds of people as children. <br>
<sup>83</sup> The most remarkable thing about him was the way in which he hurried on straight ahead, deterred by nothing, looking around at nothing, wanting nothing. <br>
<sup>84</sup> It was thus I saw him hastening on his way through desert and forest, digging here, rolling away stones there, removing fallen trees, preparing resting places, calling together the people who stood staring at him in amazement, yes, even bringing them out of their huts to help him. <br>
<sup>85</sup> I saw their looks of astonishment. <br>
<sup>86</sup> He tarried long nowhere, but was soon in another place. <br>
<sup>87</sup> He went along the Sea of Galilee, around Tarichea, down to the valley of the Jordan, then past Salem, and on through the desert toward Bethel. <br>
<sup>88</sup> He passed by Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>89</sup> He had never been in the Holy City; he gazed sadly upon it, and uttered lamentations over it. <br>
<sup>90</sup> Entirely possessed by the thought of his mission, on he went, earnest, grave, simple, full of the Holy Spirit, crying aloud the selfsame words: “Penance! Prepare! The Lord is nigh!” He entered the shepherd valley, and journeyed on to the place of his birth. <br>
<sup>91</sup> His parents were dead, but some youths, his relatives on Zachary’s side, resided there. <br>
<sup>92</sup> They were among the first to join him as disciples. <br>
<sup>93</sup> When he passed through Bethsaida, Capharnaum, and Nazareth, the Blessed Virgin did not see him, for since Joseph’s death, she seldom went out of the house. <br>
<sup>94</sup> But several male relatives of her family were present at his exhortations, and accompanied him some distance on his way. <br>
<sup>95</sup> During the three months immediately preceding the baptism, John twice made the circuit of the country announcing Him who was to come. <br>
<sup>96</sup> His progress was made with extraordinary vehemence. <br>
<sup>97</sup> He marched on vigorously, his movements quick though unaccompanied by haste. <br>
<sup>98</sup> His was no leisurely travelling like that of the Saviour. <br>
<sup>99</sup> Where he had nothing to do, I saw him literally running from field to field. <br>
<sup>100</sup> He entered houses and schools to teach, and gathered the people around him in the streets and public places. <br>
<sup>101</sup> I saw the priests and elders here and there stopping him and questioning his right to teach, but soon, astonished and full of wonder, they allowed him to proceed on his way. <br>
<sup>102</sup> The expression, “To prepare the way for the Lord,” was not wholly figurative, for I saw John begin his mission by actually preparing the way and traversing the roads and different places over which Jesus and His disciples afterward travelled. <br>
<sup>103</sup> He cleared them of stones and briars, made paths, laid planks across brooks, cleaned the channels, dug wells and reservoirs, put up seats, resting places, and sheds to afford shade in the various places where later on the Lord rested, taught, and acted. <br>
<sup>104</sup> While thus engaged, the earnest, simple-hearted, solitary man—by his rough garments and conspicuous figure—attracted the attention of the people, and excited wonder when he entered the huts sometimes to borrow a tool, sometimes even to claim assistance from the inmates. <br>
<sup>105</sup> Everywhere he was soon surrounded by a crowd whom he boldly and earnestly exhorted to penance, and to follow the Messiah of whom he announced himself the precursor. <br>
<sup>106</sup> I often saw him pointing in the direction in which Jesus was passing at that moment. <br>
<sup>107</sup> But yet I never saw Jesus with him, although they were sometimes scarcely one hour apart. <br>
<sup>108</sup> Once I saw him at the most only a short hour’s distance from Jesus, crying out to the people that he himself was not the looked-for Redeemer, but only His poor precursor; but that there went the Saviour, and he pointed to Him. <br>
<sup>109</sup> John saw the Saviour face to face only three times in his whole life. <br>
<sup>110</sup> The first time that he did so, was in the desert when the Holy Family were journeying from Egypt. <br>
<sup>111</sup> He had then been hurried by the Spirit to greet his Master whom, years before while still in his mother’s womb, he had saluted. <br>
<sup>112</sup> He felt the nearness of his Saviour, and he knew that He thirsted. <br>
<sup>113</sup> The boy prayed and thrust his little staff into the ground, whereupon a plentiful stream sprang forth. <br>
<sup>114</sup> He then hurried further on the road and took his stand by the running water, to watch Jesus, Mary, and Joseph as they passed by. <br>
<sup>115</sup> When they appeared and as long as they remained in sight, he danced about with joy, waving his little standard. <br>
<sup>116</sup> The second time that John saw Jesus was at the baptism; and third was when, at the Jordan, he rendered testimony to Him as He was passing at a distance. <br>
<sup>117</sup> I heard the Saviour speaking to His Apostles of John’s great self-command; for even at the baptism he had restrained himself within the bounds of solemn contemplation, although his heart was almost bursting with love and desire. <br>
<sup>118</sup> After the ceremony, he was more anxious to abase and humble himself than to yield to his love and seek for Jesus. <br>
<sup>119</sup> But John saw the Lord always in spirit, for he was generally in the prophetic state. <br>
<sup>120</sup> He saw Jesus as the accomplishment of his own mission, as the realization of his own prophetic vocation. <br>
<sup>121</sup> Jesus was not to John a contemporary, not a man like unto himself. <br>
<sup>122</sup> He was to him the Redeemer of the world, the Son of God made man, the Eternal appearing in time, therefore he could in no way dream of associating with Him. <br>
<sup>123</sup> John felt also that he himself was not like his fellow men, existing in time, living in the world and connected with it; for even in his mother’s womb had the Hand of the Eternal touched him, and by the Holy Spirit had he in a way superior to the relations of time, been brought into communication with his Redeemer. <br>
<sup>124</sup> As a little boy he had been snatched from the world and, knowing nothing but what appertained to his Redeemer, had remained in the deepest solitude of the wilderness until, like one born anew, earnest, inspired, ardent, he went forth to begin his wonderful mission, unconcerned about aught else. <br>
<sup>125</sup> Judea is now to him the desert; and as formerly he had had for companions the fountains, rocks, trees, and animals, as with them he had lived and communed, so now did he treat with men, with sinners, no thought of self arising in his mind. <br>
<sup>126</sup> He sees, he knows, he only Jesus. <br>
<sup>127</sup> His word is: “He comes! Prepare ye the ways! Do penance! Receive the baptism! Behold the Lamb of God who beareth the sins of the world!” In the desert, blameless and pure as a babe in the mother’s womb, he comes forth from his solitude innocent and spotless as a child at the mother’s breast. <br>
<sup>128</sup> “He is pure as an angel,” I heard the Lord say to the Apostles. <br>
<sup>129</sup> “Never has impurity entered into his mouth, still less has an untruth or any other sin issued from it. <br>
<sup>130</sup> John baptized in different places: first, at Ainon in the neighborhood of Salem; then at On opposite Bethabara on the west side of the Jordan, and not far from Jericho. <br>
<sup>131</sup> That third place was on the east side of the Jordan, a couple of hours further north than the second. <br>
<sup>132</sup> The last time he baptized was at Ainon, whither he had returned. <br>
<sup>133</sup> It was there that he was taken prisoner. <br>
<sup>134</sup> The water in which John baptized was an arm of the Jordan formed by a bend of the river to the east, and of about an hour in length. <br>
<sup>135</sup> At some places it was so narrow that one could leap over it; at others it was broader. <br>
<sup>136</sup> Its course must have changed here and there, for in many places I saw it dry. <br>
<sup>137</sup> This bend of the river encircled pools and wells which were fed by its waters. <br>
<sup>138</sup> One of these pools, separated by a dam from the arm of the river, formed the baptism place of John at Ainon. <br>
<sup>139</sup> Under the dam ran pipes, by means of which the pool could be emptied or filled at pleasure. <br>
<sup>140</sup> John himself had so arranged it. <br>
<sup>141</sup> On one side of the pool, its waters flowed inland like a creek, and into this extended tongues of land. <br>
<sup>142</sup> The aspirants for baptism stood in the water up to the waist between two of these tongues, supporting themselves by a railing that ran along before them. <br>
<sup>143</sup> On one tongue stood John. <br>
<sup>144</sup> He scooped up water in a shell and poured it on the head of the neophyte, while on the opposite tongue stood one of the baptized with his hand resting on the shoulder of the latter. <br>
<sup>145</sup> John himself had laid his hand upon the first. <br>
<sup>146</sup> The upper part of the body of the neophytes was not entirely nude; a kind of white scarf was thrown around them, leaving only the shoulders bare. <br>
<sup>147</sup> Near the pool was a hut into which they retired for unrobing and dressing. <br>
<sup>148</sup> I never saw women baptized here. <br>
<sup>149</sup> The Baptist wore a long, white garment during the ceremony. <br>
<sup>150</sup> The region in which John baptized was an exceedingly charming and well-watered district called Salem. <br>
<sup>151</sup> It lay on both sides of an arm of the Jordan, but Ainon was on the opposite side of the river. <br>
<sup>152</sup> It was larger than Salem, further north and nearer the river. <br>
<sup>153</sup> Around the numerous creeks and pools of this region were pasture grounds for cattle, and droves of asses grazed in the verdant meadows. <br>
<sup>154</sup> The country around Salem and Ainon was, as it were, free, possessing a kind of privilege established by custom, by virtue of which the inhabitants dared not drive anyone from its borders. <br>
<sup>155</sup> John had built his hut at Ainon on the old foundations of what was once a large building, but which had fallen to ruins, and was now covered with moss and overgrown by weeds. <br>
<sup>156</sup> Here and there arose a hut. <br>
<sup>157</sup> These ruins were the foundations of the tent castle of Melchisedech. <br>
<sup>158</sup> Of this place in particular, I have had visions, all kinds of scenes belonging to early times, but I can now recall only this, that Abraham once had a vision here. <br>
<sup>159</sup> He pulled two stones in position, one as an altar, and upon the other he knelt. <br>
<sup>160</sup> I saw the vision that was shown to him—a City of God like the Heavenly Jerusalem, and streams of water falling from the same. <br>
<sup>161</sup> He was commanded to pray more for the coming of the City of God. <br>
<sup>162</sup> The water streaming from the City spread around on all sides. <br>
<sup>163</sup> Abraham had this vision about five years before Melchisedech built his tent castle on the same spot. <br>
<sup>164</sup> This castle was more properly a tent surrounded by galleries and flights of steps similar to Mensor’s castle in Arabia. <br>
<sup>165</sup> The foundation alone was solid; it was of stone. <br>
<sup>166</sup> I think that even in John’s time, the four corners where the principal stakes once stood were still to be seen. <br>
<sup>167</sup> On this foundation, which now looked like a mount overgrown with vegetation, John had built a little reed hut. <br>
<sup>168</sup> The tent castle in Melchisedech’s time was a public halting place for travelers, a kind of charming resting place by the pleasant waters. <br>
<sup>169</sup> Perhaps Melchisedech, whom I have always seen as the leader and counselor of the wandering races and nations, built his castle here in order to be able to instruct and entertain them. <br>
<sup>170</sup> But even in his time, it had some reference to baptism. <br>
<sup>171</sup> It was also the place from which he set out to his building near Jerusalem, to Abraham, and elsewhere. <br>
<sup>172</sup> Here it was, also, that he assembled the various races and peoples whom he afterward separated and settled in different districts. <br>
<sup>173</sup> Jacob, too, had once lived at Ainon a long time with his herds. <br>
<sup>174</sup> The cistern of the baptism pool was in existence at that early time, and I saw that Jacob repaired it. <br>
<sup>175</sup> The ruins of Melchisedech’s castle were near the water and the place of baptism; and I saw that in the early days of Christian Jerusalem a church stood on the spot where John had baptized. <br>
<sup>176</sup> I saw this church still standing when Mary of Egypt passed that way when retiring into the desert. <br>
<sup>177</sup> Salem was a beautiful city, but it was ruined during a war, I think at the destruction of the Temple before the time of Jesus. <br>
<sup>178</sup> The last Prophet, also, dwelt there awhile. <br>
<sup>179</sup> John, perhaps for about two weeks, had been attracting public attention by his teaching and bap-tizing, when some messengers sent by Herod from Callirrhoe came to him. <br>
<sup>180</sup> Herod was at that time living in his castle at Callirrhoe, on the eastern side of the Dead Sea. <br>
<sup>181</sup> There were numerous baths and warm springs in the vicinity. <br>
<sup>182</sup> Herod wanted John to come to him. <br>
<sup>183</sup> But John replied to the messengers: “I have much to occupy me. <br>
<sup>184</sup> If Herod wishes to confer with me, let him come himself. <br>
<sup>185</sup>  After that I saw Herod going to a little city about five miles south of Ainon. <br>
<sup>186</sup> He was riding in a low-wheeled chariot, and surrounded by a guard. <br>
<sup>187</sup> From its raised seat he could command a view upon all sides as from a canopied throne. <br>
<sup>188</sup> He invited John to meet him in the little city. <br>
<sup>189</sup> John went to a man’s hut outside the city, and thither Herod repaired alone to meet him. <br>
<sup>190</sup> Of their interview, I remember only that Herod asked John why he dwelt in so miserable an abode at Ainon, adding that he would have a house built for him there. <br>
<sup>191</sup> But to this John replied that he needed no house, that he had all he wanted and that he was accomplishing the will of One greater than he. <br>
<sup>192</sup> He spoke earnestly and severely, though briefly, standing the while with his face turned away from Herod. <br>
<sup>193</sup> I saw that Simon, James the Less, and Thaddeus, the sons of Mary Cleophas by her deceased husband Alpheus, and Joses Barsabas, her son by her second marriage with Sabas, were baptized by John at Ainon. <br>
<sup>194</sup> Andrew and Philip also were baptized by him, after which they returned to their occupations. <br>
<sup>195</sup> The other Apostles and many of the disciples had already been baptized. <br>
<sup>196</sup> One day many priests and doctors of the Law came to John from the towns around Jerusalem intending to call him to account. <br>
<sup>197</sup> They questioned him as to who he was, who had sent him, what he taught, etc. <br>
<sup>198</sup> John answered with extraordinary boldness and energy, announced to them the coming of the Messiah and charged them with impenitence and hypocrisy. <br>
<sup>199</sup> Not long after, multitudes were sent from Nazareth, Jerusalem, and Hebron by the Elders and Pharisees to question John upon his mission. <br>
<sup>200</sup> They made his having taken possession of the place chosen for baptism a subject of complaint. <br>
<sup>201</sup> Many publicans had come to John. <br>
<sup>202</sup> He had baptized them and spoken to them upon the state of their conscience. <br>
<sup>203</sup> Among them was the publican Levi, later called Matthew, the son of Alpheus by his first marriage, for he was a widower when he married Mary Cleophas. <br>
<sup>204</sup> Levi was deeply touched by John’s exhortations, and he amended his life. <br>
<sup>205</sup> He was held in low esteem by his relatives. <br>
<sup>206</sup> John refused baptism to many of these publicans.</p><br>
