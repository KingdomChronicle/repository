        <p>(A story written by Melchizedek)</p>

        <p>Revelations that an angel of the Lord manifested to Melchizedek in a dream that took place the night after his coronation, a year after recovering the scepter of Salem, having paid the price of his rescue with pain and blood.</p>



 
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="chapterTitle">The Eternal lived an eternity before creating the Universe. World of Light. Mount Zion. River of life. Garden of Eden. Jerusalem, the city of peace. Lucifer, the firstborn of angels. Laws of divine government. Freedom of choose Angels, ministers of the kingdom of light Universe Abyss of darkness, test of faithfulness Separation between light and darkness.</p>


 <p>
    <sup>1</sup> Before there was a star to shine, before there were angels to sing, there was already a heaven, the home of the Eternal, the only God. Perfect in wisdom, love and glory, the Eternal lived an eternity, before realizing His beautiful dream, in the creation of the Universe. <br>
    <sup>2</sup> The countless beings that make up the creation were all idealized with love. From the tiny atom to the gigantic galaxies, everything deserved His supreme attention. Lover of music, God idealized the Universe as a great orchestra that, under His regency, should vibrate harmonious chords of justice and peace. For each creature He composed a love song. <br>
    <sup>3</sup> The Eternal was very happy, for His dreams were about to come true. Moving with majesty, he began His work of creation. His hands first shaped a world of light, and on him a glowing mountain on which the throne of the Universe would be forever affirmed. <br>
    <sup>4</sup> To the sacred mountain God called: Zion. From the base of the throne, the Eternal brought forth a crystalline river, to represent the life that would flow from Him to all creatures. As a throne room, he created a beautiful paradise that stretched for hundreds of kilometers around Mount Zion. To paradise he called: Eden. To the south of paradise, on both banks of the river of life, numerous mansions adorned with precious stones were built, destined for the angels, the ministers of the kingdom of light. <br>
    <sup>5</sup> Surrounding Eden and the angelic mansions, God built a wall of bright jasper, along which large pearl portals could be seen. With joy, the Eternal contemplated the Dream Capital. The city in its splendor was like an ornate bride, ready to receive her husband. <br>
    <sup>6</sup> Affectionately, the great Architect called her: Jerusalem, the City of Peace. God was about to bring the first rational creature into existence. He would be a glorious angel, among all the most honorable. Adorned by the shine of precious stones, that angel would live on Mount Zion, as representative of the King of kings before the Universe. <br>
    <sup>7</sup> With much love, the Creator began to mold the firstborn of angels. All wisdom applied when forming it, making it perfect. He tenderly granted his life; the beautiful angel, as if waking from a deep sleep, opened his eyes and looked at the face of his Author. With joy, the Eternal showed him the beauties of paradise, telling him of His plans, which were beginning to materialize. <br>
    <sup>8</sup> When he was led to the place of his abode, next to the throne, the prince of angels was grateful and, in a melodious voice, sang his first song of praise. From the heights of Zion, it was discovered, in the eyes of the beautiful angel, Jerusalem in its immensity and splendor. The river of life, sliding serenely in the middle of the City, resembled a long avenue, reflecting the beauties of the Garden of Eden and the angelic mansions. <br>
    <sup>9</sup> Wrapping the firstborn of angels with His mantle of light, the Eternal began to speak to him of the principles that would govern the universal kingdom. Physical and moral laws should be respected to the full extent of divine government. Moral laws were summed up in two basic principles: to love God above all things and others as Himself. Each rational creature should be a channel through which the Eternal could shed other life and light. That way, the Universe would grow in harmony, happiness and peace. <br>
    <sup>10</sup> In the kingdom of God, laws would not be imposed with tyranny; The subjects would be free. Obedience should arise spontaneously, in a gesture of recognition and gratitude. In that realm of freedom, disobedience would also be possible. The result of such behavior would be the emptying of vital forces. <br>
    <sup>11</sup> After revealing to the beautiful angel the laws of His government, the Eternal entrusted him with a mission of great responsibility: he would be the protector of those laws, and should honor and reveal the Universe ready to be created. With a heart overflowing with love for God and others, it would be up to him to be a model of perfection: he would be Lucifer, the bearer of light. The prince of the angels; Grateful for everything, he prostrated himself before the loving King, promising him eternal faithfulness. The Eternal continued His work of creation, bringing into existence innumerable hosts of angels, the ministers of the kingdom of light. <br>
    <sup>12</sup> The Holy City was populated by those radiant creatures who, happy and grateful, joined the voices in beautiful songs of praise to the Creator. God now brought into existence the Universe that, full of life, would revolve around His throne affirmed in Zion. Accompanied by His ministers, he set out for the great accomplishment. After contemplating the immense emptiness, the Eternal raised his mighty hands, ordering the materialization of the multiform wonders that were to compose the Cosmos. <br>
    <sup>13</sup> His order, like thunder, reverberated everywhere, causing, as if by charm, galaxies without numbers, full of worlds and suns — paradise of life and joy — all spinning harmoniously around Mount Zion. When witnessing such a great fact of the supreme King, the angelic hosts prostrated themselves, causing a song of triumph to pass through the illuminated space, in salutation to life. <br>
    <sup>14</sup> The whole Universe joined in that song of gratitude, in promise of eternal fidelity to the Creator. Guided by the Eternal, the angels began to know the riches of the Universe. On that sidereal excursion, they were admired at the immensity of the kingdom of light. Everywhere they found worlds inhabited by happy creatures who received them at party. The angels greeted us with songs that spoke of the good news of that kingdom of peace. <br>
    <sup>15</sup> As precious as life, the freedom to choose, through which creatures could show their love for the Creator, required proof of faithfulness. With the purpose of revealing it, the Eternal led the hosts through the illuminated space, until it approached an abyss of darkness that contrasted with the immense brightness of the galaxies. In the distance, that abyss had revealed itself insignificant in the eyes of the angels, like a spot without light; but as he approached, he showed himself in his enormity. <br>
    <sup>16</sup> The Creator, who at every step revealed to the angels the mysteries of His kingdom, was silent there, as if keeping a secret for Himself. The darkness of that abyss consisted in the test of faithfulness. Turning to the hosts, the Eternal solemnly affirmed: - "All the treasures of the light will be open to your knowledge, except the secrets hidden by darkness. You are free to serve me or not. Loving the light you will be bound to the Source of Life ". - <br>
    <sup>17</sup> With these words, God made separation between light and darkness, good and evil. The Universe was free to choose its destiny.

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chapterTitle">An eternity of harmony and peace. Lucifer, transmitter of the revelations of the Father to his angels. Assemblies on capital planets. Obedience to divine laws, foundation of progress and happiness. Lucifer is attracted by the darkness of the abyss. Lucifer, created for the Light Intervention of a loving Father The great inner struggle of Lucifer The gift of free will Theory of the science of good and evil Foundations of the Eternal kingdom Betrayal of Lucifer and a third of the hosts. The Eternal warns about the breaking of the Source of Life, the Universe put to the test, the inconsolable crying of the Father, the mysterious abyss, symbolic meaning of the kingdom of rebellion, the creation of the planet Earth.</p>

 <p>
    <sup>1</sup> The long-awaited dream of the Creator was concretized. Now, as a loving Father, he led the creatures through an eternity of harmony and peace. By virtue of the fulfillment of divine laws, the Universe expanded in happiness and glory. There was a strong jealousy of love, which united all strongly. Rational beings, endowed with the capacity of infinite unfolding, found indescribable pleasure in learning the inexhaustible treasures of divine Wisdom, transmitting them to the like. They were like channels through which The Source of Eternal Life nurtured all of love and light. <br>
    <sup>2</sup> In Jerusalem, the ministers of the kingdom met before the sovereign King, always ready to fulfill His purposes. It was through Lucifer that the Eternal revealed His designs. After receiving a new revelation, he promptly transmitted it to the angelic hosts. These, in turn, shared it with creation. In famous flight the angels were heading towards the capital planets, where, in large assemblies, the representatives of the other worlds met. In many of these assemblies, Lucifer was present, filling the participants with joy and admiration. Perfect in all virtues, he captivated them with his sympathy. <br>
    <sup>3</sup> No other angel was able to reveal like him the mysteries of the Eternal's love. The Universe, feeding on the Source of Life, expanded into an eternity of perfect peace. Obedience to divine laws was the foundation of all progress and happiness. Although aware of free will, the desire to depart from the Creator had never risen to the heart of any creature. This was the case for a long time, until such a problem broke into the life of the one who was the most intimate of the Eternal. <br>
    <sup>4</sup> Lucifer, who had dedicated his life to the knowledge of the mysteries of light, was gradually attracted to darkness. The King of the Universe, in the eyes of whom nothing can be covered up, sadly accompanied his steps on the downward path that leads to death. At first, a small curiosity led Lucifer to approach that deep abyss. Contemplating it, he began to investigate the reason for not being able to understand its enigma. <br>
    <sup>5</sup> Returning to his place of honor, next to the throne, he prostrated himself before the divine King, begging him: "Father, let me know the secrets of darkness, just as you reveal the light to me." - At the request of the beautiful angel, the Eternal, with an expressive voice of sadness, said: "My son, you were created for the light, which is life." - Convinced that the Creator would not reveal the treasures of darkness, Lucifer decided to understand the riddle for himself. He was judged qualified for so much. With this sad decision, the prince of angels allowed a spot of sin to arise in his heart that could bring a catastrophe to the Universe. <br>
    <sup>6</sup> Only God knew what was going on in Lucifer's heart. The angel, who had been created to be the bearer of light, was divorcing in thoughts of the kind Creator who, in an effort to prevent disaster, begged to remain by His side. A tremendous struggle began to lock inside. The desire to know the meaning of darkness was immense, yet, the pleas of that loving Father, whom he did not want to lose, tortured him. Seeing the suffering that his attitude caused to the Creator, he sometimes showed repentance, but fell again. <br>
    <sup>7</sup> Before creating the Universe, God had already foreseen the possibility of a rebellion. The risk of granting freedom to the creatures was immense, but without this gift, life would be meaningless. The Eternal did not want to reign over robots, programmed to do only His will. He wanted obedience to be the result of recognition and love, so he decided to take the big risk. Although he continued to search for the meaning of darkness, Lucifer did not intend to abandon the light. <br>
    <sup>8</sup> He struggled to reach a combination between those parts that, in the Eternal kingdom, coexisted separately. Finally, with a feeling of exaltation, he conceived a deceptive theory, which he intended to present to the Universe as a new system of government, superior to the Eternal's government. He called his theory "the science of good and evil." Structured in logic, the science of good and evil proved attractive to Lucifer's eyes, seeming to reveal a sense of life superior to that offered by the Creator, whose kingdom enabled only experimental knowledge of good. <br>
    <sup>9</sup> In the new system, there would be a balance between good and evil, between love and selfishness, light and darkness. Throughout the time when the science of good and evil matured in his mind, Lucifer would know how to keep it a secret in front of the Universe. He continued in his position of honor, fulfilling the function of Bearer of Light. However, as much as he tried to pretend, his countenance no longer revealed joy in serving the Eternal. The divine King, who suffered in silence, sought, through His revelations of love, to prepare the rational creatures for the great approach that was approaching. <br>
    <sup>10</sup> He knew that many would listen to temptation, turning his back. The night of the test would make the true faithful stand out, however - those who served the Creator not for interest, but for love. "Seeing that the time of the test was coming, and that Lucifer was ready to betray him before the Universe, the Eternal, who had never ceased to reveal the treasures of his wisdom, became silent and contemplative. <br>
    <sup>11</sup> Silence revived the memory of that first sidereal excursion in the heart of the hosts, when, after showing them the riches of the kingdom of light, God became silent before that abyss. They remembered His words: "All the treasures of light will be open to your knowledge, except the secrets hidden by darkness. You are free to serve me or not. Loving the light you will be bound to the source of life." Lucifer, who He had begun to covet the throne of God, inquired about the motive of His silence.The Creator, contemplating it with infinite sadness, said: "The hour of darkness has come. You are free to carry out your purposes. ” <br>
    <sup>12</sup> Seeing that the propitious moment for the propagation of his theory had arrived, Lucifer summoned the angels for a special meeting. The hosts, eager to know the meaning of the Father's silence, took their places next to the magnificent angel, who had always revealed to them the treasures of the kingdom of light. Lucifer began his speech by exalting, as usual, the government of the Eternal. In a broad retrospective, he reminded them of the great revelations that had enriched them throughout that eternity. <br>
    <sup>13</sup> The divine silence presented him as being the indication that the Universe had reached the fullness of knowledge that came from the light. Silently, the Eternal paved the way for the understanding of mysteries not yet dreamed, kept until then beyond the limits of His government. Surprised, the hosts learned of Lucifer's experience of darkness. With eloquence, he told them about the science of good and evil, indicating it as the path of greatest realizations. <br>
    <sup>14</sup> The effect of his words was soon felt throughout the Universe. The question was decisive and explosive, generating discord for the first time. Rational beings, in their test, would have to choose to remain only with the knowledge of the light, which Lucifer claimed to have reached his limit, or venture into the knowledge of the science of good and evil. In the beginning, the angels debated at the question, then afterwards the entire Universe put to the test. It seemed that the science of good and evil was to take away most of the creatures, however, little by little, many who at first got soaked with the theory, woke up from the illusion of it, reaffirming their fidelity to the kingdom of the light. <br>
    <sup>15</sup> At the end of that conflict, which dragged on for a long time, a third of the stars in the sky were revealed next to Lucifer, and the rest, although shocked by the test next to the Eternal. The science of good and evil was proclaimed by Lucifer as a new system of government. But how to exercise it, if the Eternal continued to reign in Zion? They needed to find a way to get him out of there. The council, formed by the rebel angels, began to deal with that. They decided, finally, to request the throne for a certain time, in which they could demonstrate the excellence of the new system of government. In case it was approved by the Universe, the new system would be established forever; otherwise, the domain would return to the Creator. <br>
    <sup>16</sup> Thus, Lucifer, accompanied by his hosts, approached arrogantly before that suffering Father, making such a request. The Eternal was not ambitious, he only wanted good for His creatures. If the science of good and evil really consisted of a greater good, it would not oppose its implantation, yielding the throne to its defenders. More He knew that this path would lead to unhappiness and death. Moved by His protective love, the Creator disregarded the request of the rebel hosts, who turned away enraged. <br>
    <sup>17</sup> When the throne was denied, Lucifer and his hosts began to accuse the divine King, claiming to be his government of tyranny. They claimed to be his permanence on the throne the most obvious demonstration of His arbitrariness. Hadn't he granted them freedom to choose? Why neutralize it now, preventing them from implementing a superior government system? The accusations of the rebel hosts reverberated throughout the Universe, making it appear that the Eternal's government was unfair. This brought deep distress to those who remained faithful to the kingdom of light. <br>
    <sup>18</sup> Not knowing how to refute such accusations, these creatures, silenced by moral pain, longed for the moment when new revelations from the Creator could clarify the mysteries of that great conflict. The accusations and blasphemies of the rebel hosts reached the climax when the Eternal, in a surprising gesture, rose from His throne, as soon as he left it. The infidels, in the expectation of a conquest, quieted down, while a feeling of fear penetrated the heart of the subjects of the light. <br>
    <sup>19</sup> Would He surrender the dominion of all creation, to get rid of vile accusations? According to the logic from which Lucifer based his teachings, there was no other alternative to the Creator. In this tremendous expectation, the Universe accompanied the steps of God. In a gesture of humility, the Creator stripped himself of His crown and His royal robe, placing them on the white throne. In His countenance there was no expression of resentment or anger, but of infinite love and sadness. With solemnity, the Eternal proclaimed that the decisive moment had arrived, when each creature should seal its decision by the light or darkness. <br>
    <sup>20</sup> In a wide revelation, he warned of the consequences of a break with the Source of Life. With a look of tenderness the Creator looked at his children. It was a look of humility, which, full of love, begged to remain by His side. Countless creatures, moved, corresponded to His look of kindness, while a crowd remained downcast. Lucifer and his followers were aware of the seriousness of that moment. It was still possible to turn back their plans, surrendering repentance to the divine Father who had always loved them. <br>
    <sup>21</sup> While crestfallen considered the final decision, Lucifer and his followers heard the song of those who, in recognition and gratitude, stood beside the Eternal. The last fight was at the heart of the infidels who, shuddering, came to think about retiring. Finally, the memory of the recent divine gesture, stripping the crown, gave them the certainty that the government would be handed over to them. Seeing that the Throne remained empty, Lucifer and his hosts, dominated by greed, finally broke with the Creator. Seeing a third of the subjects go through the divisions of eternal separation, God let out the distressing pain that for so long martyred His heart, curving in inconsolable crying. <br>
    <sup>22</sup> Contemplating His rebellious children, he raised his voice in a painful lamentation: "My children, my children! I can no longer call you that! I would like to have you in my arms so much! I remember when I formed you with love! You came forth happy and perfect, in chords of hope in eternal harmony! I lived for you, covering you with glory and power! You were my joy! Why did your hearts change so much? Oh what else could I have done to make you stay with me? Today my soul bleeds in pain from the eternal separation! <br>
    <sup>23</sup> How will I look to the empty places where so many times the voices raised in festive hosannas, without a mixture of happiness and pain coming to mind ?! Infinite nostalgia already invades my being, and I know it will be eternal! Today my heart broke and broke; I will carry the scars forever! After proclaiming in sorrow so painful lamentation, the Eternal one addressed Lucifer, the cause of all evil, saying: "You received a name of honor when you were created. Now they will not call you more Lucifer, but Satan, the enemy of Creator and His laws. " After lamenting the downfall of the rebel hosts, the Eternal, in slow steps, was absent from the Garden of Eden, place of the Universal Throne. <br>
    <sup>24</sup> Where would His dwelling be now? The faithful hosts accompanied reverent His mysterious steps of abandonment, which seemed to reveal a difficult future, of suffering and humiliation. Would the rebels occupy the divine throne, desecrating it as the domain of sin? This inquiry tortured the hearts of the subjects of the Eternal. Leaving His beloved City, the Lord of light led himself, in the midst of the glories of the Universe, in the direction of the immense abyss, which he had silenced until then. There he stopped once more, muted, while he seemed to read in the darkness a future of great struggles. <br>
    <sup>25</sup> Faced with the suffering of the Eternal, expressed in the sadness of his countenance, the faithful could finally understand the meaning of that mysterious abyss: it consisted of a symbolic representation of the kingdom of rebellion. In the saddened face of God there was, finally, a glow that encouraged the faithful. Raising the powerful arms in the dark, he ordered loudly: "Let there be light." Immediately, the light of His presence flooded the deep abyss and, triumphing over darkness, revealed an unfinished world, covered by crystalline waters. With that gesture, the Eternal began a great battle for the claim of His government of light; battle of love against selfishness; of justice against injustice; of humility against pride; of freedom against slavery; of life against death. <br>
    <sup>26</sup> Battle that, without truce, would extend until, at the desired dawn, the divine King could return victorious to the holy Mount Zion, where, enthroned in the midst of the praises of the redeemed, he would reign forever in perfect peace. The darkness, in its escape, pointed towards the final annihilation of the rebellion. The abundant waters that covered that world, hitherto hidden, symbolized the eternal life that for the faithful would be conquered by the love that everything sacrifices. The revealed world was the earth. Visited by darkness and light, she would be the stage of the great struggle. The faithful rejoiced at the triumph of the light on that first day, when darkness in their fury rolled over the planet, succumbing it in dense darkness. <br>
    <sup>27</sup> The light, which seemed defeated, was reborn victorious in a beautiful dawn. Upon scratching the light of a second day, the Eternal ordered: "There is an expansion in the midst of the waters, and there is separation between water and waters." Immediately, the heat of His light caused an immense amount of steam to rise from the waters, enveloping the planet in a blanket of indigo transparency. Thus the atmosphere arose, with its perfect mixture of gases that would be essential for the life that would soon crown the planet. The Creator, contemplating the expansion, called it "heavens." <br>
    <sup>28</sup> The atmosphere, which filled the earth with brightness, darkened as the twilight of another sunset ensued.

    1 When darkness was overcome on the third day, the Creator continued His work, bringing forth the immense continents that were still beneath the surface of the waters. With raised hands he ordered: "Join the waters under the heavens in one place and the dry portion appears." In prompt obedience, the crystalline waters gave their superior position to the dry portion that rose, overlapping them. In the lower regions of the earth, the waters would continue to reflect the heavenly glow, being a snack for thirsty creatures. In that gesture of humility, the waters foreshadowed the Creator, who in the great struggle had descended into the deepest abyss to make eternal life reborn in thirsty souls.
    2 Contemplating the face of that new world, the Eternal called the dry part "earth," and the gathering of the waters he called "seas." In his powerful voice he continued, ordering: "Produce the earth green grass, grass that gives seed, fruitful tree that bears fruit according to its species, whose seed is in it on the earth." In obedience to the divine command, the solid surface of the planet was covered with all kinds of vegetation: beautiful meadows to bloom, green fields crisscrossed by crystalline rivers, endless forests where leafy trees allowed to hang tasty fruits of countless species. The earth was like a cloth where the Creator, by the power of His word, colored pictures of unparalleled beauty.
    3 While with admiration the hosts contemplated the beauties of that creation, they were surprised to recognize on the new planet the garden of Eden, place of the divine throne. The Eternal, by the power of His word, had transferred him to the bosom of that special world, where in justice the government of the Universe would be confirmed. On that spring day, the breeze gently caressed the green forests and the flowering meadows, flooding the atmosphere with a soft aroma and freshness. Contemplating His work, the Creator happily exclaimed: "Behold, everything is very good." Exuberant, the planet fulfilled another day in its harmonious rotation. The faithful hosts could now better understand the importance of divine light. His absence had obfuscated, on that night, the beauties of Zion. On that new day, the Creator would express His great power, giving the earth luminaries that would fill it with light and heat.
    4 Those luminaries would remain forever as symbols of the spiritual presence of the Eternal, which is the source of all light. Contemplating the dark and empty space that extended around the earth, with a powerful voice he ordered: "Let there be luminaries in the expansion of the heavens, so that there is separation between day and night; be they by signs and for certain times, to days and years. And be for luminaries in the expansion of the heavens to light the earth. " Immediately, the space became radiant due to the brightness of the sun and the reflection of planets and satellites. Before this demonstration of power, the faithful hosts knelt in reverent worship. On the fourth day, the Eternal created the worlds of our solar system not to be inhabited like the earth, but for the balance of the system.
    5 They also filled the sky with glare, softening the darkness of earthly nights. Turning his eyes to the ground, the hosts were glad to see her radiant in colors. Very close to it you could see the moon that, with its silver reflection, would scare away the deep night shadows. Wrapped up by that enchanting scenario, the children of light, rejoicing, greeted the dawn of the fifth day, which would be of many surprises. The Eternal would turn the festive land by the presence of countless species of irrational animals that would inhabit the entire surface of the planet. That creation would have continuity on the sixth day.
    6 Raising the mighty hands, the Creator, looking first at the crystal clear waters, ordered: "Produce the abundantly reptilian waters of the living soul." Immediately, the waters became undulating by the presence of countless species of reptiles that, happy and grateful, celebrated the existence in a continuous swim and jump. From microscopic beings to great whales, all appeared in complete harmony, reflecting in their nature the love of the Creator. Putting his eyes on the indigo atmosphere that rested on the green forests, the Eternal continued: "Birds fly over the face of the expansion of the heavens." Through His order, the Heavens were filled with colorful birds that, flying in all directions, had in their hearts a song of gratitude for life. This song filled the air, mixing with the perfume of flowering bushes.
    7 Contemplating with pleasure His earthly creatures, the Eternal blessed them by saying: "Fructify and multiply and henchid the waters in the seas, and the birds multiply on the earth." Rejoicing, the faithful hosts witnessed the dawn of the sixth day. And what would God create on that new day? This question reigned in the minds of all rational beings. They were sure that something very special was about to happen. Raising the mighty arms, the Eternal ordered: "Produce the living soul earth according to its species: cattle, reptiles and wild beasts of the earth, according to its species." His powerful voice was quickly heard and, in the woods and fields, the result of His creative power could be seen.
    8 Animals of all species woke up to a happy existence, in the middle of a paradise of perfect peace. The land became extremely beautiful, which princess adorned to receive its king and lord. Who would that special being be? Moving with majesty, the Eternal came down to the glories of the new world, heading to the garden of Eden, place of the divine throne. The angels of the light accompanied him reverently, stopping like clouds over the skies of paradise. The entire Universe watched with deep interest the development of the acts of the Creator, in response to the accusations of his enemies.
    9 The moment was decisive. Everything indicated that the Eternal would prove not to be tyrant or selfish, crowning someone on Mount Zion. Satan and his followers did not doubt that the kingdom would be given to them and they would reign victorious in the bosom of that ancient abyss, where darkness and light were now intertwined. The subjects of the light shuddered at that perspective. Next to the source of the river of life, the Eternal knelt solemnly and, with the natural elements of the Earth, began to mold, with much love, a special creature. After a few moments, the body, still lifeless, of the first man was extended before the Creator. The Eternal looked at him and, after stroking his cold, discolored face, he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man began to live.
    10 As if waking up from a dream, the man opened his eyes and contemplated the sweet face of His Creator who, smiling, kissed his face now colorful and full of life. He was moved to hear the Eternal say in a soft and affectionate voice: "My son, my dear son!" Because he was born on earth, the first man received the name of Adam. Taking him by the hand, the Eternal lifted him. Without perceiving the scene of glare that surrounded him, Adam, in a gesture of gratitude for existence, enveloped the Creator in a tender embrace, prostrating himself in reverent worship. The faithful hosts who admired witnessed the great divine fulfillment, excited at the human gesture, also prostrated themselves in reverent worship.
    11 Then they united the voices in a song of joy in salutation to that special creature, who woke up to life at such a decisive moment for the Universe. With a heart full of happiness, Adam joined the angels in his song of praise. His voice, as it passed through the flowery surroundings, was mixed with the song of the birds and the death of the animals that approached festively. In a walk of unforgettable surprises, Adam was made aware of the beauties of his home. With admiration, he saw Mount Zion, where the river of life flowed, in a cascade of light. The glorious mountain lay crowned by a beautiful rainbow. In his steps, he followed the course of the crystalline river, which glided serenely amidst the wonders of Eden.
    12 One admired the tall trees that, soaked by the breeze, left abundant flowers and fruits hanging from the branches. He leaned here and there, attracted by the glow of precious stones that adorned the lawn everywhere. With intense joy, Adam was aware of the infinite species of animals that populated the garden. All were meek and submissive and lived in perfect harmony and happiness. Stopping in his footsteps, Adam admired the whiteness and tenderness of an animal that was jumping on the grass. Approaching, he took it in his arms, dedicating a special affection. Well, it was nice to stroke her white wool! His sweet eyes reflected a glow of love and humility. There was something special about that little animal. Affectionately, Adam called him "lamb."
    13 With the little animal in his arms, Adam looked grateful toward the Eternal and worshiped Him. Contemplating His white robes, His expressive eyes of an unparalleled love, Adam discovered that he had in his arms a symbol of his Author. Happy, he exclaimed: "Oh, Lord, this little lamb clad in such white wool, with an expressive look of so much love, looks like You. I want to have him always with me." Watching the animals, Adam perceived that they enjoyed a special fellowship. I saw happy couples everywhere living for each other. His thoughts turned to His Companion. He looked around and was surprised not to see him. The Eternal had concealed himself on purpose, becoming invisible.
    14 Adam felt lonely in the midst of that paradise. With whom would you share your happiness and love? there were animals there, but they were irrational, unable to share their ideals. He was born in his heart, walking alone in that sunset, a burning desire to find someone who could always be by his side. While Adam looked toward the distant hills in the hope of seeing someone, the Eternal appeared at his side and said: "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a companion."
    15 Adam was happy to hear from the Creator that promise, just at the moment when he so longed to have someone so that he would always be visible at his side. Taken by a deep sleep, Adam leaned back in the chest of his loving Creator who, with caresses, made him numb. In his subconscious the first colorful dreams arose: Contemplate the Eternal's tender gaze; he hears the harmonious sound of angelic music; discover the wonders around: Mount Zion with its rainbow; The river of life; the meadows in bloom; the animals that greeted him at the party. The scenes that surrounded him in his longing are repeated in his dream; he looks around in the hope of finding his partner, but he doesn't see it. He feels lonely in his dream, and that makes him look for someone with whom to share his existence.
    16 His gaze stretches through greening countryside, seeing in the distance flowery hills. While walking hopefully, feel the gentle breeze gently stroke her hair. Talk to the breeze: "Breeze, you seem to be who I am looking for so much; you caress my hair; you kiss my face; you have the perfume of green bushes! If I could see your face, I would kiss it; if I could touch your hair, make long braids and decorate them with the flowers of our garden! " After walking in the dream through the meadows of paradise, Adam stopped while contemplating the surrounding landscape. He admired not seeing the effect of the breeze on the flowering branches. But how, if he felt it warmly on his face?
    17 Then he began to wake up from his dream. Still with his eyes closed, he remembered the moment when, sleepy, he lay on the Eternal's chest. Would the breeze be the touch of His hands? With this question he opened his eyes and was excited to see a pretty woman who, with scented hands, caressed her face with love. It was the breeze of his dream; the promise of a Creator who just wanted to make him happy. Now Adam was complete, for he had Eve, who was flesh of his flesh and bones of his bones. Taking her by the hand, Adam invited her for a walk of unforgettable surprises. He would show his companion the beauties of his home.
    18 Sensitized Eva stopped at every step, attracted by the flowers that exhaled soft perfumes; for the birds that sang happy songs; for the animals that followed them submissive; by the vegetation of rich nuances; through the crystalline waters of the river of life that flowed cascade from Mount Zion. Everything in paradise was perfect and beautiful, but nothing equaled the human being, created in the image of God. They turned to each other in admiration and caresses. Soaked by that love, they remained until sunset. With delight, the young couple began to contemplate the setting sun that, through pink rays, colored the sky in a beautiful tree.
    19 It was the sixth day that came to an end, giving rise to the hours of a special day: Saturday. That day, in its meaning, would be solemn for all subjects of the Eternal, for its dawn would bring victory to the kingdom of light. The sun, which on the sixth day had brightened nature with its brightness and heat, was hidden, leaving it in cold shadows. The cheerful birds, silencing their trills, looked for their nests while the other animals were collected. Only the couple remained motionless, trying to see, in the last flash that went out on the horizon, the hope of a new dawn. They investigated the sense of darkness when, among the bushes, they saw a beautiful place, whose silver rays bathed in silver rays bathed the nature in soft luminosity.
    20 The whole sky was illuminated by the glow of the stars. Admired, they discovered that the night was only darkness when they looked down. Adam and Eve in their innocence did not know that that night symbolized the bleak future of humanity. When they understood it, they would be comforted to contemplate the brightness of the heavens: the place would speak of hope and the twinkling stars would attest to the interest of the hosts of light in clearing their moral darkness, giving encouragement to sinners. But only those who, diverting their eyes from the earth, contemplated the high heavens would be enlightened.
    21 After contemplating the sky for some time in its luminosity, the couple remembered the beauties of paradise, turned their eyes, seeking to see them. They were, however, hidden in the middle of the shadows. How much they wished for dawn, for only he would bring paradise! Before the longing of the human heart, the Eternal appeared in the midst of darkness, returning to the couple the joy of meeting again in a colorful garden. Bathed in soft light, they were now walking through green and flowery meadows. The brightness of the Creator woke up the nature where they passed, coloring and brightening everything around.
    22 The couple, admired, learned that next to the Eternal they could have a paradise in the middle of the night. Feeling sleepy, Adam and Eve lay on the lap of the loving Father, who made them fall asleep sweetly, hopeful in a happy awakening. Leaving them on the soft grass, the Eternal rose to the side of the contemplative hosts. He would manifest again at dawn, waking the couple for the most solemn event, which would reduce to dust the most vile accusations of the enemies. The dark and cold night, through its long hours, seemed to mock the light. Would you forever obfuscate the beauties of creation? Oh, never! The sun would not recede in the face of darkness; He would appear shortly as a liberator, snatching with his warm rays the nature of the cold claws, giving him life and color.
    23 In a final challenge, darkness became dense in the hours before dawn. The night lashed out his forces to fight for usurped rule. Finally, a flash appeared in the east that seemed to speak of hope in a new day. The sky gradually became colorful of a reddish alive. The helpless darkness withdrew from the rising force of light and was consumed in its escape. Nature began to wake up from the long night, reflecting in its bosom the nostalgic rays. Flowers would open, exhaling perfumes of joy; Animals and birds, silenced at night, joined the voices in a triumphant chant in salutation at the dawn of that great day.
    24 The black night had come to an end, giving rise to the daylight dreamed - it was a special meaning for God, because it foreshadowed the final victory of His kingdom over the dominion of rebellion. - The Eternal would now wake up His human children who, bathed in the light of His presence, had slept in the hope of a happy dawn. In a festive march, all the holy hosts, with songs of victory, accompanied him to the paradise bathed in light. When they were close, the Creator stopped staring at the sleeping couple, and exclaimed softly: "Wake up my children." His voice entered Adam and Eve's ears, waking them up for the happiest communion.
    25 How quickly he scratched the long-awaited morning, bringing in his light the sweet paradise, lost in that night! With joy the couple greeted their divine Creator, joining the angels in triumphant antiphons. The Universe lived a truly solemn moment. On that festive morning, the Eternal was to reveal the greatness of His character, which is justice and love. The accusations that His government was selfish and tyranny would be refuted. In the eyes of all the rational creatures of the vast Universe, God led the young couple to Mount Zion, place of the divine throne.
    26 There, before the shudder of the muted hosts, the Creator, in a surprising gesture, covered the man with the royal robe, placing on his head the crown that had been coveted by Lucifer. Moved by deep gratitude for the supreme honor conferred, deep childbirth Adam and Eve bowed reverently, placing their precious crown at the feet of the Creator, in sign of submission. A cry of victory followed that human gesture that shook the entire Creation. The children of the light, who for so long had suffered insults and humiliations in the face of the constant accusations of the rebel hosts, praised in praise the blessed God, who in His work of justice denied the enemies, revealing His character of humility, detachment and love.
    27 Having constituted man as the lord of all creation, the Eternal, with a solemn voice, began to make him aware of the greatness of his mission. As a faithful steward, you should take care of paradise, keeping the source of the river of life clean. The laws of justice and love, foundations of the kingdom of light, should be honored. As a rational scepter, it would be up to man, in a gesture of recognition and gratitude, to freely accept the government of the One who created it. The hosts, who marveled witnessed the revelation of divine detachment, understood that the Lord of Light would no longer rule the Universe, except with human consent.
    28 Man, by the will of the Eternal, was made the arbiter of creation; in his glorious being, made in the image of the Creator, the seal of eternal dominion shone. After revealing to the couple the infinite honor and responsibility of their mission, the Creator made them aware of the spiritual conflict that was working for the conquest of universal dominion: Lucifer, who for countless ages had served the divine King in Zion, had been corrupted by pride and selfishness, being followed by a third of the rational hosts; they sought now to dethrone the Eternal, dishonoring him with vile accusations.
    29 Having revealed to the human being the painful situation in which the Universe was, the Eternal, in a solemn gesture, showed them two tall trees that, loaded with great fruits, rose on both banks of the river that was born from the throne. To the one who rose to the right the Lord revealed to be the tree of life monument of the kingdom of light. To the one who stood on the other shore he revealed himself to be the tree of the science of good and evil - a symbol of rebellion. - By eating the fruit of the tree of life, man would manifest his submission to the Creator, which is the Source of life and light. To eat from the other tree would be to give the enemy the dominion of Zion.
    30 The inevitable result of that step would be eternal death, not only for the human being, but for all creation, which would be reduced to chaos under the fury of rebellion. After contemplating the two tall trees, which externalized in their fruits such infinite responsibility, Adam prostrated himself before the Creator, saying: "You are worthy Lord to reign over the Universe, because by Your wisdom, love and power all things were created and they subsist. " On Saturday, emblem of divine triumph, swelled with praise.
    31 All the children of the light joined the human being in the most harmonious song of exaltation to Him whose greatness is unparalleled. It was with horror that Satan and his followers witnessed the great realization of the Eternal. They witnessed with bitterness the joy of the faithful before the coronation of man, an event that threw down the strong accusations they had raised against the divine government. Full of anger and frustration, they now considered his sad condition. How terrible and humiliating was the thought of seeing their plans of rebellion vanish before the Creator, similar to the shadows of that night.
    32 If they could, they thought, they would fill the Sabbath with darkness, erasing any hope of victory from the minds of the subjects of the Eternal. Finally, in their considerations, Satan and his leaders understood that they had an opportunity: in the middle of the garden of Eden, on the heights of Zion, the tree of the science of good and evil was rising, next to the river of life. . A human gesture would be enough, nothing more, and they would have under their power, for ever, the coveted domain. But how to seduce him? Encouraged by the prospect of a conquest, Satan sought ingeniously to formulate a boarding plan. He knew that if he failed in his attempt, all hopes of triumph would have dissolved, all his dreams of adventure crumbling. He concluded that deception was to be his powerful weapon.
    33 - Was it not through him that he managed to dominate a third of the heavenly hosts ?! He would wait, therefore, for an auspicious moment to arm his ambush. -
