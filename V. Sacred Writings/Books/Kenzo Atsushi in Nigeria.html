kenzo at sushi in nigeria tb joshua
falls prophet
jesus told me my servant satan has
diverted many from my path i did not
offer fame recognition and applause i
said that they would be persecuted and
hated for my name's sake and afflictions
would pass in a short passage i had in
nigeria i heard of the famous synagogue
church of the nations of the prophet t.b
joshua i paid a visit to this temple
that is in the lagos i did not know
about it earlier as i do not watch the
rotten media but i learned of its fame
in nigeria he is a millionaire shepard
is not as poor as many think he has
become wealthy with the money of the
people of nigeria as they entered that
gigantic temple crowds of people were
there i felt a great negative charge a
very heavy energy for a serious church i
stared at this prophet soon my vision
opened behind the altar i saw a black
throne and the name of lucifer there was
a terrible demon who performs many cures
this man tb joshua was doing a lot of
deliverance and exorcism what i saw in
that place was not deliverance it was
demonic manifestations and great
possessions happening in that place this
shepherd called the demons to live in
the bodies of these people legions of
airborne demons came through the roof of
that temple camouflaging inside the
bodies of the people the demons were
silent hidden secretly inside each
person without manifesting passing a
false appearance of liberation they
manifested and then watched that they
had come out getting very still when the
meetings were over people would leave
that place full of demons
in a serious church demons cannot hide
they are forced to manifest because of
the presence of the holy spirit in my
ministry they tried to hide but the fire
of the holy spirit banned them they
could not withstand the fiery flames of
destruction
churches that do not please god do not
have the presence of the holy spirit in
those kinds of churches demons are
resistant and do not manifest if there
is any manifestation of demons it is
only for deception within the church the
holy spirit has revealed to me that this
false shepherd is like a kind of african
messiah who has a charity to help
children and poor people but the reality
is a way to win souls for satan many
have told me that he works miracles in
the name of jesus i said even if i speak
in the name of jesus it does not mean
that it is the holy spirit
matthew 7
22-23
many will say to me in that day lord
lord have we not prophesied in thy name
and in thy name have cast out devils and
in thy name done many wonderful works
and then will i profess unto them i
never knew you depart from me ye that
work iniquity the holy spirit does not
attend to those who do not have the
credentials of jesus the demons operate
even in the name of jesus my vision went
beyond the twelve reservoirs of holy
water in this church they were called
waters of the cleansing of sins where
people came in with tb joshua to bath
the spirit has revealed to me that he is
a fornicator this man seduces women of
his church by prostituting themselves
with them so that they become fertile
and healed from the womb what i saw was
the demon of healing and false
deliverance he does not release the
imprisoned but put more people in the
hands of satan no one from other
ministries has an opportunity to do
healing and deliverance in that place
other than his workers everyone who has
authority from jesus i see a spiritual
ring in his right hand in that false
prophet there was not the ring of god's
authority on his finger all the servants
of god who live the truth i see the ring
of god's authority on his finger those
who do not have the ring and cast out
demons and heal does not come from god i
have seen many people without the ring
operating many wonders there was no fire
of holy spirit in the lives but a demon
on their side performing the cures what
struck me is that on the finger of tb
joshua it was not like the hands of
other false prophets who have no ring he
was the first false prophet that i saw
with a black ring on his left hand this
ring is spiritually equal to the golden
ring of god not to be seen with the
carnal eyes only those that jesus allows
i saw many legions flying on the roof of
that satan synagogue i left that temple
because i could not stand the deception
this is not the first and it will not
even be the last church i visited where
the demons operate signs
already there had been a church of a
bishop who was not freed from vanity and
expelled demons they only pretended that
they would go away for the people to
believe that that woman has authority
from god though she did not leave her
vanities her liberal doctrines were
credible i warned the church jesus does
not give authority to anyone he
delegated his authority to his disciples
and today is in the hands of the true
church jesus would never give authority
to christians to deceive the people with
false doctrine jesus cannot give gifts
to false prophets if jesus did this he
would agree with the deceit comma dot
jesus would never make a covenant with
falsehood when god created the world he
separated the light from the abyss of
darkness as well as those who are in the
darkness of hell cannot pass into the
light of paradise
second corinthians 6
14 comma 15 for what do righteousness
and wickedness have in common or what
communion can have the light with
darkness what harmony between christ and
belial what is there in common between
the believer and the unbeliever jesus is
the light and can have no share with
those who serve the darkness
days after visiting this synagogue
church of the nations i returned to the
hotel i rented in nigeria i had a vision
i saw a church that was covered in
blacktop all in this tarp was five
meters above the ceiling of that church
people prayed and their prayers did not
rise until the skies stopped on the
black cover my vision went further i saw
four wizards performing a great satanic
ritual to block the prayers of that
people i asked jesus why is that church
was losing the war to those wizards
jesus said to me this church is dead in
their iniquities they do not repent of
their sins their prayers have no effect
against the force of evil that these
wizards command seeing the sad situation
of this church i went to pay a visit to
a church when the pastor abbayo miatibo
gave me the opportunity i went up on the
pulpit and said for them to abandon
their sins and make a cry of humiliation
before god the word was of correction
and the people wept repenting and
afterward they made a loud cry my vision
opened i saw an angel with a sword of
flaming fire coming down from the sky
and tearing up that spiritual covering
with the sword when that black covering
was spread out in the middle the prayers
that were held up began to rise to the
sky
helmet of salvation after this vision
the people finished the cry a christian
woman stood i saw a gold helmet coming
down from the sky and wearing her head
demons from outside the church threw
black fireballs at this woman's head but
those balls could not get into that gold
helmet her head was well coated and all
balls hit and fell to the ground i asked
jesus what that means the holy spirit
revealed to me and said she has been
confused about true doctrine many false
churches have implanted a false gospel
in her mind she has heard the lies the
demons were attacking her mind to mess
up and drive her crazy today this spirit
of confusion fell to the ground and left
her life she was clothed with the helmet
of salvation and will never be deceived
she has her mind protected evil dots
will not penetrate her head anymore
through this cry that was in this place
she gave herself and poured out her soul
in the presence of god the prayer of the
church was essential for the defeat of
satan and his wizards to make a covenant
of fidelity abandoning sin after that
site the church ended and i went home
and when i arrived i rested and prayed
till dawn
spiritual warfare i had a terrible
vision i saw an army of demons coming
together to kill me and overthrow my
faith they planned to make me fall and
destroy my ministry in this meeting
demons rose from hell seas earth and air
the principality of nigeria said let's
attack the missionary kenzo we will
destroy his ministry we will attack all
areas of his life he has a point that
will shake your faith we have to
overthrow him and make him sin by
denying his god and then when he falls
into sin we will kill and take his soul
to hell this pastor has revealed our
secrets preaching the truth for the
world we have lost many souls because of
his ministry we are struggling to stop
him now he is making men like him making
disciples and being the mirror to many
many are being raised on earth because
of his ministry if one kenzo is
difficult to stop imagine several kenzo
around the world he has been making
copies of himself
this missionary has been giving a lot of
soul harm to us many who have heard his
preaching have died and are in heaven we
have to stop him we cannot let him
continue every soul that heard this
missionary repaired the lives those who
died are with their god that has kindled
my anger let's put together a strategy
to overthrow his ministry it's just a
man of flawed flesh who feels desires
when i saw this vision i was worried at
night and yet i went to minister in
another church before i climbed the
pulpit i was sitting behind the pulpit
with the pastor adebayo of that church
the holy spirit spoke through him and
gave an account of what he saw pastor
jesus revealed to me that an evil army
ready to attack you jesus told me to
raise a cry for the life of the pastor
tonight we will be presenting the
missionary this morning to god to give
you the strength to face this militia
that has risen against your life after
hearing this revelation i felt a force
inside me i preached that night and went
home the holy spirit said fear not i am
with you they have risen to fall
satanist the next morning i went to buy
some food in the center of the city
among the large crowd a man from a long
distance was looking straight at me this
man approached me and said you are a
christian i replied yes as you know he
said i saw your body shine from afar
like a little light that shines in this
dark city i have talked to men who
called themselves pastors bishops
apostles and missionaries if they did
not tell me they were christians i would
never know their bodies did not shine
their light was off i have the gift and
i see they do not ascend in the rapture
i have been working to prevent the
churches in nigeria from being saved i
have worked with several pastors not to
let this nation rise these people will
welcome the prince of darkness and his
mark i do not have to complain about my
god i made a blood pact with beelzebub
and i work for a large company royal
dutch shell i am the right arm of my
boss i will continue to rise from office
to become the new boss i have everything
i want satan fulfilled my dreams i have
not seen you wage a spiritual warfare i
recognize your worth in the spirit world
i also know that you are at war with the
demons i'm a high-level satanist i know
what's going on in the spirit world i'm
on the inside of the spiritual world
news the demon named pazuzu spoke of you
to me you are very famous in the
spiritual world and you are looking like
a celebrity not all christians who have
their names spoken in demonic meetings
only those who live the holy gospel and
go through all the tribulations that
have the names well spoken tell me kenzo
i answered the satanist you know my name
without knowing me it can only be the
demons that spoke to you antichrist the
satanist answered me that's right he
told me you were the devils people look
at me and they do not believe that i'm a
sorcerer because i look elegant i am a
friend of several pastors i have no
enemy jesus said that we have to love
our neighbor i have no reason to wage
war with you we will not gain anything
from it i want to make an alliance with
all christian churches and religions
soon all will unite in one love to
receive the antichrist who will rule the
world i will overcome this war by making
alliances with the churches and defiling
the holy gospel i will never overcome
this war by speaking evil of christians
but by uniting and loving they will
defeat my mission is to bring together
all peoples of different religions
peoples and races for the arrival of our
king a new era will come and all
religions will disappear only a single
religion will exist anti-christianity
when the satanist spoke these words he
disappeared from my front and appeared
30 meters away then disappeared i do not
know where he went i went back home
wondering if that man was a man or a
demon he had disappeared just like a
spirit i bowed my knee praying to god
asking for revelation if that man was
real
jesus showed me in a vision this man
being transported to various places and
cities he did not drive because he had
this ability the demon that possessed
him could make his body move from one
place to another at high speed
jesus revealed to me that he's just a
man not a demon like i thought jesus
told me no matter how much i condemn the
evil deeds i love this soul and i want
to save him this man made a pact with
satan and in the contract it was written
that he would have this ability to move
he is being deceived satan promised
great things and will not fulfill his
deal in this covenant he is a liar no
matter how faithful that satanist is in
the covenant satan is plotting to reap
his soul to keep what he has promised
and the sorcerer does not know i would
bring him to you to take the word
causing him to escape from death and
gain salvation
satan has not yet taken his life because
he is useful to his purposes when he
does not need him anymore he will kill
him and put another one to replace him
my servant i am love i do not use and
play out like satan i always lead you
closer to my presence at the end of the
revelation jesus showed me in a vision
that satan is doing a ritual to kill a
christian in order to stay with his wife
this satanist cast a spell on this
christian's wife she was not clothed in
god's armor that magic entered her mind
this christian woman fell in love with
the satanist and left her husband this
man had strong magnetism on christian
women that was not the first he would do
ritual with a female skull pick up
strands of hair in his sister's salon
this satanist had already made more than
50 women fall in love with him through
the ritual of the skull they were
maddened with love for him based on the
spells cast on them i saw a demon
staring inside the head of every woman
going crazy for the sorcerer he did
rituals for businessmen to go crazy and
deposit money into his account the
demons controlled the minds of the
entrepreneurs making them deposit money
into his account the lord said despite
his evil deeds i want to forgive him and
bring him in my way after these visions
a few days later i meet with this
satanist again he said he thought well
of our covenant i replied repent of your
sins leave sorcery you have little time
of life satan is misleading your soul
the satanist said i gained the eternal
life of satan himself i took the elixir
of immortality drank a lot of herbs made
by my master who initiated me into
witchcraft why will i serve your god
that will never give me riches look at
you a poor man and still serve this god
you know what will happen if i drop
satan he will take everything he gave me
and your god will not do anything to
restore my losses i replied satan also
offered me riches the media tried to
make me famous
entrepreneurs offered me a lot of money
so i could drop my job and work for
their companies churches tried to make
me known in the four corners of the
world all this i rejected to be this
pro-man
satan tried to corrupt me to make me
famous i was separated from these things
to be known i accepted to diminish
myself so that the glory of god grows
the media is satanic and serves to boast
man and not god i made a covenant with
god he told me that he would exalt me as
long as i did not seek the media and
recognition i'd rather be anonymous
lower myself and be a simple man when i
had finished speaking these words the
satanist moved and disappeared from me
months later before i fell asleep i had
a vision in the night i saw a demon in
the form of a shadow entering inside his
house he pushed his black hand into the
satanist's chest crushing his heart he
fell to the ground writing in pain and
the demons caught his soul at dawn i was
worried i took my bible and went to the
city to meet him jesus said do not go
after him you have already done your
part he rejected me he did not believe
your words jesus gave me a vision last
night that will be fulfilled his death
has already been decreed two weeks later
i saw the news that he died he was very
well known in that city spirit of
seduction the night before bed i locked
the house when i laid down a woman
appeared to me that beautiful woman got
into the residence where i was she was
naked and tried to seduce me to sin she
wanted me to open my heart and call her
to bed with me she said you are tough no
christian could resist me there were
several who fell they came to do
missions in my country and returned
deviants i said how did you come here if
everything is closed it is no use
his available fell now and showed its
true form that beautiful woman could not
resist first turned into a spirit then
into a monster of horns at the time i
saw the sky open my angel came down to
me and my guardian angel appeared and
together they fought with that monster
causing him to flee
that devil wanted to make me fall into
prostitution it is a sin for the wicked
to prostitute himself and the greater is
the sin when one who knows the truth and
falls into the bond of prostitution and
committing adultery with a demon that
has materialized is a terrible
abomination before god this demon knew
that if he sent a human woman i would
not fall so he came in the form of a
model himself when satan wants to
destroy a man of god he offers
attractive things by close this
experience of november 2015 that the
glory of jesus accompanies all of you
little children i love you amen
