        <p>Kenzo Atsushi and Congo 3</p>
        

        <!-------------------------------START OF LESSON 1  ------------------------------->
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Kenzo Atsushi and Congo 3</p>


        <p>
        I was in the city of Pointe-Noire in the Congo when I had a vision. I saw Satan throwing an arrow, like a black ball. This deadly arrow entered the mind of the wizard chief of the town of Kalami, who died of a stroke. When God showed me this, I realized he had died two days earlier. In my vision, I saw him suffering in hell, in the valley of sorcerers. <br><br>

        In Pointe-Noire, there was a man known and feared in the village—he was called Pal Mulumba, the sorcerer of that region. Rumors spread that he would become a werewolf. He had attacked and killed several people; some even showed me the marks of his teeth on their arms. The region has a beautiful forest, but many are too afraid to walk there, fearing an attack by this beast-man. The local police tried to catch him but failed, as he had a magic spell that allowed him to disappear from one place and appear in another.<br><br>

        I met a policeman from the region named Upango. He said the police had no proof to arrest the sorcerer because the attacks were attributed to a wolf, not a man. Upango recounted that they had gone to the sorcerer’s house with four policemen to summon him to the police district for testimony. Upon their arrival, the sorcerer locked his doors and vanished. When the police searched the house, he was nowhere to be found. After that raid, many policemen began to die of mysterious diseases. Upango believed it was a curse cast by the sorcerer on those who raided his home. Fearing more deaths, the police gave up interrogating him.<br><br>

        Upango explained that Mulumba suffered from lycanthropy—a form of madness involving the delusion of being an animal, usually a wolf, with corresponding behavior. Although Upango had never seen him transform, others claimed to have witnessed it and even moved away out of fear. Upango did not believe Mulumba was a werewolf but feared his black magic.<br><br>

        Hearing all this, I was unsure what to believe. To me, it sounded like a popular tale or myth, but with African sorcerers of high spiritual level, perhaps there was some truth. I was certain that this same sorcerer held hegemony in the country, alongside the chief of sorcerers in the neighboring town of Kalami, where I had led a community to Jesus.<br><br>

        I returned home to clear my doubts. I knelt and prayed for three hours without stopping. The Lord showed me a vision of the sorcerer Mulumba. I saw a legion of demons enter his body, making him unreasonable. The demons moved in his mind, and his behavior became like that of a wild animal. They altered his testosterone levels, causing hair to grow all over his body—chest, belly, arms, and face—like a werewolf. His personality changed, behaving just like an animal, much like King Nebuchadnezzar, who became irrational and lived like a beast, as described in Daniel 4:32-33.<br><br>

        In the vision, Mulumba was bearded and covered in hair, but not exactly like the werewolves in movies. He was a ferocious, irrational man who did not walk on all fours but resembled a wild animal. I saw him attack and eat an antelope. It was horrifying.<br><br>

        The next day, on my way back from church, I passed a deserted road and saw a bearded man following me. He avoided the light. When I entered my house and looked out the window, I saw him in the dark. He started to howl and moved on all fours. He was a man, not a dog, but possessed by the spirit of a beast. His clothes were torn and filthy. He watched the house, waiting to see if I would leave. He was even more irrational, behaving like a dog, just as in the vision where he attacked the antelope. I could sense the strength of the legion within him.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Encounter with the Sorcerer</p>
        

        <p>
        The next morning, I saw Mulumba in the street and approached him. I already knew who he was because of the vision, but he had no idea I knew his identity. He looked at me and said, "The Holy Spirit dwells in you. Not all Christians have a light like you. Many do not have the Holy Spirit and do not know how important it is to have God in their lives. They do not live the gospel and believe they can overcome the powers of darkness, but they deceive themselves."<br><br>

        He continued, "I know everything that happens in the spiritual world. Evil spirits tell me about Christians who walk in the truth. With these, we must be careful, so they do not overcome us. The evil spirits also speak of false Christians who do not live what they preach; we are not afraid of them. The demons have already claimed the souls of these false Christians. I have killed several of them through black magic. When I was raptured to hell, I saw the false shepherds I killed in magic—they were mocked and ridiculed by demons."<br><br>

        Mulumba explained that when the werewolf spirit entered his body, he would run into the woods and lose consciousness, only to find himself in hellfire. He would then wake up in a hospital bed, rescued by someone who saw him fall. He admitted, "I know I belong to hell for all the evil I've done. I'm a demon in person. I do not feel sorry or compassion when I want to kill someone. I do not turn into a werewolf like in the movies; I am a possessed man. Since I was a child, I was addicted to werewolf movies and wanted to become one. That led me into witchcraft, letting my hair, nails, and beard grow. Through a ritual, a demon possessed my body and altered my hormones, causing hair to grow faster."<br><br>

        I told Mulumba to leave this path and turn to God, who forgives all sins. He replied, "I have made an everlasting covenant. I cannot leave this way. I know the power of your God and respect all true Christians. You who serve your God without falsehood and live the gospel—sorcerers have no power over you. Therefore, I will not fight against you. I acknowledge your God as the creator of the world. The demons I serve tremble before your God. They told me Jesus is coming back, and they are worried about those who live in holiness. I recognize the authority God gave you. When you were in the other city preaching the gospel, the demons told me everything you were doing and the loss of souls you caused. The chief sorcerer of Kalami, my greatest rival, could do nothing. You disarmed all sorcerers and left them defenseless. Now you are in my territory. My spells cannot reach you. I see a soldier dressed in the armor of the sky—nothing can penetrate it. Our war will be for souls. The people here fear me and want my powers. I can become invisible and disappear. In a poor country, many want superpowers; that is my advantage to preach the gospel of darkness. You preach your gospel, I preach mine. It's no use trying to convince me—I have already sold my soul to the devil." With those words, he vanished from my sight.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Death of the Sorcerer</p>

    

        <p>
        One night, I had a vision of a demon entering Paul Mulumba's room and touching his flesh. Cancer invaded his organs, and a few months later, he died of cancer. Leslie and Henry arrived from the United States to assist me in the mission in Pointe-Noire. Together, we contended with demons for souls and won many for Christ. We did not need to earn respect as the sorcerer claimed; Jesus earned the respect. We did not have to prove our authority—Jesus healed people in their homes when they prayed. We conquered with love, not fear. The word of God convinced and liberated souls.<br><br>

        My mission with Leslie and Henry ended in the Congo. I shared all the revelations I had in hell with the churches there. It was a seed I planted that will spread throughout the country. The Lord revealed to me that this would be my last experience, and that same year, He would take me to glory. I told Henry and Leslie, and they were saddened by this revelation. I also told my son Robert, but he did not accept it.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Rise of Sorcerers and the State of the Church</p>

        <p>
        The Lord showed me a vision of more sorcerers perfecting themselves, advancing in evil, and obeying Satan's standards to grow stronger. Meanwhile, Christians do not want to obey, pray, or fast for spiritual strength. Sorcerers lock themselves in coffins within graveyards, feeding on corpses and making great sacrifices for Satan. There is a difference between a disobedient Christian who pays no price and a Satan-obedient sorcerer who is given power. When these two confront each other, the obedient sorcerer receives all the ammunition of hell and takes advantage of the Christian who will not pray or obey. Prayer brings spiritual covering, and when we do not pray, we break Jesus' commandment to "pray without ceasing."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Path of the Cross</p>

        <p>
        The Lord showed me His way. I saw thorns and brothers walking over them, about to give up, their feet pierced and crying. Others, seeing the path, did not even try—they gave up before starting. Another group walked a path full of flowers, happy but unaware of the chasm of fire awaiting them at the end. I screamed for them not to take that path, but no one listened. The Lord told me they are spiritually deaf. These are people who have heard His word but have not believed and continue on the path of doom. His path is difficult, but those who walk it will reach eternal life and be crowned in His kingdom.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The State of the Churches</p>


        <p>
        In a vision, I saw the devil surrounding churches to disrupt their spiritual lives. Demons studied the qualities of each church to break their communion with Jesus, working hard to diminish the strength of their prayers. Other demons scattered brothers from holy denominations, causing them to follow other churches without commitment to Jesus. These spiritual brothers, if united, would bring revival, but the demons caused confusion, leading many to leave. As a result, the strongest left, leaving the weaker to work in the church. Demons entered many churches, sowing jealousy, misunderstanding, and arrogance, laughing when they could remove the most spiritual members.<br><br>

        A church that loses a valued worker is a victory for the demons. When they cannot overcome a united church, they first create division, then defeat the ministry. Many serious denominations closed due to internal tensions, as pastors could not resolve conflicts. Unity was lost, and disagreements were not forgiven. Jesus said the filth within churches must be cleansed so demons cannot work. The church must withstand the impacts caused by demons by forgiving, gathering, and organizing. A spiritually disorganized church reflects the conflicts among its members, caused by lack of vigilance. Jesus said, "My Holy Spirit does not dwell in strife. Do not let the devil break the bond of union that unites my people." When His servants quarrel, they break communion with the Holy Spirit, opening the way for demons to work. The Lord told me that older Christians are driving new converts away with hurtful words, and people in the church are being deceived by sin and lack of knowledge. Our desire must be to win souls.</p>


        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Soldiers of Christ</p>


        <p>
        I seek to train the skills God has given me and be a versatile soldier, overcoming sin and trials through prayer. We must be humble, know our faults, and draw closer to God so He can control our lives. The price we pay is to renounce the world and not let it influence us. Sacrificing the flesh and rejecting the world, the Lord Jesus gives credit to those who detach themselves from the sinful system. Our wealth is spiritual and found in Jesus. The more we value worldly things, the more we devalue spiritual and eternal things.<br><br>

        The purpose of doctrine is to foster union and love within the church, bringing the spiritual qualities God requires. This doctrine eliminates sin and helps spiritual and church life grow. Organize your spiritual life, change your ways, and pray for a victorious life. Practice the scriptures and persist in prayer. This hard work develops God's gifts, alters your spiritual life, and helps you grow in grace. To create a new man or woman, it is necessary to destroy the old self. Leave the world behind, and heaven will be in your favor.<br><br>

        Jesus is the basis of all success. He who practices His word completes His work, not sacrificing his life for something worthless, but for Jesus. Many Christians sacrifice the spirit to benefit the flesh. Be a soldier of God and live righteously. I never sold the gifts God gave me or coveted anything. I do everything for Jesus and the work of grace for the people. Every gift I received came with trials that prepared me to use these tools. When you ask for a gift, be prepared to take on that responsibility. For God, one soldier who fully trusts Him is worth more than a hundred trained Christians. He will give you credit when you make a difference on earth, and you will see His power at work in your life.<br><br>

        Soldiers arm themselves and go forward. Your potential is in Christ, and your ability is in Him. God multiplies your strength and anointing, causing you to produce more for His kingdom. But first, you must let go of the world, die to the flesh, and be born of the Spirit, like a seed that dies in the earth before it grows. In the world, the reverse happens—dying in the spirit and being born in the flesh, resulting in sinful desires and immorality. We must be different to win the world, not only living for God but helping others walk in truth, making them true disciples and efficient warriors.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The True Characteristics of Christ’s Soldiers</p>

        <ol>
            <li>They do not complain about hardships.</li><br>
            <li>They encourage those around them.</li><br>
            <li>They are silent about their trials, knowing only Jesus can resolve them.</li><br>
            <li>They do not do incomplete work for God.</li><br>
            <li>They win battles by trusting in Jesus, whose success is their secret of victory.</li><br>
            <li>They help others, forgive those who offend them, and are brave in spiritual warfare.</li><br>
            <li>They have the character of Jesus, follow sound doctrine, and never surrender easily.</li><br>
            <li>They evangelize as long as they live, defending the gospel of truth.</li><br>
            <li>They strive to keep sound doctrine and do not fear telling the truth.</li><br>
            <li>They devote their love to the work, overcome crises, and go against the tide of sin.</li><br>
            <li>They grow in grace without diminishing others, and the word is the beginning and end of their lives.</li><br>
            <li>They thank Jesus and those who help them, forgive, and respect their own bodies.</li><br>
            <li>They care for the needy, have vision and enthusiasm for the work, and live intensely with God.</li><br>
            <li>They are disciplined, control negative impulses, and do not let the flesh overcome them.</li><br>
            <li>They are loyal to Jesus, helpful, and make their lives part of God’s plans.</li><br>
            <li>Even when treated maliciously, they react with meekness, letting the Holy Spirit lead.</li><br>
            <li>They love the life God has given them, accept correction, and live in the present with serenity.</li><br>
        </ol>


        <p>
        Church, do not go to war discouraged, for faith will not endure and strength will fail because of discouragement. Before entering the war, seek courage in Jesus and strengthen yourself in His word. Know your weaknesses, be humble, and ask the Holy Spirit to cover them. That is all you need to enter spiritual warfare.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">False Prophets</p>


        <p>
        The Lord showed me a vision of the multiplication of false prophets. I saw Satan forming an army of false teachers. Demons used pastors to give counterfeit seminars, forming new heretics and teaching a false gospel. Legions of demons used these believers to spread deceit, mixing truth with lies. The pure word was tainted with heresies, and believers lost their identification with Jesus, opening churches to teach these errors. This false theology was infiltrating many seminaries.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">My Last Experience</p>


        <p>
        This is my last experience with Jesus, in March 2016. I want to say to all who hear my past experiences: I am leaving, but I believe the Lord will raise up men of God for His purposes in the end times. He raised up judges and prophets to replace those who had died, and I believe He will raise up a new group of Christians because His work cannot stop. His doctrine will not end at my grave.<br><br>

        I started a business at the beginning of my ministry to support my mission, not wanting to burden the church. The business in the United States is managed by someone who sends money to my mission. Life is such: a man is born and dies, and all he has conquered remains on earth. Only the works done for God follow him, as Revelation 14:13 says: "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord... their works do follow them."<br><br>

        I am very concerned about the church I will leave behind. Will they walk without me? I did not want to leave, not wanting to see my flock lost, but my days are ending, and the Lord will not allow me to stay. I am like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested. I express my joy at having done God’s will. This is my last mission and rapture; I will no longer travel to other countries. I will stay in New Zealand, where I have adapted to live, while Leslie and Henry are in the United States, where I left the headquarters of my ministry with Pastor Abraham, the vice president. Leslie and Henry will help the pastor continue the work I left. I am 71 years old and will die this year. The Lord has given me physical strength for His mission.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Closing Prayer</p>


        <p>
        All rejoice in Jesus, O church, for He has saved and redeemed you. Adore the Creator of your life. Applaud Jesus, for all honor and glory belong to Him. Blessed is the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world—bless Him with your whole heart. Sing and exhort Christ, who has delivered us from condemnation. Call unto the Lord, for He is our refuge.<br><br>

        Celebrate with jubilation to the Lord, all brothers, exalt with all your souls. He is the morning star who guides His people in the darkness of this world. Jesus is the flower that blooms in barren lands, the seed that germinates in the dry valley, the one who floats on the waters and calms the storm. He is the rock that pours water in the desert and quenches our thirst, the Prince of Heaven who has won all battles, and the Prince of Peace who enters the battle to fight for us.<br><br>

        Jesus is our fortress, the protector of our lives. The chariots of God are myriads, thousands upon thousands. Great upon the earth, He is glorified as the Lord of Armies, who created the earth for us to live. Glorify Him, for He is present in our midst. Cry to the Lord with all your soul, and He will come to touch the depths of your being. Seek Him with all your heart, and He will fill your interior with peace, joy, and happiness. He is essential in the life of the church. May the grace of the Lord abound in your lives. Amen.</p>
