kenzo atsushi in norway the year 2014 i took the plane and went to the city of oslo norway
when i arrived at the hotel i went to pray strife jesus showed me in a vision a church
full of gifts they used their tools for the edification and strengthening of the church at the same time they used their gifts
against their own brothers i saw swords in the hands of each brother they ward between them one
dueling the other with the sword jesus has revealed to me they use my word to attack each other your enemy is not the
flesh but satan the great enemy of god and his people many allow themselves to be manipulated
by the forces of darkness satan has declared a war against the church and the only means of defeating
my people is through their sinful actions winning souls to defeat satan it is necessary to live
a life of prayer and separate from the world the best way to attack satan is to live a righteous life before god only
the brave lives an obedient life by renouncing the world those who practice what is written in my
word cannot be defeated and cannot lose their territories besides the practitioners of truth enter
satan's territories to dominate taking control plundering the souls and bringing them to me
my servant this war between satan and the church what is at stake of the souls many pastors are not interested in
gaining souls but their financial interests while demons are not interested in financial interests but
winning souls through sex robberies trafficking and prostitution tell the gospel ministers to enter the
battlefield not to lose souls i cannot come down from heaven to do the work of the church nor can i command the angels
to win souls i have covenanted the church to win the world my people have to wage war for the lives
of others to free the world many christians are not living a holy life their souls are at stake too it is
not only the souls of the people of the world but these souls of christians also are not mine yet and the demons dispute
them tell the people of the church that are in sin to fight for their soul sanctifying and renouncing the world in
order not to lose their souls it is no use winning the world and losing your soul
in a war you do not win without preparation i am the captain and the general in this
war you are not alone i will direct and order what you are going to do and through my guidance we will invade the
territory of the enemy and take captive souls from the hands of satan every soul incarcerated in the field of
the devil will be freed from the spiritual bondage and the demons have to withdraw from their lives and surrender
every soul that was in their domain in another vision i saw people dying in slums prisons and elsewhere i saw no
evangelical in these places speaking of jesus these christians feared for their lives
speaking of jesus to dangerous people i do not understand christians being afraid to go to such places and rescue
people to live in heaven if they have hidden sins they are afraid of death and if they have their lives straight they
need not be afraid the death of a christian is his glory whoever dies for jesus has his reward i have already been
to heaven and those who are martyred to christ have a lot of rewards our death is not enough for all that
jesus did for us his death on the cross has paved the way for salvation to enter the territory of demons where
there are many traffickers bandits of the worst species it is not easy at all it has to be prepared spiritually and be
guided by the holy spirit to enter countries dominated by buddhism hinduism islam and other religions these
places are the worst places in the world to talk about jesus there are several classes of dangerous
people there are legions of devils working there these places of demonic territories
any men with their intelligence cannot escape the devil's traps if god is not with him these dangerous places are full of traps
of death where ruthless killers lurk for the blood of anyone who enters these places these killers have ties to all demonic
realms it is necessary to live a life of prayer and to be in holiness with god to enter
these places if the person dies he will be prepared to live in heaven otherwise god can give the liberation by
frustrating the traps of satan we do not overcome our spiritual enemy with our fleshly force or with human weapons but
with the strength of jesus with his spiritual weapons of heaven that he has given us to fight against the great army
of satan who was on earth in the air and in the sea i felt physically more vigorously after
i ate manna from heaven after i drank from that heavenly water my sorrows and afflictions that i felt
through persecution left me until the presence of god became stronger in my life i began to feel more peace and joy in my
life i'm feeling stronger spiritually after i've eaten that mystery scroll
i went to several churches to minister and when i speak in the pulpit i see in vision that out of my mouth came out
small balls of fire these balls of fire hit people's breasts and the flames entered their hearts
the people felt the presence of god and were renewed and glorified god those who are not freed fell into
demonic manifestations with only the words that come out of my mouth those balls of fire inflamed when i
touch these people i said be free and the demons leave at the same time
they brought me a blind woman she had gone to several churches i prayed for god to restore her vision
she saw again and glorified god the angel said that the scroll of mystery and hidden revelations would
strengthen my gift of prophecy rev 10 to 9 to 11 and i went on to the angel and said unto him give me the
little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in thy
mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me
thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and things i prophesied a brother's marriage
three months later he married i prophesied the restoration of the marriage of sister kimberly her husband
had left home a month after the prophecy he returns to his wife i prophesied to his sister that she
would receive a high sum of justice seven months later she won her cause of justice a drugged young man became one of my
ministrations i saw that the demons were preparing to take his soul the black contract of death was signed
i saw in the vision a hand ripping the contract of his sentence and this young man received a new opportunity
i saw people coming out of the stony dry valley of trials and god coming in with providence
listen to the story of a missionary i know god is in his life one day i prayed
to god i was very weak i felt a burden in my missionary journey when kenzo prayed for me the yoke was
gone i felt light all that weight disappeared and my sadness disappeared i
invited him to minister in my church when he went up in the pulpit i felt the presence of god so strong
it seemed that my being would disintegrate and when he touched my hand i felt the terrible anointing it seemed
that he was not made of flesh but a fire all that was in the pulpit my shepherd the elder and some brethren felt the
same electric current pass through their whole body his preaching was shocking he began to
speak and suddenly something took his mouth and his body taking control i could see that it was not him but the holy spirit
the pastor was out of the control of the ministry opening up legality for the holy spirit
a supernatural force took its place the result of his preaching his hidden revelations and his prophecies are real
shocking and fulfilled since that day that i saw him minister i began to seek the pastor's secret
because so much power in his words his words came so powerfully that many people in my church were taken by holy
spirit in just 10 minutes he shook my church after that night my church was never the same until today the people do
not stop to seek god many ministers who came to my church to preach had many letters in their
ministrations much knowledge much wisdom and understanding but pastor kenzo besides ministering wisely we love the
power of his words something wonderful i'm looking for jesus to reveal to me how i can minister
with power i kenzo i saw god has operated through my ministry where i go i see the holy
spirit acts he has poured fire on the church one day i was praying i saw a gigantic
ball of fire on top of the american continent this ball was standing waiting for an order to fall
i asked the lord what kind of fireball is this and why is it standing still
revival latin america jesus answered me this fireball is the revival that has not yet come to latin
america the prophets preach about the revival that will come but it will not come this fireball will continue to stand
still until these people humble themselves and reaping of their sins this revival will not come without
repentance and humility with each passing day their hearts harden and it became more and more difficult for the
revival to come many say that latin america as a whole will be sparked by having more christians than any part of the world
but they do not want a reaping of their sins i will pour forth my revival in some churches of the world only in those who
reap and of their sins and humble themselves the number of churches that humble themselves is few most are small
congregations i will not pour out my revival into a whole country not even every latin
american just as everyone says my revival has poured into the lives of those who repent and are willing to
humiliate themselves by renouncing the world for me types of prayer
i went to a church in oslo an extensive cathedral with few members i started to pray and my vision opened i
saw the prayers of those people who climbed on the ceiling and stopped there the holy spirit revealed to me that
these prayers are mechanical robotic automated without spirit and without a soul
a prayer from a religious person wanted to decorate the text and is spiritually dead i saw another kind of prayer rising
slowly these rose up into the air and disappeared into the sky the holy spirit revealed to me that this
prayer is in faith full of hope and trust but it was not perfect yet i saw another kind of prayer that came
up at high speed that rose in the form of a fireball the size of a tennis ball the holy spirit revealed to me that this
prayer is contrite a prayer with tears that come from the bottom of the soul this type of prayer always comes with an
answer since it is a sincere prayer born out of humiliation i saw another type of prayer from a
spiritual person it was done with strange tongues this prayer was a fireball the size of a
soccer ball and it rose in the sky at a speed it disappeared in the sky the holy spirit revealed to me that this
prayer in tongues is the strongest for the person who performs is in spirit his mind is detached from the world this
prayer overthrows the strongholds of the air that prevents it from rising i immediately had a vision a black mist
took over the air that dark mass grew an extension until it took the whole sky like a dark stain
that invaded the planet the darkness was covering the earth the holy spirit revealed to me the iniquity multiplies
and the forces of darkness in these ends of the time are multiplying on the earth the more the powers of darkness grow in
this world the more the church has to increase its prayers the one who prays twice a day has to
pray three the darkness will not cover the light for it will shine in the darkness the darkness cannot suffocate
the flame on ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden
neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the
house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify
your father which is in heaven matthew 5 14-16 the more iniquity increases because of
these powers this will require more holiness from the people revelation 22 11 whoever is unjust still
does injustice and whoever is dirty still defiles and whoever is righteous still does justice and whoever is holy
still sanctifies himself after these visions i returned to the hotel and god reminded me of my
adolescence i was helping my father build a house on top of ours i remember climbing up the wall that was
already built i got unbalanced and fell from six to seven feet off the ground
i felt a hand holding my back it seemed like i was falling in slow motion like a leaf of a tree
i fell to the ground but my fall was cushioned i told my father what happened he did not believe because he did not see the
incident he said that if i fell from that time i would have broken a bone and if i had hit my head i would have died
i did not understand what had happened today i understand why i did not die then
it is because of this work full of thorn where many are saving themselves when i remember the past i made a prayer of
thanks for the first time the same angel who walks with me in my raptures appeared to me and called me
i lay on the ground and closed my eyes he pulled my spirit out of the body this angel became a helper in my rapture

people who witness this testimony they need an evil vision to see the wicked at a long distance to prepare before the
bad knocks at their doors the wicked no matter how small it may be but he who has vision sees and neutralizes with the
power of your blood even small sin is evil and many do not see because of its size
the spiritual vision of god will not let his faithful servants fall into prisons even small sin is evil and harms our

with surprises lord open the spiritual vision of each brother who hears this testimony

brothers divided the church into parties or clubs of contention they were in hell repentant of the evil they caused in the
bosom of the church envy i saw envious christians in hell they
were envious because the brothers had a job who renumbered well had a car and a good house a good office in the church
these brothers were envious of everything and wish that these brothers did not succeed in their lives other
brothers in hell were envious that god used that brother more than himself they wanted to be used just like these
brothers but they did not live the word they did not seek god asking him to be used greatly they did not want to pay

credit his congregation no longer believed in his words satan used this christian to destroy the brother who

i saw christian heretics who practiced apostasies and heresies they were in hell
debtors i saw infidel believers and what they promised to god into men

i saw brothers in hell for deceiving their neighbor selling fragile goods at an expensive price lying that their
goods are good their merchandise was defective causing people to be harmed these brothers con people to earn their
living by lying proverbs 11 1-1 the false balance is an abomination to the
lord but the righteous wave is his delight presumptions i saw brethren in hell for being
presumptuous they were arrogant they wanted to be the owners of the truth they trusted in themselves they were
sure that they would do the work with their wisdom and strategies canceling the holy spirit taking the name of jesus
and putting their names their opinions in the church expressing their vanities of wise authorities went beyond their
limits let their egos grow all were wrong when they spoke of god only they were the owner of reason exposing their
excessive pride they died and are in hell no affection i saw believers and how because they had
no affection for their wives and children felt no affection for their families or for the brothers in the
church their hearts were hard and cold for souls they are in hell because they have no affection
one saved always saved error i was shocked by the number of believers in hell yet there are churches that
believe that when a soul is converted it is no longer at risk of losing salvation saved once forever saved i say if you do
not live a life according to the word you run the risk of losing your salvation this is a warning so that all may come
to renounce the world in order not to lose eternal life the nature of sin must die to be born a life for jesus
the angel took my hand and we rushed to earth on returning to my body i went to pray
europe the holy spirit revealed to me how the situation of the churches in norway is
i saw a spiritual coldness within each denomination of that country the spiritual ice is on all the churches of
europe they formerly had great men of god who helped to spread the gospel to the world
today europe looks like a valley of dry bones in need of revival the cause of its spiritual decline was the financial
industrial and technological development of europe comfort has made christians there to indulge in the commodity
europe needs to be shaken to that people will remember jesus europe must be brought to its knees before god
the holy spirit has revealed to me that it has a little harvest of souls in europe and that they need a spiritual
awakening jesus is returning europe has great theological knowledge but they are dead in the letters and
works their biblical understandings will not save but their intimacy with god knowledge is worth nothing without
communion with god it is necessary to have an action to seek god in spirit and truth god
requires a change in the attitude of europeans towards him europeans have to re-evangelize with the
power of god as they once did satan is taking advantage of this ease he knows their weaknesses and attacks
the weaknesses of europeans surprise attack the holy spirit has revealed to me that
satan is planning to launch a surprise attack on my sentimental life without me waiting for my strength to lose and if i
fall into this trap my spiritual recovery would take years for me to become a spiritual man again
i have to be watchful at all times it is not from now that god warns me i have to be careful these days
satan has already overthrown many men of god and continues to hunt spiritual men to overthrow i'm wanted he wants to see
my fall i have given a lot of work for the demons and preventing their evil plans they want to get me out of circulation
so i do not disrupt their plans if they can get me out of the way they will be free to deceive and gain many
souls for hell i was invited to minister in a church and the angel who accompanies me was on
my side and always helps me in my missions before ministering i prayed the holy
spirit revealed to me that i would make a supernatural experience to enliven that congregation
seven people fell on the ground i saw angels gathering their souls and rising to the ceiling and disappearing
30 minutes passed people who fell did not wake up they did not breathe they were without vital pulsation
the congregation began to panic because they did not know what was happening they wanted to call the ambulance to
take those people to the hospital the church was terrified that the people were dead i told you what was happening
and the holy spirit told me that there will be supernatural experiences with these people he asked me to tell the people to stay
calm that congregation had never had such experiences 12 people were taken away
after 30 minutes they woke up and rose from the ground four people went to hell alone and
returned from there terrified only three people went to hell and then to heaven look at the account of three people who
went to hell and then to heaven and jedha says i was raptured in hell i had always heard it it never crossed my
mind that one day i would pass through this place seeing how i was terrified it made me assert myself more and more with
god not to fall in that place i went to heaven and met sister berjita and brother elliot
we walked the same places among the angels eliot speaks i never believed in the
existence of hell i always criticized the brethren who preached this doctrine but now i saw
with my own eyes the existence of this place i saw more imprisoned in chains and within holes
it is sad to see people in one place which is to be of the devils i went to heaven and saw my friends and jedha and
birchda they were raptured at the same time i thought that before being snatched away that in heaven only lived god and
the angels i saw people there too berchta says i've always been terrified
of the dark going to hell was never my wish i saw devils of various species torturing people
the church needs to wake up the spiritual world is as real as this world we live
i went to heaven met and jedha and brother eliot it is a place that cannot be expressed
in words how beautiful and wonderful it is if the christians had seen this place that is their future homes they would
die for the gospel it is worth being martyrs for all this after the reports of these three people
in the church i returned home happy angel of purification pornography
i was invited to minister in another church the holy spirit revealed to me that there were people within pure eyes
in that place full of malice even being christians watching pornography on the internet i prayed and asked jesus to
touch those people's eyes and burn them all the evil i saw angels with their pincers touching the eyes of those
people purifying their eyes to give way to a holy look instead of a malicious glance
after these angels activities people felt their eyes burn in a vision i saw their eyes like a
flame of fire it was the purification that was happening i told the church everything that was happening there
a week later i went back to the same church and these people who were purified told their releases never again
did they watch pornography their eyes could not bear to look at a moral thing since that day
return home my mission ended in norway i returned to my country and arrived at my
home my son and my wife hugged me then we went for a walk on the return trip i went to my room to pray
satan's witchcraft i had a vision that the holy spirit revealed to me that satanists are active
at a glance i saw a man looking at a crystal ball and inside the ball appeared my house he managed to locate
my family this satanist lives in washington very far from my house the holy spirit revealed to me that he did
not know me but the demons took my name for this satanist to destroy me while i was in norway
the demons were already passing information from my house and my family to this satanist
this satanist has moved into my town and started casting spells sending legions of demons to attack my house
in a vision i saw demonic legion surrounding my house at night my wife and i started to hear
footsteps in our room my wife was scared when objects to fall to the ground
my son despite being young in adulthood looked like a child frightened by the noises and sounds of horses trotting in
our backyard i went to bathe in the bathroom mirror was dirty with letters of blood the letters were threatening me i do not
know how this happened what i can say is that this satanist is at a very advanced level in magic
a week later my son and my wife got sick i had to cancel my ministry to take care of both in my vision i saw the satanist
casting death spells in my house my wife and son went to the hospital they had tests doctors could not find
the cause of the illness i bowed my knees and prayed to god the holy spirit revealed to me that this
satanist sent a very strong spell to kill my family as they are both spiritually weak they were affected by
the inflamed arrows but they just did not die because of my prayers the satanist knew that he could not
reach me with his spells gave up attacking my house to cause me pain my wife and son were hit by not living a
life of intimacy with god but did not die because of the mercy of god i have always warned my son and my wife
to seek intimacy with god to pray more they only pray to sleep the state of the two was worse every day
i bowed my knees and interceded for the two i asked god not to take them from me now
after that prayer they began to recover when it was the next day they were fine
thank god and went to pray in my room i saw in a vision an angel with a sword in his hand wounding the satanist
he tried to hurt my family one week after this vision the satanist passed away the sight of him being wounded by
the angel was fulfilled the unsatisfied demons raised another satanist
in a vision i saw this man with a bunch of serpents doing enchantment the holy spirit told me to always look at the
ground one day i was going to church i was almost bitten by a snake and i managed to escape
the other day my yard was full of snakes my wife and son were afraid of being stung i was afraid they would come into
my house we tried to drive them away by fires in the yard but nothing worked i bent my
knees and started to pray the holy spirit revealed to me that they were possessed by devils so that these snakes
traveled long distances to reach my address they came from a city far to my house a ritual of possession was made in them
to sting me in my house i said a prayer of rebuke to those devils who were in those snakes
at the time they started coming out of my yard i end this testimony by praying a revival prayer for churches that are
cold in this world lord jesus at that moment i ask you to pour out your power and your anointing
filling us with your heavenly fire that comes straight from god this fire is not natural
it is supernatural and it does not go out this fire is going away from those who do not seek it this fire was in the
burning bush and did not fade it is this fire that descends in the church and sets fire to its people holy and
spiritual fire that comes from heaven to revive its people raise a flame in the soul of these people to seek their face feeds their
souls with their live amber increase the temperature with each life let this fire shape the interior and
melt the heart heart like candle wax his holy spirit is a hidden flame within us that is activated and ignites when we
cry out to jesus its supernatural heat produces a fire that burns our sin a flame that spreads
throughout the body purifying and producing holiness lord revive your church descend the
revival on your chosen ones i thank you for listening to me and i deliver these denominations into your
hands in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit
