        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Return to Mexico and the Proposal</p>

I was praying to God the
Lord Jesus told me my servant I want to
pour out my anointing but I need a
renewal and Revival from my church to
multiply my wonders I want to make my
people a force against evil The Works of
the flesh do not change anything good in
their lives because the works of the
flesh are sins
The Works of my spirit transforms and
leads to my glory the appearance and
importance in society are worth nothing
to me many seek positions and status I
care about their salvation tell them to
seek the spiritual appearance that will
leave my image and likeness in them
that's what matters to me whatever
pleases the world does not please me I
do not want the world to see my servants
by status but to see my light in their
lives the devil's agents have sacrificed
lives to destroy mankind I want my
people to advance and invade those evil
territories which keeps the people
captive I empowered my church to give
them spiritual weapons so they could
March many did not recognize the weapons
they had fear would not let them go on
tell my people to give up the fashion of
this world they have to be different
from the world and be equal to me My
Bride is a part of me are linked through
my
blood just as a man and a woman give in
marriage and become one I am United to
my church and together we became one
from adamk rib left Eve he fell asleep
so that Eve was created from my rib left
the church when I died on the cross of
Calvary I felt birth pains for the birth
of my people I want spiritual unity and
that my people give continuity to the
work of the Apostles I want a United
Church my Apostles built the church and
who will raise the last bricks of that
building are you I do not want pastors
to seek membership I do not care for
crowds tell them to make a holy church
so I can come and get them I passed all
these Revelations to the churches
wherever I went Revival the Lord Jesus
showed me in the vision another church
that prayed for Revival the demons
fought against this church putting
obstacles not to receive the Revival the
demons placed barriers in their
relationships and financial lives to
divert their attention from the Revival
and to be concerned about their
problems they began to go through great
trials in their homes and did not go to
the Revival prayer in the church they
were stuck in their difficulties all
stopped praying and chilled they were
not prepared to receive power from
heaven and spiritual
anointings conjugal and family barriers
coupled with financial situations
prevented them from approaching God more
and conquering their
victories they failed to perform the
Revival they sought their desires were
blocked by trials the demons were able
to impose difficulties and they did not
win the Lord Jesus told me if they had
not given up I would have taken some of
the Brethren and Empower all those
people the Lord Jesus showed me another
church which was Waging War against the
legions of demons the people of this
church were a spiritual family united
and were connected in the vine that is
the Lord Jesus edified in the truth they
were not a family of blood but a
spiritual family whose blood that bound
them was the blood of the Lord
Jesus the weapons of attack of this
church are evangelism they entered the
territories of the demons and attacked
with the word and prayer in the homes of
the people they were Vigilant toward God
and inspired by the Holy Spirit and
determined to walk on the thorny path of
the Lord Jesus and to remain until the
end they did not give up with adversity
they did not stop fighting for Souls
they had great leadership and Great Soul
winners the demons tried to stop and
destabilize these warriors with the evil
obstacles but they surpassed and
overcame them this little army formed
was prepared to destroy the evil
fortresses of the Earth the Holy Spirit
gave authority to this little church to
put the demons at their feet with their
Authority they expelled the demons and
sent them out their firearms came from
God they lived praying renounced the
world to break the evil law practicing
Holiness and determined to follow the
lord Jesus to the end they have great
resistance to the pressures of the
demons and endured the
trials cage churches the Lord Jesus said
to me in a spiritual war those who are
not armed with the spiritual weapons of
God will be dominated by sin and
enslaved by demons they imprison
churches in spiritual chains many
Christians are captive the Lord Jesus
showed me in the vision the Devils
enslavement of churches they were
chained by sin all were prisoners of the
legions the demons imprisoned whole
churches in a great black cage I saw
other churches where the demons walked
within their Hall they did not fear the
Christians there and they walked freely
they did not disturb the demons they did
not frighten themselves the Lord Jesus
showed me that this church is weak
unequipped in Spiritual armor to combat
evil the Lord Jesus told me today's
churches have large numbers of
Christians but they do not have the
spiritual conditions to fight the world
for two reasons they have not renounced
the world they are still connected with
pleasures and are weakened in
sin the other reason is that they do not
like to pray which makes it difficult
for their spiritual eyes to be opened
without prayer they have no Authority
against evil without prayer they become
cold their hearts are filled with carnal
desires they become discouraged they
cannot dominate their flesh without
prayer and Holiness they lose the
strategies of vanquishing the
Demons the church that does not pray is
cold they have no gifts of the holy
spirit its spiritual vision does not
open the people are distant from me
cannot overcome the Flesh and are
believers filled with strife the legions
fear a church clothed with power that
praise humbles before me and is my will
churches that think they are
self-sufficient do not seek my face are
easy targets for
demons the Lord Jesus showed me another
church they did not bother with sin they
prostrated themselves before the world
sin had conquered that
people this Christian Army is without
War General that is the holy spirit that
has moved away these Warriors no longer
had spiritual ears they lost the
sensitiv of hearing the voice of God the
Holy Spirit even removed from that
people warned of the evil and danger of
Satan but sin had deafened and blinded
that
people the Lord Jesus showed me the
spiritual situation of that church their
hands were all Chained and the demons
held those chains and dragged them to
the abyss they lacked the strength to
fight back the sin in their lives had
weakened and taken away their
strength the Lord Jesus showed me a
church with about 500 members and
revealed their spiritual reality
all this Army were unarmed their hands
were naked and had not the sword of the
spirit the demons were not frightened of
this church in another Vision I saw
demons wanting to undermine the forces
of true Christians Satan Was preparing
their last attacks against the churches
their targets were those who are
committed to the truth and live the
word Satan planned to use some of these
churches to provoke a rebellion against
sound Doctrine and in favor of modern
doctrinal reform and liberalism
Satan invests his WS to divide the
people of the Holy churches to divide
the body of Christ causing Rebellion
against
truth these groups that Rebel left the
church and draw a crowd away with them
to open temples and impose their carnal
doctrines and free of compromises with
the truth according to their vain
Hearts fall of a man of God money I am
going to report the fall of a Christian
of the ministerial Church followers of
the faith this church is near my
residence I have already had the
pleasure to minister there and to know
that great man of God who had gone
astray before the fall of this
evangelist the Lord Jesus showed me
Satan sat at the table with three Chief
demons setting up a plan to overthrow
this man of God he was very applied in
communion with God all this caught the
attention of the demons and bothered
them this man did everything that the
word of God commands he had a great
spiritual performance in the word prayed
hard and gave his best to God in the
work
his spiritual life was stabilized
nothing weakened him and overthrew him
he overcame his family trials and
maintained a spiritual level without
letting down his
anointing he recognized that he needed
the Holy Spirit and had a bond of
spiritual Affinity with him his
friendship was kneee and he was not
influenced by false
prophets he was a disciplined man and
indoctrinated by the word who lived what
everyone has trouble
practicing his pastor's church was full
of people because because of him the
church survived and did not close the
doors because of his ministry that built
the
people this Christian was trained in
sound Doctrine a quality worker a man of
initiation to do the work willing to pay
the price for the gospel a practitioner
of Good Works a man responsible for the
work with a great biblical
knowledge the Lord Jesus gave him the
spiritual capacity to do the work this
man was spiritually Rich motivated by
the word his cheerful expression was not
defeated even with what little he had
even though he was wounded by the
persecutions of many Christians he would
not open his mouth to argue with them he
would not be overwhelmed by the
oppression of his church Brothers he
would walk upright and smile on his face
he endured the criticism he was not
shaken he was not involved in debates
and discussions he gave all this to God
his Pastor charged him in the work he
bored that the charge is for his growth
in the work of God knew that the pastor
wanted the best for him him he was
determined to win souls the word to give
up the work did not exist in his
vocabulary zealous of the work that God
put in his
hands he was a man who took the work of
God seriously did not murmur when
business did not go well prayed
constantly even though he did not have
God's answer he was convinced that God
was listening to his prayer and that he
kept his prayers in Golden goblets in
heaven and even though he was in great
trials in his home out of money and out
of work he knew that the Lord Jesus
never forsook him his purpose was the
kingdom of God a great soldier of the
persistent Heaven did not care about
offices and influenced many Brethren to
resist sin and
trials he was a spiritual Warrior a man
who did not only like to acquire
knowledge but he loved biblical practice
a theory he did not serve the word of
God had to be transformed into action
lived and practiced that he did
perfectly he was participatory and very
active in the work was aware that God
had sent an angel to protect him and
give him Security even without seeing
this Angel his faith knew that he was by
his side he saw by faith had courage and
attitude in the work worked with
satisfaction worker qualified by God fit
for good work his ability came from God
he was a man trained by the Holy
Spirit his work had efficacy It produced
the effects desired by God it pleased
the gentleman in every way an efficient
man and everything that he did for God
his example of Behaving made everyone
want to emulate him he had mental
self-control he did not lose his temper
with insults and adverse situations he
kept himself calm and Serene he accepted
correction to improve his behavior he
evaluated himself and examined himself
to see if his spiritual performance
increased he was submissive to God and
His Pastor did not let his ego grow nor
did he want to be greater than anyone
else even even though being unemployed
he was faithful one day a church sent an
invitation to his wife she was happy and
gave the invitation to her husband he
went to his Pastor to ask permission to
minister in this church when he finished
his ministry the pastor who invited him
offered
$4,000 he did not want to accept his
wife told him to accept because he did
not have a job he accepted the money
because of his wife that same church
sent the invitation a second time
offered him money he did not want to
accept it the pastor insisted that he
take it and told him to think about his
children the church sent the third
invitation he did not want to go as he
did not want to receive any money his
wife said he had no choice he would have
to accept for the sake of his
family through this church he became
well known in the region and began to
minister in several churches his
ministrations cost
$10,000 this evangelist no longer had
time to help his Pastor his schedule was
was full and began to lose the pleasure
of serving God out of love he no longer
prayed in the vision of Satan and the
three Chief demons I saw they were
celebrating the fall of this evangelist
their plan to convince the evangelist's
wife to make him become a mercenary of
the Kingdom a seller of the Gospel had
come
true Satan said I used the shepherd to
offer him money he planted the root of
greed in his heart the demons laughed
for having made the Evangelist a
mercenary of the faith
months later he left the church the
living flame of the Holy Spirit went out
he became an alcoholic beat his wife and
even committed infidelities with other
women his wife was praying in the church
where her husband was congregating
asking God to bring him back that
soldier who had nothing of material
wealth had only spiritual riches now he
had money but he had lost his spiritual
wealth which is his
virtue he gave everything his wife
wanted through money but also brought
great suffering to his wife who now
preferred her old life humble and
happy cancer after these Revelations I
felt strong pains in the belly I knew
that the cancer was getting worse I
prayed to God saying I cannot die this
way I did not fulfill my mission I have
many souls to win a man came to my door
and said I do not know you I am a
servant of God he sent me here to tell
you this servant today I pluck your
cancer qu the man went away I lay down
in bed in pain an angel of God appeared
to me I only remember that my sights
darkened and I fell into a deep
sleep when I woke up I was not feeling
any more pain when I lifted my shirt I
saw a small mark on my belly it looked
like a scalpel cut an angel appeared to
me and said I stripped your cancer While
You Were Sleeping that little Mark one
left is the proof of the miracle I went
to the doctor to make new tests he did
not find anything and said cancer that
was in my stomach has disappeared
leaving no
Scar the doctor said how can that happen
cancer is treated with chemotherapy
killing it from the inside cancer is not
pulled out of the body in this way
someone did a little cut in your belly
and he took off cancer how is it
possible who was the genius doctor who
performed this miracle I answered I do
not know when I woke up I already had
that Mark the Lord Jesus healed me
doctor I returned home thank thanking
God for this miracle I bent my knee and
went to pray the next day I went to a
church the Lord Jesus showed me in a
vision a Godly girl who was firm and
walked in
righteousness the Youth of the church
bullied her and called her strange the
demons threw evil darts into her heart
leaving her with the Wrath and sorrow of
many in the church every day she was
isolated and separated from the rest of
the
youth I prayed and rebuked those Devils
who attacked that young woman at the end
of the service I prayed and I saw a
breastplate coming down from the sky and
covering her
chest the Holy Spirit revealed to me and
said today my servant is seen with the
breastplate of Justice no evil Dart will
enter her heart she is protected tell
her that I have wiped her heart and she
will not have hurt nor hold a grudge of
these people today I purify her heart I
approached this girl past the vision and
the revelation of the Holy Spirit she
was happy and approached all who
persecuted her treating them well
false religions Upon returning home I
had a vision of Satan and his demons
creating new
religions Satan said the greater the
number of religions the more the human
race will be confused they will not see
the way of Truth which will be like a
small needle in the hastac they will be
so confused by so many ways that they
will not know which religion is right
they will be so lost without knowing the
way to walk and many will prefer to
follow any religion because they do not
know the right and walked in their own
ways that will lead to death we will
make their minds that all religions are
of God and thus we will gain their souls
we will continue multiplying false
churches and sects in the earth we have
little time we will carry the largest
number of souls with us false churches
let's create several Evangelical
churches with their adulterated
doctrines use our ministers to teach a
modified gospel and they will never know
that they are straying from the true
gospel and thus gain their souls our
struggle is to win the largest number of
Christians those in the world are
already ours Satan struck the table in
the middle of the meeting and said we
have a problem the conservative churches
that have not yet modernized can exist
another hundred years without changing
and innovating their doctrines these
churches have few Souls that we have
conquered some conservative churches
have opened for modernization we are
already gaining Souls there the minority
of churches have struggled against our
modernization we will Press On they
cannot resist we will exhaust them and
draw their members to go and congregate
in modern
churches when these conservative pastors
lose their membership they will have no
other choice but to succumb to modernity
otherwise their churches have to close
their
doors witchcraft sorcerer I traveled to
the city of dong which is in the country
of Togo Africa when I arrived I rented a
house to stay a month in that place
doing the
mission at dusk I had a vision of a
witch was invisible and passed through
the walls she could enter the houses
frighten people and often discover
valuables and then steal she knew where
the Village People guarded the money in
their
homes it left me with no explanation how
a person could have so much evil force
to be
invisible Days Later doing the mission I
met a woman that I saw in my vision in
the center of the city she was in the
crowd as I approached she had a strange
reaction to my respect she stood in the
middle of the crowd crowd and she was
frightened walking backward in the midst
of that crowd I bothered her now I
understand why the light does not match
the darkness she left my presence and
fled from me Satan does not want to see
me come close to her workers so that
through my life this poor soul and slave
will be
released I returned home did not
understand the strange reaction of this
woman I went to pray and in the vision
the Lord Jesus showed me why she ran
away from me in the vision I was in the
form of fire this witch felt the
temperature and began to move away and
fled because of the fire that emanated
from me because it burned all the evil
that was in her life after that Vision I
went to bed I had a vision This Witch
was approaching my house I got up and
went to pray I asked the Lord Jesus to
cover my house with his blood just as he
did to the houses of the Jews with the
blood of the Lamb so that the angel of
death does not kill she approached and
tried to enter my house but the Lord
Jesus blood covered my house preventing
her from
entering the Holy Spirit revealed me I
have work in her life when I heard these
words I prayed to the Lord Jesus and
asked him to remove the spiritual
covering the witch got inside my house
trying to scare me she said she was a
demon I saidou not a ghost let alone a
demon you're just like me the angel of
the Lord who helps me in the raptures
went down there with the Sword of Fire
and arrested that woman who tried to do
me wrong she could see the angel and she
was scared because she could not move
she was
trapped I told her calm down the angel
will not hurt you if you were a demon he
would slice you with his sword of
fire the angel released the woman I said
to her I have authority from God I can
arrest and release you I prayed for the
Lord Jesus to cover my house with his
blood not to let you go she was trying
to get past the wall to escape but the
spiritual covering of the blood of the
Lord Jesus prevented her from running
away she said how did your wizard do it
I cannot get out of here you will do me
wrong I said I do not hurt only good
before you appear here the Lord Jesus
showed me in the vision you scare people
by being a ghost and steal objects from
the houses you came here but I have no
valuables or riches here how do you
become invisible if you were flesh she
replied I Am Not Invisible my body is
out there only my spirit that walks into
houses
I have gained powers of the Demons to
appear to people The Same Spirit Rapture
that Christians have we witchcraft are
also snatched to Fathom the territories
the demons take our spirit to work for
them I go inside the houses to see what
valuables people have then I plunder my
body is lying near your house next to
your gate when I heard this report I ran
to her body that was lying on the ground
I prayed over her and her spirit
returned to her body I lifted her off
the ground she told me evil spirit
spirits who gave me these spiritual
abilities sent me here to kill you not
to steal anything I will be gone for the
evil spirits are coming to rescue me I
can feel their presence from afar I said
you cannot go you failed the mission to
kill me letun get out of the yard and
come to my house the witch accompanied
me and we entered the house and closed
the door I prayed to God for his
spiritual covering on that house the
witch said please let me go otherwise
you're going to die today
I saw in the vision on the other side of
the penous a legion of demons flying
around the house and upstairs everywhere
were surrounded by
demons the Furious demons could not get
through the penous to get in they wanted
to kill me the principality of that
place said Kenzo release our servant she
is our witchcraft Sorcerer of the region
you do your work and let our servant do
our mission release her or you will be
declaring the greatest war of your life
she is valuable able to our plans the
Lord Jesus gave me a spiritual hearing I
could hear their voices and I answered
them that Soul no longer belongs to you
she will be converted into a new person
that you have
lost the Sorceress was afraid of threats
and wanted to open the door to
leave the Holy Spirit revealed to me
that there was a demon in the body of
Witchcraft wanting to come out he also
revealed to me that the demons would
kill the Sorceress I laid my hands on
her head and the demon manifested I did
not expel him because of the covering of
the Lord Jesus blood that kept him from
leaving my house the spirits from
outside could not enter nor could the
spirits inside leave my
house things began to get complicated I
and the Sorceress could not go out and
be torn apart by the demons we were
surrounded the angel who helps me down
into my house he was the only one who
managed to get through the
penous when he came down to help me I
cast out the demon from the Sorceress
but that demon was trapped in my house
and could not get through the
cover the angel took that demon and went
over the cover taking me out of my
residence but the Legion of demons
attacked the auxiliary Angel and they
arrested him in the giant
cage I saw a glow that was on the
ceiling it was the very bright glow that
came from the sky the Archangel Michael
came down with his sword that Shone like
a light and attacked that Legion
releasing my auxiliary
Angel the two made that Legion of demon
flee and those two angels ascended to
Heaven I prayed for the Sorceress she
was free it was already Dawn see her
account my name is marle Courtney and I
may say that God has given great
authority to this pastor to make that
spiritual covering by blocking the
entrance to the
demons I had a mission to kill the
pastor if I fail I would lose my skills
and be struck dead for the demons knew
that the pastor would fight for my
conversion thank God he did not let me
leave on that turbulent night I knew I
would die if I went outside I did not
say anything to the pastor about the
death plan that was armed for me the
Holy Spirit revealed the death trap to
the shepherd today I am free and serve
God I am Pastor Kenzo I fought the
greatest spiritual battle that night it
was one of the greatest in my life if I
did not have life on the altar that
sister mariss would have killed me or
that Legion of demons would have come
into my house and killed me and sister
mariss
