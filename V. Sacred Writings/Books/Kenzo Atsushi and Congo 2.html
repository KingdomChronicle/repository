        <p>Kenzo Atsushi and Congo 2</p>
        

        <!-------------------------------START OF LESSON 1  ------------------------------->
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Kenzo’s Journey to Congo</p>


        <p>
        The day of my trip arrived. I took my bags and went to the airport to catch the plane to the Congo. I arrived in the African country called Congo, in the town of Kalami. I went straight to the village, but I ended up getting lost in the middle of the road. I felt tired and hungry while walking. I also felt a headache and seasickness; my eyes were getting dark. Then, I saw a being in white approaching, and I fainted. <br><br>

        When I woke up, I was lying on a hospital bed. A man said he had brought me to the hospital, then he left. The doctor entered my room, and I asked, "What city is this?" The doctor said, "This is the capital, Kinshasa." I thought to myself, this man of God brought me from a village far away to the capital. It would take a plane or helicopter to reach the capital, yet he arrived very fast.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Angelic Rescue</p>

        <p>
        I was in the small town of Kalami. I got up from my hospital bed and went to the reception. I asked the girl who was the boy who brought me and what his name was. She replied, "No boy has brought you; you are without any companion." I thought to myself, that man in white who appeared to me when I fainted can only be the angel of the Lord.<br><br>

        He took me in his arms and brought me to the hospital. He must have moved supernaturally. I was in a place far from the village; no one was there with me. If it had not been for the angel to save my life, I would have starved to death or been eaten by a wild animal. Who was the human being who could find me in such a difficult place and take me to a hospital so fast? No car could reach a place forgotten by the world without a landing place, lost in the middle of small trees. There is no airplane landing in that place where there is a forest. The small town of Kalami is 2,242 kilometers from Kinshasa. It would take 36 hours by car to reach the capital.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Vision of Demonic Principalities</p>

        <p>
        I was tired, so I rented a hotel in the capital. Upon my arrival, I prayed to God, and in a vision, I saw the principality of war—a giant demon that incites war all over the world. I saw deaf demons and mute demons possessing people in Congo. I saw demon frogs coming out of lakes and rivers, possessing people. The Holy Spirit revealed to me that many in this country are deaf and dumb because of demons. I saw devils coming out of the sea and possessing people on earth.<br><br>

        When I received this vision, I went to a church in the city, guided by the Holy Spirit. When I entered, no one knew me, but the pastor gave me the opportunity to minister without knowing me. I believe it was the Holy Spirit who touched his heart to let me minister.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Spiritual Warfare Among Churches</p>

        <p>
        I saw many wars in the churches because of souls. The shepherds waged war for the souls; one attacked the other and denigrated the other’s church just to get all the souls of that place. I saw one pastor making opposing prayers to destroy another’s church. When one church closed, the other pastors were happy and celebrated the failure of the other.<br><br>

        The Lord revealed to me that ambition for money is a big dispute. The Lord showed me in a vision demons laughing at those shepherds who celebrated the closures of churches.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Encounter with a Sorceress</p>

        <p>
        I went to the street to buy some food for lunch. I went into a small food market. The owner approached me and asked, "What’s your name?" I said, "My name is Kenzo." When she approached me, I felt a strong evil presence.<br><br>

        She said, "My name is Akilah. A month ago, I saw a flame of fire walking towards this place. That torch was in human form. This city is given to darkness. This human torch-like person I saw entering the place illuminated the dark and black city that is taken by the force of evil. No Christian enters this place because of the weight of the negativity of darkness. You are that human torch who entered this place. You’re very brave to come here. I want to tell you that you’re not welcome here. You’re our enemy. I’m a sorceress. I have 15 houses, three places, four new cars, and a large amount of money in the bank. Today I can tell you that I am a financially accomplished person. Satan gave me everything in exchange for the pact I made with him."

        I looked at her and said, "You are being deceived by him," and I left.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Sorceress’s Death</p>

        <p>
        Months later, the Lord showed me in a vision a black demon entering the house of this sorceress. He pointed his finger at her, and from his hand came out an evil dart that hit her mind. She fell to the ground dead. The Lord said, "This woman has worked for Satan all her life. She has had everything she asked for and conquered many goods on earth. Now it is time for Satan to seek her soul. She has sold her soul to the devil. Her conquests on earth ended; he came to get his soul."<br><br>

        The next day, I went early to the market to talk to the owner of Akilah’s market. One of her employees told me she died last night, fallen on the ground just like in my vision. She died at the same time I was having the vision.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Warning from the Locals</p>

        <p>
        On leaving the market, a gentleman stopped me on the street and said, "Demons do not want you here. Get out of our city. It’s a curse on our plans and purposes. You came to bring light to a city plunged into the underworld of darkness."<br><br>

        That man, while threatening me, was gone. Now I knew the demons did not want anyone in this place and were warning all their agents.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Visions of Spiritual War</p>

        <p>
        I went to my house and had another vision. I rented a small house in the village to spend my mission there. In the vision, I saw a great war of wizards against the church. The churches were being bombarded with spells to weaken the town and close the doors of the churches.<br><br>

        The Lord showed me another vision: when I was coming to this country, the demons left where I lived and went to this country to warn that I was going to do a mission there. In the vision, I saw the demons where I live passing information about my life to the demons of that country who did not know me. These territorial demons organized and formed a diabolical army to protect their lands.<br><br>

        After these visions, I understood the desperation of the sorcerer in that place.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Ministry and Prayer</p>

        <p>
        The night I went to a church near my house, before beginning to tell the testimony about what the Holy Spirit had revealed to me about the people of God, I said a prayer:<br><br>

        "Lord Jesus, deliver your people from the customs of the world that are entering the churches. They do not know that it is the work of Satan. These evil customs are weakening your church. They do not understand that the Lord abhors vanity. Sin enters their lives without anyone noticing and kills the Lord’s church. May the Lord, my God, awaken these people who do not watch. The Holy Spirit has turned away from sin, impurity, and all the dirt that is on the altar. The church has grown in quantity of people but has fallen in spirituality. The supernatural works of God have not happened. I see a church fallen and defeated by Satan. The devil has operated in taking possession, fulfilling their evil plans. Their evil plans are at work among the spiritually dead churches. They do not obey your word, break the new covenant, and do what the word condemns. Have mercy, Lord, on your people. Raise them up. Do not let them prostrate themselves before sin. Renew the covenant and make a new covenant with your people. Work again your signs. Cast out all evil in the midst of your congregation."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Deliverance and Miracles</p>

        <p>
        I went to the church. Before I began the ministry, I prayed. I saw many people fall into demonic attacks. I saw deaf people fall into demonic manifestations. I cast out devils, and people began to hear. I saw demonized people fall into demonic manifestations. I expelled demons, and people started speaking. A paralytic in a wheelchair began to scream; he was demon-possessed. I cast out the demon. The man got up from the wheelchair, glorifying God.<br><br>

        My vision inside the church opened, and I saw large black scales falling from the eyes of many brethren. I saw their spiritual visions opening up. I saw angels from heaven descending on that place, touching the heads of each brother. The Holy Spirit revealed to me that God was giving the sound of understanding and wisdom to some brethren.<br><br>

        At the end of the ministry, I saw the brothers coming out renewed.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Corruption in Churches</p>

        <p>
        I went home to bend my knee. My spiritual vision opened and went further. My vision penetrated several churches, temples, and cathedrals of Congo. I saw in the pulpits and altars much witchcraft. The shepherds performed rituals of witchcraft on the altars of the churches for their gods.<br><br>

        I had another vision, this time my vision was of the four corners of the world from the earth globe. The Holy Spirit revealed to me that many pastors are freemasons, sorcerers, and satanists, opening churches everywhere in the world. All their churches are full of people for the ease of the gospel without renunciation that they preach.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Angel of Light</p>

        <p>
        The next day, a person knocked on my door. I opened it. The man introduced himself as an angel of God. I saw how that man turned into an angel with huge wings. His white color glowed. He said, "I’m going to do the next mission with you."<br><br>

        I said to him, "As you go with me, I did not ask God for any help, and even if I did, the Holy Spirit would reveal to me when God is going to send a helper."<br><br>

        The angel said, "You did not pray for this mission today; that is why it was not revealed. Our God knows very well our needs. He knows when the man needs help. You do not remember when you were in the village and got lost, you did not ask for an angel, but even so, our Father sent me to save you. He knows when we need help, and that’s why the Lord sent me."<br><br>

        I said to the angel, "I go to the village where I got lost the first time in two days."<br><br>

        The angel said, "Two days hence, find me in the center of the city. I will go with thee," and the angel departed.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Leslie’s Message and Arrival</p>

        <p>
        Leslie sent a message to my cell phone from the United States. He said he had a dream with me. He saw me carrying the cross, and he helped me carry this cross. We both shared the weight; each one carried the cross a little. Leslie said he will help me in this mission. He said that next week he is coming to Congo to help me. He will bring six more brothers from the church where I am the pastor to go with him.<br><br>

        Two days from now, I’m going to travel and wait for them in the village.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Meeting the Angel and Preparing for the Mission</p>

        <p>
        Two days passed. I went to the center of the city to meet the angel. He was in the form of a man. I said to the angel, "Let’s go buy a car to the village. When I arrive in the village, I’ll tell you what the mission is going to be like."<br><br>

        That man turned into an angel. He was walking on foot to reach the village. The angel said, "It is very dangerous. They will kill you. Do not preach the gospel until you convince them that it is good. Earn their trust."<br><br>

        I said, "I will enter with a prayer of deliverance, not to let the demons manipulate them against me."<br><br>

        The angel said, "It will frighten them if you make the liberation. It is better to arrive like a tourist."<br><br>

        I said to the angel, "Are you the head of the mission or my helper? The other angel who went with me in Syria was my helper. The Lord does not want to help me; He wants to say how my mission will be."<br><br>

        The other angel agreed with me. The Lord is not willing to agree. I did not ask God to send a helper. The Holy Spirit did not tell me that an angel would come. I know what to do on this mission. I only do what the Holy Spirit told me before I came here. I prayed before I came, asking for strategy.<br><br>

        Angel, I cannot feel your presence like that of the other angels who came to me. Although you shine like other angels, you came as a man. I did not feel your angelic presence, and now transformed into an angel, I cannot feel your presence because it is neutralizing this energy of your body so that I do not feel.<br><br>

        The angel gave a moan trying to resist. I said, "Demon, finish the disguise. I felt your evil presence. When I rebuked you, get lost. It’s over for you."<br><br>

        That white angel began to turn black, and that glow darkened. He turned on a bat of wings and disappeared. When I called out the name of Jesus, giving him orders to reveal himself, he tried to resist. He made a huge effort not to reveal his identity. As he gave a small moan trying to hide his evil presence, I could feel his demonic presence lightly. Discovering his identity, he had no choice but to reveal himself.<br><br>

        I’ve had several experiences in deliverance. Demons have already appeared to me, and I’ve been to hell. I know what an evil presence is. If I did not have the gift of discernment of spirit, I would never have captured that very weak presence of that demon. He wanted to disrupt the mission that God gave me. He wanted to direct me what to do. He never agreed with me. Everything I do is directed by the Holy Spirit. Who does not agree is not in the same purpose as God. </p>

        <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Arrival in the Village</p>

        <p>
        Finally, I arrived in the village. I saw many poor people there. I introduced myself and began to talk about Jesus, about salvation, and all the miracles He performed. The patriarch of the wooden house where I stayed was almost 100 years old. He had recently lost a family member. A great-great-grandmother said, "You talk so much about this Jesus. My uncle died two days ago. So far, no sorcerer has been able to bring him to life. None of his gods have succeeded, not even the chief sorcerer. And you tell me Jesus brings life?"<br><br>

        She challenged me: "If this Jesus came to bring life, prove it now. If you do, my family and everyone here will accept your Jesus." The patriarch's great-grandfather had his uncle's body brought to me. The corpse had been wrapped in cloth for two days, still unburied, as they waited for a miracle. The patriarch's great-grandfather said I would be the last to try to revive his uncle. If I failed, he would be buried.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Test of Faith</p>

        <p>
        I replied, "I cannot do this. Only Jesus has the key to death; only He can give life. I do not determine anything—only Jesus does. The Word says that man is destined to die once, then comes judgment. If he died, it was because his time had come." The great-grandson of the patriarch scoffed, "Then your God is a farce." I insisted, "I cannot go against the Word of God. If the Word says that man dies and then faces judgment, I cannot make anyone return from death." The great-grandson threatened, "Then you will be stoned and thrown into the river as crocodile food." I said, "Okay, do not harm me. I will try to make your uncle live again."<br><br>

        They brought the body, wrapped in cloth, and placed it near me. At six in the evening, I began to cry out to God to put the spirit of life back into that man. I was given until four in the morning to raise him. Exhausted and tired of praying, I was told, "If you cannot, we will bury our uncle and you will be stoned to death." The family went to sleep, leaving some men to watch over me so I would not run away.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Miracle</p>

        <p>
        All night, as those men watched me, I saw my failure and began to think about my own death. As four o'clock approached, I prayed with faith, refusing to let my weakness overwhelm me. I remembered the revelation God had given me—that I would die in this last experience. I wondered, "Has the hour of my death come? Will I die at the hands of these men, stoned to death?"<br><br>

        At four in the morning, I prayed even more fervently: "Lord, hear me, help me, do not let me die. Raise this man up." But nothing happened. I was on my knees before the body when suddenly, the dead body shook and began to cough. The corpse rose from the ground—Jesus had raised that man! The people believed that Jesus is life, and I won the whole village for Christ. Only the sorcerers did not convert; they hated me because they could not make the dead walk. The chief sorcerers lost their credibility, and the gospel gained strength in that place.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Attack and Healing</p>

        <p>
        After the miracle, I took a shower, changed, and felt rejuvenated. I continued preaching the gospel in the village, but a poisonous snake bit my leg. I felt the fury of Satan over my life. The villagers grew fond of me and worried about my health. The village was far from the city, and there was little chance I could reach a hospital alive. Some men helped me walk for 15 minutes until we found a car, which took me to the nearest town.<br><br>

        Inside the car, I realized the wound was closing—something supernatural was happening. I was receiving a miracle. At the hospital, the doctors could not find the wound or any trace of the snake bite. They examined me and found no poison in my body. It was a miracle—God's healing had removed all the poison. I returned to the village and shared the miracle with the people.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">The Mission Team Arrives</p>

        <p>
        Leslie and six brothers from the United States arrived, having found the village thanks to the signs I left along the way. Leslie had dreamed of helping to carry my cross, and this dream was beginning to be fulfilled. I had finished my mission there, and we were ready to leave for the city.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Confrontation with the Sorcerer</p>

        <p>
        That night, I saw a sorcerer levitating, his feet not touching the ground, crossing the river by walking on water. He was the chief sorcerer of the village. The Lord revealed to me all the wickedness of this sorcerer—his spells caused car crashes and even plane crashes. He was disputing sovereignty with another sorcerer from a city called Point Noir. The Lord told me, "You have done your part here. The people you have won for the Kingdom of God will win many sorcerers. You must go to the town of Point Noir."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Division of the Mission</p>

        <p>
        The next day, Leslie, the six brothers, and I arrived at Point Noir. I divided the team to facilitate our mission. Maycon and Everton went together, Nathan and another brother paired up, Anthony and Leslie were the last pair, and I stayed with Brother Patrick. We began our mission in that place.<br><br>

        Anthony and Leslie argued and could not unite to win souls. I said, "When two do not agree, they should not go together." Leslie worked with me, and Anthony with Patrick. The work progressed until Maycon became ill and returned to the United States, leaving Everton alone. I advised Everton to return as well.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Persecution and Hardship</p>

        <p>
        Persecution was intense. Many rejected the gospel. Leslie, Nathan, Henry, Patrick, Anthony, and I suffered persecution. Nathan, fearing for his life, returned to the United States. Henry became ill, and Anthony claimed it was black magic. Terrified, Anthony also returned home. Patrick, without his partner, said he was not prepared and left as well. Henry recovered and chose to stay, declaring, "I'm not a coward. I'll stay until the mission is over." Leslie also decided to stay, recalling his dream of helping me carry the cross.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Spiritual Warfare</p>

        <p>
        I prayed to God for guidance, as many missionaries were falling ill. The Lord showed me in a vision that the sorcerer, the "Shadow of Death," was working hard with black magic to end our missionary work. The Holy Spirit revealed that the missionaries were not clothed in the armor of God, making them vulnerable to the sorcerer's attacks.<br><br>

        Henry, Leslie, and I continued evangelizing during the day. At night, Leslie fainted unexpectedly. Henry and I prayed for him. The Lord showed me a vision of the chief sorcerer casting a death spell meant for me. A black ball of light came toward me, but it did not penetrate and instead struck Leslie. I saw in the vision that the spell was death, and it entered Leslie's heart.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Leslie's Ordeal</p>

        <p>
        Leslie was not a believer with deep intimacy with God or a strong prayer life. Henry and I were spared because we lived consecrated, prayerful lives. All the missionaries who came with Leslie had returned, unprepared for spiritual warfare. Henry was the only one who showed psychological and spiritual readiness. Leslie, though not very spiritual, had been brave and worked hard.<br><br>

        I knew Leslie was not ready to die. He had dreamed of helping me carry the cross, and I believed his journey was not over. As I prayed for him, I came back to life. An angel appeared to Henry and me, calling my spirit. Henry held my body to keep it from falling. I did not understand what the angel wanted, but I obeyed and went with him down to hell.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Henry's Account</p>

        <p>
        Henry shares: "My name is Henry, and I'm on a mission for the first time with my pastor. I had never seen an angel before, but that night, I saw one appear to us. He shone like a white light. I was amazed by his beauty and the intimacy Pastor Kenzo had with the angel. I realized that to reach such spirituality, I must ascend the spiritual steps, living a life of prayer and holiness, as my pastor has."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Leslie's Experience in Hell</p>

        <p>
        Leslie recounts: "I'm Leslie, a member of the church where Pastor Kenzo found me. In the hotel, I felt a strong pain in my heart and struggled to breathe. My spirit entered a dark tunnel, leading to a vast, dark place filled with screams and fire. It was my first time in hell, and I witnessed its horrors. A devil caught me and threw me into a pit of fire. I felt deep pain and realized I was not prepared to die. My sins flashed before me—debts, unpaid loans, and more. I saw Anton LaVey, Aleister Crowley, and Lenin in hell, along with others who followed their teachings. Then, I saw Pastor Kenzo and the angel come to rescue me. The angel pulled me out of the pit, and together we visited various places in hell. When the angel brought me back to earth, I realized I was in my body again. After returning from hell, I made a covenant with God to live in holiness for the rest of my life."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 27</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Pastor Kenzo's Account of Hell</p>

        <p>
        I, Pastor Kenzo, report my experience in hell. Henry and I prayed for God to raise Leslie, knowing he was not in a good place. God allowed Leslie to die and go to hell as part of His plan for Leslie's spiritual growth. Today, Leslie is more spiritual and has become a vessel in God's hands.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 28</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">Christians in Hell</p>

        <p>
        The angel who led Leslie returned to me and took me to other places in hell. I saw believers in hell for:</p>
