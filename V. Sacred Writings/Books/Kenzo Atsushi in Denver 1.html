kenzo at sushi in denver one i live in
the city of denver united states the
1980s i am kenzo i pastor a strict
church i was always rebellious i did not
obey this small humble ministry
separated from the corrupt churches the
lord told me that he would use me but i
could not want fame and success because
when men exalt me i will lose all the
revelations that god will give me i
played a ball wearing shorts along with
the wicked one day god used a vessel and
rebuked me i was wearing a tank top in
the house
one day i was praying a voice rebuked me
when i accepted jesus i had to throw my
chains of the neck in the garbage the
holy spirit bothered me after a few
years of living a holy life white hair
began to grow on my head at that time i
had more intimacy with god when i dyed
my hair black a black smoke came out of
my hair when i covered my knee to pray a
voice rebuked me saying why do you want
to change what i have created do you not
accept its nature you know the natural
course is aging and dying the lord
reminded me in 1 peter 1 24 for all
flesh is his grass and all the glory of
man is the flower of grass the grass
withereth and the flower thereof falleth
away job 14 2 he cometh forth like a
flower and is cut down he fleeth also as
a shadow and continueth not after that
rebuke i have never again dyed my hair i
will confront you with my testimony i
have been hated for speaking the truth
pleasing god the man i will not diminish
this testimony and i will not increase
pleasant things just to smooth the ego
of those who are watching i want to
confront the hidden sins and announce
the false leadership i went to a church
where i saw a pastor who performed
miracles and healings people were healed
of incurable diseases that man let loose
the anointing and people in front of him
fell on the ground
he had great spiritual authority where
he put his hands things happened people
would whirl around when he put his hands
on their heads his ministry was full of
people i would visit this church where
this pastor was ministering i wanted to
adopt the same preaching style of him
and do great signs in my ministry but i
did not have the same gift of signs from
this pastor his name is charles markovam
his church was prosperous he lived doing
the work in several churches in the city
of denver i began to pray to god
requesting the same gift of pastor
charles but god did not answer me i did
not congregate in that pastor's ministry
my church was simple but one day god
used a vessel and said he would give me
a ministry of his own
i was already married i went home to
seek confirmation from god i fell on my
knees a voice told me i will put a
ministry in your hands it will be a
different church where i congregate i do
not want you to do theology my holy
spirit will teach you as he taught paul
and made him write several books of the
new testament i will teach you in a way
as no shepherd taught i will reveal my
mysteries and you will teach this flock
that i will put in your hands whatever i
speak to you you will teach them my
sheep will be responsible for them and
on the day of the rapture you will give
me the sheep i gave you
start reading from genesis to revelation
pray and fast i will reveal new things
which are hidden to the eyes of the wise
i have hidden them from theologians who
do not seek me i have hidden from the
proud but the humble i will reveal be a
humble servant make a covenant with me
today as the apostle paul did and you
will see the difference that you will
make in your life and god gave me a
ministry i always kept the simplicity of
a shepherd compared to pastors who had
high wages from their churches i never
depend on church money i could live from
the work of god and live to serve the
people 24 hours i chose not to live on
the offerings of the work so that the
money could be used to help the needy
the work of god is not to enrich the
pastor it is to help the needy i am an
entrepreneur of a business of my own
what iron i used to keep my family alive
and i still held the work of god money
has been a great problem for the egoists
who think of themselves and has
imprisoned many leading to the
condemnation of their souls brothers i
learned new things the holy spirit
taught me i cannot say that everything i
learned from my ex-pastor was in vain it
served me to understand the new
revelations of god when i started the
ministry right in the beginning god told
me not to put up miracle campaigns
asking for offering for everything i do
not want to ask for offerings what god
is not asked to offer i will not
negotiate the blessings of god to win
souls i want them to come to god for
love i have discarded any human method
to win souls i am not saying that it is
a sin to use intelligence strategies to
win souls since it does not hurt the
word of god the best direction is divine
instruction the one that comes from
heaven there are pastors who put theater
inside the church this is a hollywood
movie thing something diabolical that
uses human plans to win souls i went
through struggles in my ministry the
church i founded was small there was
only me my wife and one other brother
while the other churches were full
several brothers said that i had to call
evangelical singers famous lecturers to
attract crowds i said to the brother if
people are not going to come to worship
jesus i will not change him for others
who steal his worship he gave me this
ministry and it is in his hands the
brother said your ministry will close
i replied if it were my ministry i
believe it would close but this ministry
is not mine i said to the brother open a
word for me that brother opened a word
and went out in revelation 3 7 to 8 and
to the angel of the church in
philadelphia write these things say he
that is holy he that is true he that
hath the key of david he that openeth
and no man shutteth and shutteth and no
man openeth i know thy works behold i
have set before thee an open door and no
man can shut it for thou hast a little
strength and has kept my word and has
not denied my name the holy spirit began
to send lives to that place in a year my
ministry filled with people without
needing to offer blessings cars houses
healings the holy spirit healed and gave
gifts the brothers of other ministries
left their pastors to congregate with me
this caused jealousy in several
shepherds who only think dad to gather
but do not know how to teach sound
doctrine from the holy spirit all that
congregated with me said that there was
something different in the ministry that
god gave me they felt god very close to
them i said do you want to know what the
secret of this ministry is jesus is the
head he is in the direction we obey his
doctrines while the other churches have
as head the leaders not jesus and do not
obey his doctrines the holy spirit is
sad for their lack of submission the
churches are cold without the presence
of god all souls came to the church
because i was following god's direction
john 21 6-8 and he said unto them cast
the net on the right side of the ship
and ye shall find they cast therefore
and now they were not able to draw it
for the multitude of fishes therefore
that disciple whom jesus loved saith
unto peter it is the lord now when simon
peter heard that it was the lord he gird
his fisher's coat unto him for he was
naked and it cast himself into the sea
and the other disciples came in a little
ship for they were not far from land but
as it were 200 cubits bragging the net
with fishes i also obey the voice of
jesus this recipe worked well for my
ministry where there is sin there are
devils working and they are like worms
of the dead where there is rotting flesh
these worms come together sin is equal
to carrion that attracts all kind of a
devil the church that lives a holy life
a pure life the holy spirit draws in and
where he is the demons do not come
purity attracts purity dirt attracts
dirt several pastors of my neighborhood
began to persecute my ministry they said
that i was not of god they did not
announce false prophets who did
abominations but they attacked my
ministry they do not announce the false
churches
satan
does not bother with churches that do
their will or if they fight with dead
warriors only the true churches are
persecuted i had to denounce the false
churches the people need to come out
from within these prisons cages of the
false ones the false prophets three
pastors who touched my ministry died
without salvation and two others have
their churches closed because they did
everything to close that door of truth
that god opened if my ministry were to
lie i would have paid a high price
people have blasphemed against the holy
spirit saying that it is not god who
worked in my ministry who preaches sound
doctrine the lord said that for those
who blasphemed against the holy spirit
there is no more forgiveness
devils do everything they can to stop
these spirit-led churches to continue to
deceive the people they will deceive
even when they know what god wants their
days are coming where god will give an
end to all their evils gift of seer
after opening the ministry i receive the
gift of vision when i was a teenager i
received a prophecy that god would give
me the gift of vision and god fulfill
giving me a special gift for dedicating
my life to him the purpose of this gift
is to combat the spirit of deception
that is entering the churches at the
beginning when my eyes opened to the
spiritual world i was frightened i saw
several demons walking among the people
and others were flying in the air i was
terrified on one day but everything was
normal the next day it seemed that i had
lost the gift of sight then my eyes
opened and i saw the spiritual world
again i want to tell you that the gift
of sight is like any other whoever
receive the gift of healing will not go
out healing everyone one day several
people are healed through prayer the
next day no one is healed with the same
prayer the same thing is the lecturers
who have received the gift of the word
there would be a day that is preaching
will convert many people another day no
one will convert the gift of vision that
i have is no different there is a day
that i am allowed to see there is
another day that i can only see the
street of my house and the trees of my
street not always my eyes see the
spiritual world god only shows what he
wants and if he does not want to show he
will close our eyes
seeing the spiritual world every day
would not be good for my mind that would
take my focus from the reality of our
world thanks to this gift i can see what
happens behind the curtains of this
world it's a price i paid for i received
the demons do not want to be seen they
want to work in secret without anyone
knowing when someone reveals their
strategies they use people to attack
them angels are mostly seen inside
churches there they do their jobs they
do not walk around by the city equal to
the demons
false healing evangelist i was in pastor
charles's campaigns he had a new car he
had gotten a good life with the gain of
his ministry his gifts of signs
increased he was planning to put his
programming on television since he had a
radio program he thought of making a
leap and becoming known nationally i had
not been visiting in his ministry for a
long time he was the man who inspired me
i went there to get a response from god
from so much i pray the lord answered me
servant because you won the same gift of
this shepherd this gift i cannot give
you i was saddened by god's response
since for some time i had been praying
for this gift from pastor charles one
day the lord touched me to go to the
service of pastor charles when i got
there i sat down to listen to one of his
ministrations
something started to happen at that
moment my spiritual vision opened and i
could see a demon behind pastor charles
everything the devil spoke the pastor
repeated i saw a mark of a number 666 on
the forehead of that pastor he was being
controlled by that evil spirit the demon
exercised great mental control over his
mind that mark on the forehead made the
shepherd preach what the devil wanted
when pastor charles raised his hands
toward the people who were seated i
could see that in the palm of his hand
inside the skin had an inverted metal
star i do not know what metal it was i
could see that from that star emerge
laser beams that radiated all the people
many were healed demons went out i
prayed to god in spirit asking him to
reveal to me what was happening in this
service the lord said to me servant do
you understand why i cannot give you the
same gifts as this pastor he did not
make a covenant with me he made a
covenant with another god to give him
those gifts he accepted me but he did
not want to live a holy life he prefers
to live in luxury fulfilling the desires
of the flesh he did not want to pay the
price and prayer for the gifts i could
give him he preferred the easy way to
get these gifts and all the comfort he
wanted i'm giving him a chance to repent
and return to the path of light if he
turns to me i'll give him my gifts to
him and i will take away these gifts
from deceit i said lord he cast out
legions of demons the lord said servant
do not be deceived only ye who has my
holy spirit can drive out demons for the
light judges the darkness where darkness
is the light comes and illuminates
everything a shepherd who is a demon
cannot expel another remember the word
that i said when i was on the earth
matthew 12
24-26 but when the pharisees heard it
they said this fellow doth not cast out
devils but by beales above the prince of
the devils and
jesus knew their thoughts and said unto
them every kingdom divided against
itself is brought to desolation and
every city or house divided against
itself shall not stand and if satan cast
out satan he is divided against himself
how shall then his kingdom stand servant
the shepherd cannot cast out devils he
has a pact with them there is no kingdom
divided among demons all this is a farce
demons need to use someone to deceive
this shepherd is an instrument of demons
demons want people to trust in this
shepherd of deceit to win the souls of a
whole congregation the demons make many
signs so that this pastor never loses
credit and continues to deceive with
this false gospel that pastor is
reverenced many people trust in his
ministry believing that he is working
with my spirit
so when he gives orders to the demons
they go out so as not to tarnish his
ministry and so the spirit of the lie
continues to reign when the voice of the
lord spoke i stared at the pastor
charles he came down from the pulpit and
placed his hand where that inverted star
was and laid his hands on a woman's
stomach he revealed that woman had
cancer he expelled cancer i saw that a
cancer came out like a ball and went
into the shepherd's hand it seemed that
the star that was inserted into his hand
had a magnet that he used to pull cancer
out then he placed his hand to pray for
a man
that ball came out of his hand and it
entered into that man while that woman
was healed the man got cancer from her i
realized that the devil did not heal he
just transferred the diseases to other
bodies
false churches then i saw a big show
with technological effects flashing
lights to attract the young all caught
the attention of the crowd
there was a human strategy to attract
people there was a lot of manipulation
of faith within that church the demons
blinded the understandings of those
people through the signs all this
distracted the people and hold their
attention so that the demons did not let
them think what was wrong there the
spirit of deceit was there but many
churches are following the same
techniques of manipulation the demons
make those cults stay attractive to call
attention making them not see what is
wrong behind this ministry brothers and
sisters i saw demons inside those
churches i did not see god there there
was not an angel there everything was
delivered by the hands of the demons i
visited several churches where there
were devils there were also angels but
in that church i saw no angel i went
away sad to my house never again would i
put my feet in that church i thought
that every church was god's but many are
open to evil purposes run by people used
by demons my knee sank and i went to
pray to god i was ashamed to ask for an
equal gift from that false shepherd i
prayed to god and said where are those
holy people that make a difference and
put those demons to run a voice said to
me my people are not there they are all
imprisoned by deceit deprived of knowing
my word as it is for truth i cried for
the situation of people who are losing
their salvation it is what it says in
the word and i heard another voice from
heaven saying come out of her my people
that ye be not partakers of her sins and
that ye receive not of her plagues 4.
for sins have reached unto heaven and
god hath remembered her iniquities
revelation 18 4-5 do not look for a
church that offers pleasurable things to
your flesh look for a church that
troubles your flesh look for a holy
church that will make you walk the
narrow way god acts in churches like
that do not look for one church that
preaches with its sinful nature lets you
do what you want so that you are no
longer deceived satan transforms into an
angel of light to deceive you make you
believe that god is there god does not
well where there is iniquity the holy
spirit is clean never enter into a place
that defiles the name of god if you
insist on walking in the fallen churches
you will be deceived they will offer you
a gospel without a commitment to god
there the bride prostitutes yourself
with other gods nothing is a sin all is
grace
god is like a waiter to take and fulfill
your orders for blessings such churches
emphasize only on asking for blessings
but offer nothing to jesus who demands
holiness in the body soul and spirit
which husband would remain married to a
wife who does not give herself
completely who does not love him who
pretend in her love for him i want only
what he can offer but i do not want
commitment most churches are brides of
interest it hurts the heart of jesus
the holy spirit moves away accusers the
lord showed me a vision i saw how people
followed the blind shepherd and both
fell into the abyss
the people there are being deceived
where there is no truth there is no
liberation where there is no god's
people the demons reign and dominate i
will tell you what my rapture was like
the lord said to me at dawn i will
rapture you as i have done with several
people from the four corners of the
world i want to awaken them but many are
unbelievers i have snatched many to open
their eyes upon the reality of the
spiritual world they have criticized my
servants called them liars doubted their
revelations visions prophecies there
have been many signs in heaven and on
earth they do not want to wake up they
continue to call my servants false i am
going to shake the structures of the
earth so that they come to believe many
will go down to hell because of their
rebellions against my word they have
touched my spirit that has revealed
hidden things to the little ones they
have touched mine anointed i want to
bring them the awakening but they do not
want they are with spiritual deafness my
words enter by the right ear and leave
by the left their hearts are stony
grounds hard hearts they criticize my
servants they forget that i am who i am
who still reveal hidden things and
mysteries
jeremiah 33 3 call unto me and i will
answer thee and shoot the great and
mighty things which thou knowest not i
still watch over this word i warn warn
about the dangerous ways of those who
prefer to listen to false prophets
instead of listening to my little ones
i'm going to start scrapping many names
from the book of life of the critics of
truth i'm going to make it lawful for
the demon of death to take many who call
themselves christians for rebelling
against sound doctrine
satan has asked the souls of many i've
given chance to many but they are proud
they know nothing and think that they
know everything they say that satan is
under their feet but they who are under
the demons for not wanting to pound
their sins they say that satan has
already been defeated but they give
place to him to work they do not know
that satan is much smarter than the
whole human race and his experience of
deceiving people is from the garden of
eden to this day they do not take the
spiritual warfare seriously as the
angels do they say they are already
saved and will never lose their
salvation one saved will be saved
forever even if they sin
this brings complacency and lack of
vigilance in their spiritual lives and
satan take advantage of small openings
and enter your lives i'm going to take
you to hell and show you only the places
of christians who have been overcome by
accommodating their sins i heard only
the voice of jesus when he manifested to
me with his body of glory lights came
out of his face and his body jesus and i
went to hell we arrived in that dark
place full of red fires the blood of
souls gave a color to those fires
blasphemy against the holy spirit i
arrived at a place where the deviants
who left the church and where the other
group of deviants who were still inside
the church they were part of the
churches but they did not live the word
i went to a place where i saw brethren
who had blasphemed against the holy
spirit i asked jesus who are these
people who blaspheme against the holy
spirit he answered me when the holy
spirit uses a person who lives in
holiness and someone says that person is
being used by demons they are calling my
spirit a monster that is an offense and
when they die they will be called a
monster here in hell they will live in
great suffering there is no forgiveness
for those who blaspheme i have seen
catholic people who blasphemed and mock
the spirit of god i saw pastors who
blasphemed the holy spirit as well
jesus passed by a bishop and he asked
forgiveness for blasphemy jesus said
whosoever shall blaspheme my spirit is
condemnation is certain i saw a brother
who blasphemed my ministry saying that
the demons use me in the visions and
revelations he blasphemed jesus's spirit
clothing tattoos i went to a place where
i saw several brothers walking in the
street wearing a tank top others walking
shirtless causing scandal to speak they
were in hell they were shepherds bishops
apostles who dyed their hair made
tattoos these treated the temple of the
holy spirit as if it were the temple of
the world i saw shepherds wearing chains
around their necks they seemed to be
wrappers they wore wide clothes they
were in hell
spirit of seduction the high-heeled
sister asked for forgiveness and cried
this sister had the spirit of seduction
she was jiggling
d-i-v-o-r-c-e-i
there were shepherds and bishops who had
more than two marriages and were
marrying for the third time analyzing
the holy marriage that god left they
were scandal to the evangelical milieu
there were carnal believers who divorced
to marry as many times as they want to
they died without asking forgiveness for
their sins and were in hell mark 10 7 to
9 for this cause shall a man leave his
father and mother and cleave to his wife
and they twain shall be one flesh so
then they are no more twain but one
flesh what therefore god hath joined
together let not man put asunder bad
b-o-o-k-s-i-e i went to a gallery in
hell i saw magazines of the sentinel i
saw evangelical books with false
doctrines spiritus books and spell books
and books of doctrines of devils school
books of philosophy saying that man came
from the monkey that the universe was
created alone denying the existence of
god all these books teach contrary to
the word of god this is in the books of
education as those of science history
among others everything to control the
minds just like the pastor charles who
had a spiritual mark on his forehead 1
timothy 4 1-2 now the spirit speaketh
expressly that in the latter times some
shall depart from the faith giving heat
to seducing spirits and doctrines of
devil speaking lies in hypocrisy having
their conscience seared with a hot iron
satan has entered into theology to blind
the understanding 2 corinthians 4 4 in
whom the god of this world hath blinded
the minds of them which believe not lest
the light of the glorious gospel of
christ who is the image of god should
shine unto them i read only the bible
and the holy spirit teaches me
ecclesiastes 12 12-13 and further by
these my son be admonished of making
many books there is no end and much
study is a weariness of the flesh let us
hear the conclusion of the whole matter
fear god and keep his commandments for
this is the whole duty of man books of
theology filled with human ideologies
and nothing to holiness
c-o-m-i-c-s-e
i have seen cartoons batman comic books
superman spider-man and others i have
seen varieties of consecrated comics
enter the minds of children in order to
change their attitudes make them
disrespectful to parents make them
become lesbian homosexual violent by
causing them to see child pornographic
content these cartoon comics and comic
books were full of darts and little
black pins that pierced the minds of
those who read them toys and d-o-l-l-s
if i saw devil like toys like female
dolls there were a variety of dolls that
they can find little demons inside them
these dolls bring tribulation to the
homes leaving the children in a state of
disturbance i also saw male dolls that
carried little demons i went to a place
where there were several rebellious
teenagers who fought their parents and
they were there because they were
addicted to games the demons had these
children leaving them rebellious video
g-a-m-e-s-v
these demons came out in video games
causing many young people to fall into
hell they had dreams they planned
futures but they died with all this all
their projects died there how sad to see
our youth getting lost the future of the
church is being destroyed satan has set
up a plan to destroy the children and
youth to have no more churches he is
forming an unbelieving generation
through drawings and films this
generation will worship the antichrist i
have seen his whole plan in hell
hell
the lord jesus said tell all that you
have seen but those who do not believe
in this testimony will be the tares i
will charge those and i will throw the
tares the persecute him in the fire i
ravish my servants for love i do not
want to see anybody in hell i cry for
every soul that descends to this place
but they do not want to hear they forget
that i am love but i am justice and i
punish the rebels church is false
prophets the lord and i went up to the
earth the lord said to me who will
prophecy on the dry bones of these
churches if the false prophets do not
let my servants preach the truth they
say that they do not cast off sin
because the holy spirit is not testified
in their spirits but the holy spirit
cannot testify in dead spirits they are
far from me far from my ways they do not
hear my voice do not feel my spirit that
is so close to them they have lost their
spiritual sensibilities 90 of these
churches will not rise only 10 will rise
leviticus 27 30 and all the tithe of the
land whether the seed of the land or of
the fruit of the tree is the lord's it
is holy unto the lord these were his
last words the lord left me in my room
where my body was the next day i told
the church where i pastor after these
revelations i was very strict because
satan does not play the lord jesus is
not happy with the situation of the
churches they are dead most of them are
in ruins the holy spirit told me the
bridegroom has not sought the bride yet
because there are few that are prepared
he wants more souls to reap altars must
be restored these runes must be repaired
and raised for the number of brides to
increase pray with me lord jesus today i
repent of my sins i believe that the
lord shed his blood to save me leaving
his throne of glory to die a terrible
death of the cross i know that i have
not walked in the paths of his way that
pleases him resist temptations as the
lord resisted the lord is my salvation
he is my deliverer he is risen from the
dead and is ascended to the sky one day
you will come with all his glory i want
to go up with you i believe that i
belong to you i am your son and heir of
your promises the day i make a covenant
with you just like the one you did on
the cross
