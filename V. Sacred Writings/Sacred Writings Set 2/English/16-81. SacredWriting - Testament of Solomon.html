        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
                

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Testament of Solomon, son of David, who was king in Jerusalem, and
        mastered and controlled all spirits of the air, on the earth, and under the
        earth. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> By means of them also he wrought all the transcendent works of he
        Temple. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> Telling also of the authorities they wield against men, and by what
        angels these demons are brought to naught.<br>
        <sup>4</sup> Of the sage Solomon.<br>
        <sup>5</sup> Blessed art thou, O Lord God, who didst give Solomon such authority. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Glory to thee and might unto the ages. Amen.</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And behold, when the Temple of the city of Jerusalem was being builded,
        and the artificers were working thereat, Ornias the demon came among them
        toward sunset; and he took away half of the pay of the chief-deviser's 
        little boy, as well as half his food. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> He also continued to suck the thumb of his right hand every day. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And the child grew thin, although he was
        very much loved by the king.</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> So King Solomon called the boy one day, and questioned him, saying: "Do I
        not love thee more than all the artisans who are working in the Temple of
        God? <br>
        <sup>2</sup> Do I not give thee double wages and a double supply of food? <br>
        <sup>3</sup> How is it that day by day and hour by hour thow growest thinner?"</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> But the child said to the king: "I pray thee, O king. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> Listen to what has befallen all that thy child hath. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> After we are all released from our work on the Temple of God, after sunset, when I lie down to rest, one of the evil demons comes and takes away from me one half of my pay and one half of my food. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Then he also takes hold of my right hand and sucks my thumb. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And lo, my soul is opressed, and so my body waxes thinner every day."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Now when I Solomon heard this, I entered the Temple of God, and prayed
        with all my soul, night and day, that the demon might be delivered into my
        hands, and that I might gain authority over him. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And it came about through my prayer that grace was given to me from the Lord Sabaoth by Michael his archangel. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> [He brought me] a little ring, having a seal consisting of an engraved stone, and said to me: "Take, O Solomon, king, son of David, the gift which the Lord God has sent thee, the highest Sabaoth. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> With it thou shalt lock up all demons of the earth, male and female; and with their help thou shalt build up Jerusalem. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> [But] thou [must] wear this seal of God. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And this engraving of the seal of the ring sent thee is a Pentalpha."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I Solomon was overjoyed, and praised and glorified the God of heaven
        and earth. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And on the morrow I called the boy, and gave him the ring, and said to him: "take this, and at the hour in which the demon shall come unto thee, throw this ring at the chest of the demon, and say to him: 'In the name of God, King Solomon calls thee hither.' <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And then do thou come running to me, without having any misgivings or fear in respect of aught thou mayest hear on the part of the demon."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> So the child took the ring, and went off; and behold, at the customary hour Ornias, the fierce demon, came like a burning fire to take the pay from the child. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> But the child according to the instructions received from the king, threw the ring at the chest of the demon, and said: "King Solomon calls thee hither." <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And then he went off at a run to the king. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> But the demon cried out aloud, saying: "Child, why hast thou done this to me?<br>
        <sup>5</sup> Take the ring off me, and I will render to thee the gold of the earth. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Only take this off me, and forbear to lead me away to Solomon."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> But the child said to the demon: "As the Lord God of Israel liveth, I will not brook thee. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> So come hither." And the child came at a run, rejoicing, to the king, and said: "I have brought the demon, O king, as thou didst command me, O my master. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And behold, he stands before the gates of the court of thy palace, crying out, and supplicating with a loud voice; offering me the silver and gold of the earth if I will only bring him unto thee."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And when Solomon heard this, he rose up from his throne, and went outside into the vestibule of the court of his palace; and there he saw the demon, shuddering and trembling. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And he said to him: "Who art thou?" <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And the demon answered: "I am called Ornias."<br></p>

        
        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And Solomon said to him: "Tell me, O demon, to what zodiacal sign thou art subject." And he answered: "To thw Water-pourer. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And those who are consumed with desire for the noble virgins upon earth . . . . . [there appears to be a lacuna here], these I strangle. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> But in case there is no disposition to sleep, I am changed into three forms. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> Whenever men come to be enamoured of women, I metamorphose myself into a comely female; and I take hold of the men in their sleep, and play with them. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And after a while I again take to my wings, and hie me to the heavenly regions. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> I also appear as a lion, and I am commanded by all the demons. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> I am offspring of the archangel Uriel, the power of God." </p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> I Solomon, having heard the name of the archangel, prayed and glorified God, the Lord of heaven and earth. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And I sealed the demon and set him to work at stone-cutting, so that he might cut the stones in the Temple, which, lying along the shore, had been brought by the Sea of Arabia. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> But he, fearful of the iron, continued and said to me: "I pray thee, King Solomon, let me go free; and I will bring you all the demons." <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And as he was not willing to be subject to me, I prayed the archangel Uriel to come and succour me; and I forthwith beheld the archangel Uriel coming down to me from the heavens. </p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And the angel bade the whales of the sea come out of the abyss. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And he cast his destiny upon the ground, and that [destiny] made subject [to him] the great demon. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And he commanded the great demon and bold Ornias, to cut stones at the Temple. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And accordingly I Solomon glorified the God of heaven and Maker of the earth. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And he bade Ornias come with his destiny, and gave him the seal, saying: "Away with thee, and bring me hither the prince of all the demons."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> So Ornias took the finger-ring, and went off to Beelzeboul, who has kingship over the demons. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> He said to him: "Hither! Solomon calls thee." But Beelzeboul, having heard, said to him: "Tell me, who is this Solomon of whom thou speakest to me?" <br>
        <sup>3</sup> Then Ornias threw the ring at the chest of Beelzeboul, saying: "Solomon the king calls thee." <br>
        <sup>4</sup> But Beelzeboul cried aloud with a mighty voice, and shot out a great burning flame of fire; and he arose, and followed Ornias, and came to Solomon. </p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And when I saw the prince of demons, I glorified the Lord God, Maker of heaven and earth, and I said: <br>
        <sup>2</sup> "Blessed art thou, Lord God Almighty, who hast given to Solomon thy servant wisdom, the assessor of the wise, and hast subjected unto me all the power of he devil."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I questioned him, and said: "Who art thou?" The demon replied: "I am Beelzebub, the exarch of the demons. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And all the demons have their chief seats close to me. And I it is who make manifest the apparition of each demon." <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And he promised to bring to me in bonds all the unclean spirits. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And I again glorified the God of heaven and earth, as I do always give thanks to him. </p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> I then asked of the demon if there were females among them. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And when he told me that there were, I said that I desired to see them. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> So Beelzeboul went off at high speed, and brought unto me Onoskelis, that had a very pretty shape, and the skin of a fair-hued woman; and she tossed her head.</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And when she was come, I said to her: "Tell me who art thou?'' <br>
        <sup>2</sup> But she said to me: "I am called Onoskelis, a spirit wrought ...[?shabtai/Saturn?], lurking upon the earth. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> There is a golden cave where I lie. But I have a place that ever shifts. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> At one time I strangle men with a noose; at another, I creep up from the nature to the arms [in marg: "worms"]. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> But my most frequent dwelling-places are the precipices, caves, ravines. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Oftentimes, however, do I consort with men in the semblance of a woman, and above all with those of a dark skin. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> For they share my star with me; since they it is who privily or openly worship my star, without knowing that they harm themselves, and but whet my appetite for further mischief. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> For they wish to provide money by means of memory (commemoration?), but I supply a little to those who worship me fairly."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I Solomon questioned her about her birth, and she replied: "I was born of a voice untimely, the so-called echo of a man's ordure dropped in a wood."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I said to her: "Under what star dost thou pass?" And she answered me: <br>
        <sup>2</sup> "Under the star of the full moon, for the reason that the moon travels over most things." <br>
        <sup>3</sup> Then I said to her: "And [20] what angel is it that frustrates thee?" <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And she said to me: "He that in thee [or "through thee" is reigning." <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And I thought that she mocked me, and bade a soldier strike her. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> But she cried aloud, and said: "I am [subjected] to thee, O king, by the wisdom of God given to thee, and by the angel Joel."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> So I commanded her to spin the hemp for the ropes used in the building of the house of God; <br>
        <sup>2</sup> and accordingly, when I had sealed and bound her, she was so overcome and brought to naught as to stand night and day spinning the hemp.</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
         
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I at once bade another demon to be led unto me; and instantly there approached me the demon Asmodeus, bound, and I asked him: "Who art thou ?' <br>
        <sup>2</sup> But he shot on me a glance of anger and rage, and said: "And who art thou?' <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And I said to him: "Thus punished as thou art, answerest thou me?" But he, with rage, said to me: "But how shall I answer thee, for thou art a son of man;  <br>
        <sup>4</sup> whereas I was born an angel's seed by a daughter of man, so that no word of our heavenly kind addressed to the earth-born can be overweening.  <br>
        <sup>5</sup> Wherefore also my star is bright in heaven, and men call it, some the Wain, and some the dragon's child.  <br>
        <sup>6</sup> I keep near unto this star.  <br>
        <sup>7</sup> So ask me not many things; for thy kingdom also after a little time is to be disrupted, and thy glory is but for a season.  <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And short will be thy tyranny over us; and then we shall again have free range over mankind, so as that they shall revere us as if we were gods, not knowing, men that they are, the names of the angels set over us."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
         
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I Solomon, on hearing this, bound him more carefully, and ordered him to be flogged with thongs of ox-hide, and to tell me humbly what was his name and what his business. And he answered me thus:  <br>
        <sup>2</sup> "I am called Asmodeus among mortals, and my business is to plot against the newly wedded, so that they may not know one another.  <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And I sever them utterly by many calamities, and I waste away the beauty of virgin women, and estrange their hearts."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I said to him: "Is this thy only business?" And he answered me: "I transport men into fits of madness and desire, when they have wives of their own, so that they leave them, and go off by night and day to others that belong to other men; <br>
        <sup>2</sup> with the result that they commit sin, and fall into murderous deeds." </p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
         
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I adjured him by the name of the Lord Sabaôth, saying: "Fear God, Asmodeus, and tell me by what angel thou art frustrated."  <br>
        <sup>2</sup> But he said: "By Raphael, the archangel that stands before the throne of God.  <br>
        <sup>3</sup> But the liver and gall of a fish put me to flight, when smoked over ashes of the tamarisk."  <br>
        <sup>4</sup> I again asked him, and said: "Hide not aught from me.  <br>
        <sup>5</sup> For I am Solomon, son of David, King of Israel.  <br>
        <sup>6</sup> Tell me the name of the fish which thou reverest."  <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And he answered: "It is the Glanos by name, and is found in the rivers of Assyria; wherefore it is that I roam about in those parts." </p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I said to him: "Hast thou nothing else about thee, Asmodeus?" And he answered: <br>
        <sup>2</sup> "The power of God knoweth, which hath bound me with the indissoluble bonds of yonder one's seal, that whatever I have told thee is true. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> I pray thee, King Solomon, condemn me not to [go into] water." <br>
        <sup>4</sup> But I smiled, and said to him: "As the Lord God of my fathers liveth, I will lay iron on thee to wear. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> But thou shalt also make the clay for the entire construction of the Temple, treading it down with thy feet." <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And I ordered them to give him ten water-jars to carry water in. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And the demon groaned terribly, and did the work I ordered him to do. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And this I did, because that fierce demon Asmodeus knew even the future. And I Solomon glorified God, who gave wisdom to me Solomon his servant. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> And the liver of the fish and its gall I hung on the spike of a reed, and burned it over Asmodeus because of his being so strong, and his unbearable malice was thus frustrated. </p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I summoned again to stand before me Beelzeboul, the prince of demons, and I sat him down on a raised seat of honour, and said to him: <br>
        <sup>2</sup> "Why art thou alone, prince of the demons?" And he said to me: <br>
        <sup>3</sup> "Because I alone am left of the angels of heaven that came down. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> For I was first angel in the first heaven being entitled Beelzeboul. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And now I control all those who are bound in Tartarus. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> But I too have a child, and he haunts the Red Sea. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And on any suitable occasion he comes up to me again, being subject to me; <br>
        <sup>8</sup> and reveals to me what he has done, and I support him.</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 27</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>

        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> I Solomon said unto him: "Beelzeboul, what is thy employment?" And he answered me: "I destroy kings. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> I ally myself with foreign tyrants. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And my own demons I set on to men, in order that the latter may believe in them and be lost. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And the chosen servants of God, priests and faithful men, I excite unto desires for wicked sins, and evil heresies, and lawless deeds; and they obey me, and I bear them on to destruction. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And I inspire men with envy, and [desire for] murder, and for wars and sodomy, and other evil things. <br>

        <sup>4</sup> And the demon blew through the middle of the finger-ring into the mouth of the flask, and going in blew out the flask. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> But the man promptly stood up to it and drew tight with his hand the mouth of the flask, in the name of the Lord God of Sabaôth. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And the demon remained within the flask. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And after that the youth remained in that land three days to make trial. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And the spirit no longer blew against that city. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> And all the Arabs knew that he had safely shut in the spirit.</p><br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Then the youth fastened the flask on the camel, and the Arabs sent him forth on his way with much honour and precious gifts, praising and magnifying the God of Israel. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> But the youth brought in the bag and laid it in the middle of the Temple. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And on the next day, I King Solomon, went into the Temple of God and sat in deep distress about the stone of the end of the corner. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And when I entered the Temple, the flask stood up and walked around some seven steps and then fell on its mouth and did homage to me. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And I marvelled that even along with the bottle the demon still had power and could walk about; and I commanded it to stand up. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And the flask stood up, and stood on its feet all blown out. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And I questioned him, saying: "Tell me, who art thou?" And the spirit within said: "I am the demon called Ephippas, that is in Arabia." <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And I said to him: "Is this thy name?" And he answered: "Yes; wheresoever I will, I alight and set fire and do to death."</p><br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I said to him: "By what angel art thou frustrated?" And he answered: "By the only-ruling God, that hath authority over me even to be heard. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> He that is to be born of a virgin and crucified by the Jews on a cross. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> Whom the angels and archangels worship. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> He doth frustrate me, and enfeeble me of my great strength, which has been given me by my father the devil." <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And I said to him: "What canst thou do?'' And he answered: ''I am able to remove mountains, to overthrow the oaths of kings. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> I wither trees and make their leaves to fall off." <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And I said to him: "Canst thou raise this stone, and lay it for the beginning of this corner which exists in the fair plan of the Temple?'' <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And he said: "Not only raise this, O king; but also, with the help of the demon who presides over the Red Sea, I will bring up the pillar of air, and will stand it where thou wilt in Jerusalem.''</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 123</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Saying this, I laid stress on him, and the flask became as if depleted of air. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And I placed it under the stone, and (the spirit) girded himself up, and lifted it up top of the flask. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And the flask went up the steps, carrying the stone, and laid it down at the end of the entrance of the Temple. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And I Solomon, beholding the stone raised aloft and placed on a foundation, said: "Truly the Scripture is fulfilled, which says: 'The stone which the builders rejected on trial, that same is become the head of the corner.' <br>
        <sup>5</sup> For this it is not mine to grant, but God's, that the demon should be strong enough to lift up so great a stone and deposit it in the place I wished."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 124</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And Ephippas led the demon of the Red Sea with the column. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And they both took the column and raised it aloft from the earth. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And I outwitted these two spirits, so that they could not shake the entire earth in a moment of time. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And then I sealed round with my ring on this side and that, and said: "Watch." <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And the spirits have remained upholding it until this day, for proof of the wisdom vouchsafed to me. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And there the pillar was hanging of enormous size, in mid air, supported by the winds. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And thus the spirits appeared underneath, like air, supporting it. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And if one looks fixedly, the pillar is a little oblique, being supported by the spirits; and it is so to day.</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 125</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I Solomon questioned the other spirit which came up with the pillar from the depth of the Red Sea. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And I said to him: "Who art thou, and what calls thee? <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And what is thy business? <br>
        <sup>4</sup> For I hear many things about thee.'' <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And the demon answered: "I, O King Solomon, am called Abezithibod. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> I am a descendant of the archangel. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> Once as I sat in the first heaven, of which the name is Ameleouth -- I then am a fierce spirit and winged, and with a single wing, plotting against every spirit under heaven. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> I was present when Moses went in before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and I hardened his heart. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> I am he whom Iannes and Iambres invoked homing with Moses in Egypt. <br>
        <sup>10</sup> I am he who fought against Moses with wonders with signs."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 126</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> I said therefore to him: "How wast thou found in the Red Sea?" <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And he answered: "In the exodus of the sons of Israel I hardened the heart of Pharaoh. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And I excited his heart and that of his ministers. And I caused them to pursue after the children of Israel. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And Pharaoh followed with (me) and all the Egyptians. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> Then I was present there, and we followed together. <br>
        <sup>6</sup> And we all came up upon the Red Sea. <br>
        <sup>7</sup> And it came to pass when the children of Israel had crossed over, the water returned and hid all the host of the Egyptians and all their might. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And I remained in the sea, being kept under this pillar. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> But when Ephippas came, being sent by thee, shut up in the vessel of a flask, he fetched me up to thee."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 127</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> I, therefore, Solomon, having heard this, glorified God and adjured the demons not to disobey me, but to remain supporting the pillar. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And they both sware, saying: "The Lord thy God liveth, we will not let go this pillar until the world's end. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> But on whatever day this stone fall, then shall be the end of the world."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 128</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And I Solomon glorified God, and adorned the Temple of the Lord with all fair-seeming. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> And I was glad in spirit in my kingdom, and there was peace in my days. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And I took wives of my own from every land, who were numberless. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And I marched against the Jebusaeans, and there I saw Jebusaean, daughter of a man: and fell violently in love with her, and desired to take her to wife along with my other wives. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And I said to their priests: "Give me the Sonmanites (i.e. Shunammite) to wife." <br>
        <sup>6</sup> But the priests of Moloch said to me: "If thou lovest this maiden, go in and worship our gods, the great god Raphan and the god called Moloch." <br>
        <sup>7</sup> I therefore was in fear of the glory of God, and did not follow to worship. <br>
        <sup>8</sup> And I said to them: "I will not worship a strange god. <br>
        <sup>9</sup> What is this proposal, that ye compel me to do so much?" But they said: ". . . . . by our fathers."</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 129</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> And when I answered that I would on no account worship strange gods, they told the maiden not to sleep with me until I complied and sacrificed to the gods. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> I then was moved, but crafty Eros brought and laid by her for me five grasshoppers, saying: "Take these grasshoppers, and crush them together in the name of the god Moloch; and then will I sleep with you." <br>
        <sup>3</sup> And this I actually did. <br>
        <sup>4</sup> And at once the Spirit of God departed from me, and I became weak as well as foolish in my words. <br>
        <sup>5</sup> And after that I was obliged by her to build a temple of idols to Baal, and to Rapha, and to Moloch, and to the other idols.</p><br>

        
        <h2>Chapter 130  </h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle"></p>
        
        <p>
        <sup>1</sup> I then, wretch that I am, followed her advice, and the glory of God quite departed from me; and my spirit was darkened, and I became the sport of idols and demons. <br>
        <sup>2</sup> Wherefore I wrote out this Testament, that ye who get possession of it may pity, and attend to the last things, and not to the first. <br>
        <sup>3</sup> So that ye may find grace for ever and ever. Amen.</p><br>
