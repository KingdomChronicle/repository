        <!-------------------------------START OF LESSON 1  ------------------------------->
                    
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"></p> -->
        
       <p><sup>1</sup> This is a copy of the letter of Jeremiah to the people of Jerusalem before they were taken captive to Babylon by the king of Babylon. He wrote it to deliver to them the message of God. This is what he said:</p>
       <p><sup>2</sup> “You have sinned against God, and that is why He allowed King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to take you as captives.</p>
       <p><sup>3</sup> You will remain in captivity in Babylon for a long time, until the seventh generation. After that, God will set you free and bring you back to your land in peace.</p>
       <p><sup>4</sup> In Babylon, you will see idols made of wood, gold, and silver. These idols, carried around by people, are greatly feared by pagans.</p>
       <p><sup>5</sup> Do not imitate them. Do not be afraid of those idols even if you see them being paraded and worshiped.</p>
       <p><sup>6</sup> Instead, keep this in mind: ‘Lord, You alone will we worship.’</p>
       <p><sup>7</sup> My angel will be with you and will protect you.</p>
       <p><sup>8</sup> Their idols are covered with gold and silver and have tongues carved by artisans. But they cannot speak, because they are not real gods.</p>
       <p><sup>9</sup> People make golden crowns for them, like women fond of jewelry.</p>
       <p><sup>10</sup> Sometimes, the gold and silver offered to them are taken by the priests and used for themselves.</p>
       <p><sup>11</sup> At times, the offerings are even given as payment to temple prostitutes. These idols of wood, gold, and silver are dressed up like human beings.</p>
       <p><sup>12</sup> Even though they wear fine purple robes like kings, they are still eaten by termites and rust.</p>
       <p><sup>13</sup> They gather dust in the temple and need someone to wipe their faces.</p>
       <p><sup>14</sup> They hold scepters like judges, but they have no power to judge those who insult them.</p>
       <p><sup>15</sup> Some hold axes and daggers, yet cannot defend themselves from war or theft.</p>
       <p><sup>16</sup> All these show they are not gods. Therefore, do not worship them.</p>
       <p><sup>17</sup> These idols, kept in their temples, are no different from broken dishes that serve no purpose. Their eyes are full of dust brought in by the feet of those entering the temple.</p>
       <p><sup>18</sup> The priests lock the temple doors to keep out thieves. Thus, the idols are imprisoned like criminals sentenced to die for betraying the king.</p>
       <p><sup>19</sup> The priests light many lamps for them—more than they need. But not one of those lights is seen by the idols.</p>
       <p><sup>20</sup> Inside, they are eaten by termites like the wooden posts of the temple. Their garments deteriorate, but they do not notice.</p>
       <p><sup>21</sup> Their faces turn black from the temple smoke.</p>
       <p><sup>22</sup> Bats, swallows, and other birds perch on them, and cats sit on them.</p>
       <p><sup>23</sup> All of this proves they are not gods. So, do not worship them.</p>
       <p><sup>24</sup> These idols may be covered with pure gold to make them look beautiful, but they will not shine unless polished. They did not even feel it when they were melted and molded.</p>
       <p><sup>25</sup> Though they are costly, they have no breath.</p>
       <p><sup>26</sup> They may have feet, but they cannot walk. People have to carry and bear them. They are truly worthless.</p>
       <p><sup>27</sup> Even those who care for them are ashamed, for when the idols fall, they cannot stand up on their own. If someone sets them up, they cannot move. If they tilt, they cannot fix themselves. Offering sacrifices to them is like offering to the dead.</p>
       <p><sup>28</sup> The priests sell the offerings made to these idols and use the money for themselves. Some are kept by the priests’ wives instead of being shared with the poor.</p>
       <p><sup>29</sup> Even women who have just given birth or are menstruating are allowed to touch the offerings. All of this proves they are not true gods. Therefore, never worship them.</p>
       <p><sup>30</sup> How can these idols made of wood, gold, and silver be called gods? Even women are allowed to offer sacrifices to them.”</p>
       <p><sup>31</sup> During times of mourning, the priests sit in the temple with torn garments, shaved beards, and uncovered heads.</p>
       <p><sup>32</sup> They cry out and wail before those idols like hired mourners lamenting over the dead.</p>
       <p><sup>33</sup> Sometimes, the priests take the garments of those idols and put them on their wives and children.</p>
       <p><sup>34</sup> Whether these idols are served or insulted, they cannot retaliate. They cannot install or remove a king.</p>
       <p><sup>35</sup> They cannot enrich anyone. If someone makes a vow to them and does not fulfill it, they cannot enforce it.</p>
       <p><sup>36</sup> They cannot save anyone from death, nor can they defend the oppressed.</p>
       <p><sup>37</sup> They cannot restore sight to the blind or rescue anyone in distress.</p>
       <p><sup>38</sup> They have no compassion for widows and show no concern for orphans.</p>
       <p><sup>39</sup> These idols made of wood, covered in gold and silver, are no better than a rock carved from a mountain. Those who worship them will only be put to shame.</p>
       <p><sup>40</sup> How, then, can they be considered or called gods? What the Babylonians do to them only brings them shame.</p>
       <p><sup>41</sup> For example, they bring a mute person to the temple of Bel and pray for the person to speak, as though Bel could understand.</p>
       <p><sup>42</sup> Even though they know their idols cannot help, they continue to worship them out of foolishness.</p>
       <p><sup>43</sup> Women line up along the roadside, with cords tied around them, burning chaff in place of incense. They offer themselves as prostitutes. When one is chosen by a man, she boasts and mocks the others, claiming they are less attractive since no one picked them.</p>
       <p><sup>44</sup> Everything associated with these idols is deception and folly. How can they be considered or called gods?</p>
       <p><sup>45</sup> They are merely the works of carpenters and metalworkers. They only take the form the craftsmen want them to have.</p>
       <p><sup>46</sup> Even the men who made them will not live long. So how can what they created be gods?</p>
       <p><sup>47</sup> What those people leave to future generations is nothing but deceit and disgrace.</p>
       <p><sup>48</sup> When war or disaster comes, the priests decide where to hide those idols.</p>
       <p><sup>49</sup> They are powerless in the face of war and danger. Why can’t people see that these statues can never be gods?</p>
       <p><sup>50</sup> These idols are made only of wood and covered in gold and silver. The time will come when it will be proven that they are not gods.</p>
       <p><sup>51</sup> All kings and nations will come to recognize that these idols are merely man-made and do not possess the power of the God of Israel.</p>
       <p><sup>52</sup> Is there anyone who does not know this?</p>
       <p><sup>53</sup> They cannot make anyone a king, nor can they cause rain to fall.</p>
       <p><sup>54</sup> They cannot resolve their own issues or give justice to the oppressed. Like birds flying aimlessly, they are useless!</p>
       <p><sup>55</sup> If a fire breaks out in the temple, the priests run away and leave behind the wooden idols covered in gold and silver. They burn like ordinary wooden posts.</p>
       <p><sup>56</sup> They cannot fight against kings or attack any enemy. Who could possibly believe they are gods?</p>
       <p><sup>57</sup> These idols made of wood and overlaid with gold and silver cannot resist thieves or bandits.</p>
       <p><sup>58</sup> They are powerless to stop them from taking their gold, silver, or clothing.</p>
       <p><sup>59</sup> A brave king or even a useful household item is better than these idols. Better is a door that guards a house against theft. Even a wooden pillar in a palace is more valuable than these so-called gods.</p>
       <p><sup>60</sup> God created the sun, the moon, and the stars to give light, and they obey Him.</p>
       <p><sup>61</sup> The same is true for lightning and wind. Lightning flashes across the sky, and the wind blows in all directions at His command.</p>
       <p><sup>62</sup> When God orders the clouds to spread over the earth, they obey.</p>
       <p><sup>63</sup> When He commands fire to descend from heaven to consume mountains and forests, it responds immediately. But these idols cannot do any of these things. They cannot even imitate them.</p>
       <p><sup>64</sup> Why then should they be considered gods, when they cannot judge us or do any good?</p>
       <p><sup>65</sup> You know they are not gods, so do not worship them.</p>
       <p><sup>66</sup> Those idols have no power over kings; they cannot curse or bless them.</p>
       <p><sup>67</sup> They cannot give any signs to nations from heaven; they cannot shine like the sun or the moon.</p>
       <p><sup>68</sup> Wild animals are better than they are, for at least they can escape danger or defend themselves.</p>
       <p><sup>69</sup> It is as clear as daylight that they are not gods. So do not worship them.</p>
       <p><sup>70</sup> These idols made of wood and overlaid with gold and silver are like scarecrows in a field.</p>
       <p><sup>71</sup> Like a thorny bush in a garden that birds perch on rather than fear, these idols are like corpses thrown into the darkness.</p>
       <p><sup>72</sup> Their fine garments, now torn and decaying, prove that they are not gods. In the end, even their wooden bodies will be eaten by termites, and they will become a laughingstock throughout the land.</p>
       <p><sup>73</sup> Blessed is the one who honors the true God. He does not worship idols, so he will not be deceived or ridiculed.</p>
