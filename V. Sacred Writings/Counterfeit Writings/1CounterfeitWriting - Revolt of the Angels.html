        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">CONTAINING IN A FEW LINES THE HISTORY OF A FRENCH FAMILY 
          FROM 1789 TO THE PRESENT DAY </p>

          <p>
          BENEATH the shadow of St. Sulpice the ancient mansion of the d'Esparvieu family rears its austere three stories between a moss-grown fore-court and a garden hemmed in, as the years have elapsed, by ever loftier and more intrusive buildings, wherein, nevertheless, two tall chestnut trees still lift their withered heads. <br><br>
          
          Here from 1825 to 1857 dwelt the great man of the family, Alexandre 
          Bussart d'Esparvieu, Vice-President of the Council of State under the Government of July, Member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, and author of an Essay on the Civil and Religious Institutions of Nations, in three octavo volumes, a work unfortunately left incomplete. <br><br>
          
          This eminent theorist of a Liberal monarchy left as heir to his name his fortune and his fame, Fulgence-Adolphe Bussart d'Esparvieu, senator under the Second Empire, who added largely to his patrimony by buying land over which the Avenue de l'Impératice was destined ultimately to pass, and who made a remarkable speech in favour of the temporal power of the popes. <br><br>
          
          Fulgence had three sons.
          The eldest, Marc-Alexandre, entering the army, made a splendid career for himself: he was a good speaker. <br><br>
          
          The second, Gaétan, showing no particular aptitude for anything, lived mostly in the country, where he hunted, bred horses, and devoted himself to music and painting. <br><br>
          
          The third son, René, destined from his childhood for the law, resigned his deputyship to avoid complicity in the Ferry decrees against the religious orders; and later, perceiving the revival under the presidency of Monsieur Fallières of the days of Decius and Diocletian, put his knowledge and zeal at the service of the persecuted Church. <br><br>
          
          From the Concordat of 1801 down to the closing years of the Second Empire all the d'Esparvieus attended mass for the sake of example.
          Though sceptics in their inmost hearts, they looked upon religion as an instrument of government. <br><br>
          
          Mark and René were the first of their race to show any sign of sincere devotion. <br><br>
          
          The General, when still a colonel, had dedicated his regiment to the Sacred Heart, and he practised his faith with a fervour remarkable even in a soldier, though we all know that piety, daughter of Heaven, has marked out the hearts of the generals of the Third Republic as her chosen dwelling place on earth.<br><br>

          Faith has its vicissitudes. Under the old order the masses were believers, not so the aristocracy or the educated middle class. <br><br>
          
          Under the First Empire the army from top to bottom was entirely irreligious. <br><br>
          
          To-day the masses believe nothing. <br><br>
          
          The middle classes wish to believe, and succeed at times, as 
          did Marc and René d'Esparvieu. <br><br>
          
          Their brother Gaétan, on the contrary, the country gentleman, failed to attain to faith. <br><br>
          
          He was an agnostic, a term commonly employed by the modish to avoid the odious one of freethinker. <br><br>
          
          And he openly declared himself an agnostic, contrary to the admirable custom which deems it better to withhold the avowal. <br><br>
          
          In the century in which we live there are so many modes of belief and of unbelief that future historians will have difficulty in finding their way about. <br><br>
          
          But are we any more successful in disentangling the condition of religious beliefs in the time of Symmachus or of Ambrose? 
          A fervent Christian, René d'Esparvieu was deeply attached to the liberal ideas his ancestors had transmitted to him as a sacred heritage. <br><br>
          
          Compelled to oppose a Jacobin and atheistical Republic, he still called himself Republican. <br><br>
          
          And it was in the name of liberty that he demanded the independence and sovereignty of the Church. <br><br>
          
          During the long debates on the Separation and the quarrels over the 
          Inventories, the synods of the bishops and the assemblies of the faithful were held in his house. <br><br>
          
          While the most authoritatively accredited leaders of the Catholic party: prelates, generals, senators, deputies, journalists, were 
          met together in the big green drawing-room, and every soul present turned towards Rome with a tender submission or enforced obedience; while Monsieur d'Esparvieu, his elbow on the marble chimney-piece, opposed civil law to canon law, and protested eloquently against the spoliation of the Church of France, two faces of other days, immobile and speechless, looked down on the modern crowd; on the right of the fire-place, painted by David, was Romain Bussart, a working-farmer at Esparvieu in shirt-sleeves and drill trousers, with a rough-and-ready air not untouched with cunning. <br><br>
          
          He had good reason to smile: the worthy man laid the foundation of the family fortunes when he bought Church lands. <br><br>
          
          On the left, painted by Gérard in full-dress bedizened with orders, was the peasant's son, Baron Emile Bussart d'Esparvieu, prefect under the Empire, Keeper of the Great Seal under Charles X, who died in 1837, churchwarden of his parish, with couplets from La Pucelle on his lips. <br><br>
          
          René d'Esparvieu married in 1888 Marie-Antoinette Coupelle, daughter of Baron Coupelle, ironmaster at Blainville (Haute Loire). <br><br>
          
          Madame René d'Esparvieu had been president since 1903 of the Society of Christian Mothers. <br><br>
          
          These perfect spouses, having married off their eldest daughter in 
          1908, had three children still at home—a girl and two boys. <br><br>
          
          Léon, the younger, aged seven, had a room next to his mother and his sister Berthe. <br><br>
          
          Maurice, the elder, lived in a little pavilion comprising two rooms at the bottom of the garden. <br><br>
          
          The young man thus gained a freedom which enabled him to endure family life. <br><br>
          
          He was rather good-looking, smart without too much pretence, and the faint smile which merely raised one corner of his mouth did not lack charm. <br><br>
          
          At twenty-five Maurice possessed the wisdom of Ecclesiastes. <br><br>
          
          Doubting whether a man hath any profit of all his labour which he taketh under the sun he never put himself out about anything. <br><br>
          
          From his earliest childhood this young hopeful's sole concern with work had been considering how he might best avoid it, and it was through his remaining ignorant of the teaching of the École de Droit that he became a doctor of law and a barrister at the Court of Appeal. <br><br>
          
          He neither pleaded nor practised. <br><br>
          
          He had no knowledge and no desire to acquire any; wherein he conformed to his genius whose engaging fragility he forbore to overload; his instinct fortunately telling him that it was better to 
          understand little than to misunderstand a lot. <br><br>
          
          As Monsieur l'Abbé Patouille expressed it, Maurice had received from 
          Heaven the benefits of a Christian education. <br><br>
          
          From his childhood piety was shown to him in the example of his home, and when on leaving college he was entered at the École de Droit, he found the lore of the doctors, the virtues of the confessors, and the constancy of the nursing mothers of the 
          Church assembled around the paternal hearth. <br><br>
          
          Admitted to social and political life at the time of the great persecution of the Church of France, Maurice did not fail to attend every manifestation of youthful Catholicism; he lent a hand with his parish barricades at the time of the Inventories, and with his companions he unharnessed the archbishop's horses when he was 
          driven out from his palace. <br><br>
          
          He showed on all these occasions a modified zeal; one never saw him in the front ranks of the heroic band exciting soldiers to a glorious disobedience or flinging mud and curses at the agents 
          of the law. <br><br>
          
          He did his duty, nothing more; and if he distinguished himself on the occasion of the great pilgrimage of 1911 among the stretcher-bearers at Lourdes, we have reason to fear it was but to please Madame de la Verdelière, who admired men of muscle. <br><br>
          
          Abbé Patouille, a friend of the family and deeply versed in the knowledge of souls, knew that Maurice had only moderate aspirations to martyrdom. <br><br>
          
          He reproached him with his lukewarmness, and pulled his ear, calling him a bad lot. <br><br>
          
          Anyway, Maurice remained a believer. <br><br>
          
          Amid the distractions of youth his faith remained intact, since he left it severely alone. <br><br>
          
          He had never examined a single tenet. <br><br>
          
          Nor had he enquired a whit more closely into the ideas of morality current in the grade of society to which he belonged. <br><br>
          
          He took them just as they came. <br><br>
          
          Thus in every situation that arose he cut an eminently respectable figure which he would have assuredly failed to do, had he been given to meditating on the foundations of morality. <br><br>
          
          He was irritable and hot-tempered and possessed of a sense of 
          honour which he was at great pains to cultivate. <br><br>
          
          He was neither vain nor ambitious. <br><br>
          
          Like the majority of Frenchmen, he disliked parting with his 
          money. <br><br> 
          
          Women would never have obtained anything from him had they not 
          known the way to make him give. <br><br>
          
          He believed he despised them; the truth was he adored them. <br><br>
          
          He indulged his appetites so naturally that he never suspected that he had any. <br><br>
          
          What people did not know, himself least of all,— though the gleam that occasionally shone in his fine, light-brown eyes might 
          have furnished the hint—was that he had a warm heart and was capable of friendship. <br><br>
          
          For the rest, he was, in the ordinary intercourse of life, no very 
          brilliant specimen.</p>
          


        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN USEFUL INFORMATION WILL BE FOUND CONCERNING A LIBRARY WHERE STRANGE THINGS WILL SHORTLY COME TO PASS</p>

        <p>
          DESIROUS of embracing the whole circle of human knowledge, and anxious to bequeath to the world a concrete symbol of his encyclopædic genius and a display in keeping with his pecuniary resources, Baron Alexandre d'Esparvieu had formed a library of three hundred and sixty thousand volumes, both printed and in manuscript, whereof the greater part emanated from the Benedictines of Ligugé. <br><br>
          

          By a special clause in his will he enjoined his heirs to add to his library, after his death, whatever they might deem worthy of note in natural, moral, political, philosophical, and religious science. <br><br>
          

          He had indicated the sums which might be drawn from his estate for the fulfilment of this object, and charged his eldest son, Fulgence-Adolphe, to 
          proceed with these additions. <br><br>
          
          Fulgence-Adolphe accomplished with filial respect the wishes expressed by his illustrious father. <br><br>
          

          After him, this huge library, which represented more than one child's share of the estate, remained undivided between the Senator's three sons and two daughters; and René d'Esparvieu, on whom devolved the house in the Rue Garancière, became the guardian of the valuable collection. <br><br>
          
          His two sisters, Madame Paulet de Saint-Fain and Madame Cuissart, repeatedly demanded that such a large but unremunerative piece of property should be turned into money. <br><br>
          
          But René and Gaétan bought in the shares of their two colegatees, and the library was saved. <br><br>
          
          René d'Esparvieu even busied himself in adding to it, thus fulfilling the intentions of its founder. <br><br>
          
          But from year to year he lessened the number and importance of the acquisitions, opining that the intellectual output in Europe was on the wane. <br><br>
          
          Nevertheless, Gaétan enriched it, out of his funds, with works published both in France and abroad which he thought good, and he was not lacking in judgment, though his brothers would never allow that he had a particle. <br><br>
          
          Thanks to this man of leisurely and inquiring mind, Baron Alexandre's collection was kept practically up to date. <br><br>
          
          Even at the present day the d'Esparvieu library, in the departments of theology, jurisprudence, and history is one of the finest private libraries in all Europe. <br><br>
          
          Here you may study physical science, or to put it better, physical sciences in all their branches, and for that matter metaphysic or metaphysics, that is to say, all that is connected with physics and has no other name, so impossible is it to designate by a substantive that which has no substance, and is but a dream and an illusion. <br><br>
          
          Here you may contemplate with admiration philosophers addressing themselves to the solution, dissolution, and resolution of the 
          Absolute, to the determination of the Indeterminate and to the definition of the Infinite. <br><br>
          
          Amid this pile of books and booklets, both sacred and profane, you may find everything down to the latest and most fashionable pragmatism. <br><br>
          

          Other libraries there are, more richly abounding in bindings of venerable antiquity and illustrious origin, whose smooth and soft-hued texture render them delicious to the touch; bindings which the gilder's art has enriched with gossamer, lace-work, foliage, flowers, emblematic devices, and coats of arms; bindings that charm the studious eye with their tender radiance. <br><br>
          
         Other libraries perhaps harbour a greater array of manuscripts illuminated with delicate and brilliant miniatures by artists of Venice, Flanders, or Touraine. <br><br>
          
          But in handsome, sound editions of ancient and modern writers, 
          both sacred and profane, the d'Esparvieu library is second to none. <br><br>
          
          Here one finds all that has come down to us from antiquity; all the Fathers of the Church, the Apologists and the Decretalists, all the Humanists of the Renaissance, all the Encylopædists, the whole world of philosophy and science. <br><br>
          
          Therefore it was that Cardinal Merlin, when he deigned to visit it, 
          remarked: "There is no man whose brain is equal to containing all the knowledge which is piled upon these shelves. <br><br>
          
          Happily it doesn't matter. <br><br>
          
          Monseigneur Cachepot, who worked there often when a curate in Paris, was in the habit of saying: "I see here the stuff to make many a Thomas Aquinas and many an Arius, if only the modern mind had not lost its ancient ardour for good and evil. <br><br>
          
          
          There was no gainsaying that the manuscripts formed the more valuable portion of this immense collection. <br><br>
          
          Noteworthy indeed was the unpublished correspondence of Gassendi, of Father Mersenne, and of Pascal, which threw a new light on the spirit of the seventeenth century. <br><br>
          
          Nor must we forget the Hebrew Bibles, the Talmuds, the Rabbinical treatises, printed and in manuscript, the Aramaic and Samaritan texts, on sheepskin and on tablets of sycamore; in fine, all these antique and valuable copies collected in Egypt and in Syria by the celebrated Moïse de Dina, and acquired at a small cost by Alexandre d'Esparvieu in 1836, when the learned Hebraist died of old age and poverty in Paris. <br><br>
          

          The Esparvienne library occupied the whole of the second floor of the old house. <br><br>
          
          The works thought to be of but mediocre interest, such as books of 
          Protestant exegesis of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the gift of Monsieur Gaétan, were relegated unbound to the limbo of the upper regions. <br><br>
          

          The catalogue, with its various supplements, ran into no less than eighteen folio volumes. <br><br>
          
          It was quite up to date, and the library was in perfect order. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Julien Sariette, archivist and palæographer, who, being poor and retiring, used to make his living by teaching, became, in 1895, tutor to young Maurice on the recommendation of the Bishop of Agra, and with scarcely an interval found himself curator of the Bibliothèque Esparvienne. <br><br>
          

          Endowed with business-like energy and dogged patience, Monsieur Sariette himself classified all the members of this vast body. <br><br>
          
          The system he invented and put into practice was so complicated, the labels he put on the books were made up of so many capital letters and small letters, both Latin and Greek, so many Arabic and Roman numerals, asterisks, double asterisks, triple asterisks, and those signs which in arithmetic express powers and roots, that the mere study of it would have involved more time and labour than would have been required for the complete mastery of algebra, and as 
          no one could be found who would give the hours, that might be more 
          profitably employed in discovering the law of numbers, to the solving of these cryptic symbols, Monsieur Sariette remained the only one capable of finding his way among the intricacies of his system, and without his help it had become an utter impossibility to discover, among the three hundred and sixty thousand volumes confided to his care, the particular volume one happened to require. <br><br>
          
          Such was the result of his labours. <br><br>
          
          Far from complaining about it, he experienced on the contrary a lively satisfaction. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette loved his library. <br><br>
          
          He loved it with a jealous love. <br><br>
          
          He was there every day at seven o'clock in the morning busy cataloguing at a huge mahogany desk. <br><br>
          
          The slips in his handwriting filled an enormous case standing by his side surmounted by a plaster bust of Alexandre d'Esparvieu. <br><br>
          

          Alexandre wore his hair brushed straight back, and had a sublime look on his face. <br><br>
          
          Like Chateaubriand, he affected little feathery side whiskers. <br><br>
          
          His lips were pursed, his bosom bare. <br><br>
          
          Punctually at midday Monsieur Sariette used to sally forth to lunch at a crèmerie in the narrow gloomy Rue des Canettes. <br><br>
          
          It was known as the Crèmerie des Quatre Évêques, and had once 
          been the haunt of Baudelaire, Theodore de Banville, Charles Asselineau, and a certain grandee of Spain who had translated the "Mysteries of Paris" into the language of the conquistadores. <br><br>
          
          And the ducks that paddled so nicely on the old stone sign which gave its name to the street used to recognize Monsieur Sariette. <br><br>
          
          At a quarter to one, to the very minute, he went back to his library, where he remained until seven o'clock. <br><br>
          
          He then again betook himself to the Quatre Évêques, and sat down to his frugal dinner, with its crowning glory of stewed prunes. <br><br>
          
          Every evening, after dinner, his crony, Monsieur Guinardon, universally known as Père Guinardon, a scene painter and picture-restorer, who used to do work for churches, would come 
          from his garret in the Rue Princesse to have his coffee and liqueur at the Quatre Évêques, and the two friends would play their game of dominoes. <br><br>
          
          Old Guinardon, who was like some rugged old tree still full of sap, was older than he could bring himself to believe. <br><br>
          
          He had known Chenavard. <br><br>
          
          His chastity was positively ferocious, and he was for ever denouncing the impurities of neo-paganism in language of alarming obscenity. <br><br>
          
          He loved talking. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette was a ready listener. <br><br>
          
          Old Guinardon's favourite subject was the Chapelle des Anges in St. <br><br>
          
          Sulpice, in which the paintings were peeling off the walls, and which he was one day to restore; when, that is, it should please God, for, since the Separation, the churches belonged solely to God, and no one would undertake the responsibility of even the most urgent repairs. <br><br>
          
          But old Guinardon demanded no salary. <br><br>
          

          "Michael is my patron saint," he said. <br><br>
          
          "And I have a special devotion for the Holy Angels. <br><br>
          
          
          After they had had their game of dominoes, Monsieur Sariette, very thin and small, and old Guinardon, sturdy as an oak, hirsute as a lion, and tall as a Saint Christopher, went off chatting away side by side across the Place Saint Sulpice, heedless of whether the night were fine or stormy. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette always went straight home, much to the regret of the painter, who was a gossip and a nightbird. <br><br>
          
          The following day, as the clock struck seven, Monsieur Sariette would take up his place in the library, and resume his cataloguing. <br><br>
          
          As he sat at his desk, however, he would dart a Medusa-like look at anyone who entered, fearing lest he should prove to be a book-borrower. <br><br>
          
          It was not merely the magistrates, politicians, and prelates whom he would have liked to turn to stone when they came to ask for the loan of a book with an air of authority bred of their familiarity with the master of the house. <br><br>
          
          He would have done as much to Monsieur Gaétan, the library's benefactor, when he wanted some gay or scandalous old volume wherewith to beguile a wet day in the country. <br><br>
          
          He would have meted out similar treatment to Madame René d'Esparvieu, when she came to look for a book to read to her sick poor in hospital, and even to Monsieur René d'Esparvieu himself, who generally contented himself with the Civil Code and a volume of Dalloz. <br><br>
          
          The borrowing of the smallest book seemed like dragging his heart out. <br><br>
          
          To refuse a volume even to such as had the most incontestable right to it, Monsieur Sariette would invent countless far-fetched or clumsy fibs, and did not even shrink from slandering himself as curator or from casting doubts on his own vigilance by saying that such and such a book was mislaid or lost, when a moment ago he had been gloating over that very volume or pressing it to his bosom. <br><br>
          
          And when ultimately forced to part with a volume he would take it back a score of times from the borrower before he finally relinquished it. <br><br>
          
          He was always in agony lest one of the objects confided to his care should escape him. <br><br>
          
          As the guardian of three hundred and sixty thousand volumes, 
          he had three hundred and sixty thousand reasons for alarm. <br><br>
          
          Sometimes he woke at night bathed in sweat, and uttering a cry of fear, because he had dreamed he had seen a gap on one of the shelves of his bookcases. <br><br>
          
          It seemed to him a monstrous, unheard-of, and most grievous thing that a volume should leave its habitat. <br><br>
          
          This noble rapacity exasperated Monsieur René d'Esparvieu, who, failing to understand the good qualities of his paragon of a librarian, called him an old maniac. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette knew nought of this injustice, but he would have braved the cruellest misfortune and endured opprobrium and insult to safeguard the integrity of his trust. <br><br>
          
          Thanks to his assiduity, his vigilance and zeal, or, in a word, to his love, the Esparvienne library had not lost so much as a single leaflet under his supervision during the sixteen years which had now rolled by, this ninth of September, 1912. <br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN THE MYSTERY BEGINS</p>

        <p>
          AT seven o'clock on the evening of that day, having as usual replaced all the books which had been taken from their shelves, and having assured himself that he was leaving everything in good order, he quitted the library, double locking the door after him. <br><br>
          
          According to his usual habit, he dined at the Crèmerie des Quatre Évêques, read his newspaper, La Croix, and at ten o'clock went home to his little house in the Rue du Regard. <br><br>
          
          The good man had no trouble and no presentiment of evil; his sleep was peaceful. <br><br>
          
          The next morning at seven o'clock to the minute, he entered the little room leading to the library, and, according to his daily habit, doffed his grand frock-coat, and taking down an old one which hung in a cupboard over his washstand, put it on. <br><br>
          
          Then he went in to his workroom, where for sixteen years he had 
          been cataloguing six days out of the seven, under the lofty gaze of Alexandre d'Esparvieu. <br><br>
          
          Preparing to make a round of the various rooms, he entered the 
          first and largest, which contained works on theology and religion in huge cupboards whose cornices were adorned with bronze-coloured busts of poets and orators of ancient days. <br><br>
          

          Two enormous globes representing the earth and the heavens filled the window-embrasures. <br><br>
          
          But at his first step Monsieur Sariette stopped dead, stupefied, powerless alike to doubt or to credit what his eyes beheld. <br><br>
          
          On the blue cloth cover of the writing-table books lay scattered about pell-mell, some lying flat, some standing upright. <br><br>
          
          A number of quartos were heaped up in a tottering pile. <br><br>
          
          Two Greek lexicons, one inside the other, formed a single being more monstrous in shape than the human couples of the divine Plato. <br><br>
          
          A gilt-edged folio was all a-gape, showing three of its leaves disgracefully dog's-eared. <br><br>
          
          Having, after an interval of some moments, recovered from his profound amazement, the librarian went up to the table and recognised in the confused mass his most valuable Hebrew, French, and Latin Bibles, a unique Talmud, Rabbinical treatises printed and in manuscript, Aramaic and Samaritan texts and scrolls from the synagogues—in fine, the most precious relics of Israel all lying in a disordered heap, gaping and crumpled. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette found himself confronted with an inexplicable 
          phenomenon; nevertheless he sought to account for it. <br><br>
          
          How eagerly he would have welcomed the idea that Monsieur Gaétan, who, being a thoroughly unprincipled man, presumed on the right gained him by his fatal liberality towards the library to rummage there unhindered during his sojourns in Paris, had been the author of this terrible disorder. <br><br>
          
          But Monsieur Gaétan was away travelling in Italy. <br><br>
          
          After pondering for some minutes Monsieur Sariette's next supposition was that Monsieur René d'Esparvieu had entered the library late in the evening with the keys of his manservant Hippolyte, who, for the past twenty-five years, had looked after 
          the second floor and the attics. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur René d'Esparvieu, however, never worked at night, and did not read Hebrew. <br><br>
          
          Perhaps, thought Monsieur Sariette, perhaps he had brought or allowed to be brought to this room some priest, or Jerusalem monk, on his way through Paris; some Oriental savant given to scriptural exegesis. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette next wondered whether the Abbé Patouille, who had an enquiring mind, and also a habit of dog's-earing his books, had, peradventure, flung himself on these talmudic and biblical texts, fired with sudden zeal to lay bare the soul of Shem. <br><br>
          
          He even asked himself for a moment whether Hippolyte, the old manservant, who had swept and dusted the library for a quarter of a century, and had been slowly poisoned by the dust of accumulated knowledge, had allowed his curiosity to get the better of him, and had been there during the night, ruining his eyesight and his reason, and losing his soul poring by moonlight over these          undecipherable symbols. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette even went so far as to imagine that young Maurice, on leaving his club or some nationalist meeting, might have torn these Jewish volumes from their shelves, out of hatred for old 
          Jacob and his modern posterity; for this young man of family was a declared anti-semite, and only consorted with those Jews who were as anti-semitic as himself. <br><br>
          
          It was giving a very free rein to his imagination, but Monsieur 
          Sariette's brain could not rest, and went wandering about among 
          speculations of the wildest extravagance. <br><br>
          
          Impatient to know the truth, the zealous guardian of the library called the manservant. <br><br>
          

          Hippolyte knew nothing. <br><br>
          
          The porter at the lodge could not furnish any clue. <br><br>
          
          None of the domestics had heard a sound. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette went down to the study of Monsieur René d'Esparvieu, who received him in nightcap and dressing-gown, listened to his story with the air of a serious man bored with 
          idle chatter, and dismissed him with words which conveyed a cruel 
          implication of pity. <br><br>
          
          "Do not worry, my good Monsieur Sariette; be sure that the books were lying where you left them last night. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette reiterated his enquiries a score of times, discovered nothing, and suffered such anxiety that sleep entirely forsook him. <br><br>
          
          When, on the following day at seven o'clock he entered the room with the busts and globes, and saw that all was in order, he heaved a sigh of relief. <br><br>
          
          Then suddenly his heart beat fit to burst. <br><br>
          
          He had just seen lying flat on the mantelpiece a paper-bound volume, a modern work, the boxwood paper knife which had served to cut its pages still thrust between the leaves. <br><br>
          
          It was a dissertation on the two parallel versions of Genesis, a work which Monsieur Sariette had relegated to the attic, and which had never left it up to now, no one in Monsieur d'Esparvieu's circle having had the curiosity to differentiate between the parts for which the polytheistic and monotheistic contributors were respectively responsible in the formation of the first of the 
          sacred books. <br><br>
          
          This book bore the label R > 3214VIII/2. <br><br>
          
          And this painful truth was suddenly borne in upon the mind of Monsieur Sariette: to wit, that the most scientific system of numbering will not help to find a book if the book is no longer in its place. <br><br>
          
          Every day of the ensuing month found the table littered with books. <br><br>
          
          Greek and Latin lay cheek by jowl with Hebrew. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette asked himself whether these nocturnal flittings were the work of evil-doers who entered by the skylights to steal valuable and precious volumes. <br><br>
          
          But he found no traces of burglary, and, notwithstanding 
          the most minute search, failed to discover that anything had disappeared. <br><br>
          
          Terrible anxiety took possession of his mind, and he fell to wondering whether it was possible that some monkey in the neighbourhood came down the chimney and acted the part of a person engaged in study. <br><br>
          
          Deriving his knowledge of the habits of these animals in the main from the paintings of Watteau and Chardin, he took it that, in the art of imitating gestures or assuming characters they resembled Harlequin, Scaramouch, Zerlin, and the Doctors of the Italian comedy; he imagined them handling a palette and brushes, pounding drugs in a mortar, or turning over the leaves of an old treatise on alchemy beside an athanor. <br><br>
          
          And so it was that, when, on one unhappy morning, he saw a huge blot of ink on one of the leaves of the third volume of the polyglot Bible bound in blue morocco and adorned with the arms of the Comte de Mirabeau, he had no doubt that a monkey was the author of the evil deed. <br><br>
          
          The monkey had been pretending to take notes and had upset the inkpot. <br><br>
          
          It must be a monkey belonging to a learned professor. <br><br>
          
          Imbued with this idea, Monsieur Sariette carefully studied the topography of the district, so as to draw a cordon round the group of houses amid which the d'Esparvieu house stood. <br><br>
          
          Then he visited the four surrounding streets, asking at every door if there was a monkey in the house. <br><br>
          
          He interrogated porters and their wives, washer-women, servants, a cobbler, a greengrocer, a glazier, clerks in bookshops, a priest, a bookbinder, twoguardians of the peace, children, thus testing the diversity of character and variety of temper in one and the same people; for the replies he received were quite dissimilar in nature; some were rough, some were gentle; there were the coarse and 
          the polished, the simple and the ironical, the prolix and the abrupt, the brief and even the silent. <br><br>
          
          But of the animal he sought he had had neither sight nor sound, when under the archway of an old house in the Rue Servandoni, 
          a small freckled, red-haired girl who looked after the door, made reply: "There is Monsieur Ordonneau's monkey; would you care to see it?" And without another word she conducted the old man to a stable at the other end of the yard. <br><br>
          
          There on some rank straw and old bits of cloth, a young macaco with a chain round his middle sat and shivered. <br><br>
          
          He was no taller than a five-year-old child. <br><br>
          
          His livid face, his wrinkled brow, his thin lips were all expressive of mortal sadness. <br><br>
          
          He fixed on the visitor the still lively gaze of his yellow eyes. <br><br>
          
          Then with his small dry hand he seized a carrot, put it to his mouth, and forthwith flung it away. <br><br>
          
          Having looked at the newcomers for a moment, the exile turned away his head, as if he expected nothing further of mankind or of life. <br><br>
          
          Sitting huddled up, one knee in his hand, he made no further movement, but at times a dry cough shook his breast. <br><br>
          

          "It's Edgar," said the small girl. <br><br>
          
          "He is for sale, you know. <br><br>
          
          But the old book-lover, who had come armed with anger and resentment, thinking to find a cynical enemy, a monster of malice, an antibibliophile, stopped short, surprised, saddened, and overcome, before this little being devoid of strength and joy and hope. <br><br>
          
          Recognising his mistake, troubled by the almost human face which sorrow and suffering made more human still, he murmured "Forgive me" and bowed his head. <br><br>
          
        </p>



        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHICH IN ITS FORCEFUL BREVITY PROJECTS US TO THE LIMITS OF THE ACTUAL WORLD </p>

        <p>
          TWO months elapsed; the domestic upheaval did not subside, and Monsieur Sariette's thoughts turned to the Freemasons. <br><br>
          
          The papers he read were full of their crimes. <br><br>
          
          Abbé Patouille deemed them capable of the darkest deeds, 
          and believed them to be in league with the Jews and meditating the total overthrow of Christendom. <br><br>
          
          
          Having now arrived at the acme of power, they wielded a dominating 
          influence in all the principal departments of State, they ruled the Chambers, there were five of them in the Ministry, and they filled the Élysée. <br><br>
          
          Having some time since assassinated a President of the Republic because he was a patriot, they were getting rid of the accomplices and witnesses of their 
          execrable crime. <br><br>
          
          Few days passed without Paris being terror-stricken at 
          some mysterious murder hatched in their Lodges. <br><br>
          
          These were facts 
          concerning which no doubt was possible. <br><br>
          
          By what means did they gain 
          access to the library? Monsieur Sariette could not imagine. <br><br>
          
          What task had 
          they come to fulfil? Why did they attack sacred antiquity and the origins of 
          the Church? What impious designs were they forming? A heavy shadow 
          hung over these terrible undertakings. <br><br>
          
          The Catholic archivist feeling himself 
          under the eye of the sons of Hiram was terrified and fell ill. <br><br>
          
          
          Scarcely had he recovered, when he resolved to pass the night in the very 
          spot where these terrible mysteries were enacted, and to take the subtle and 
          dangerous visitors by surprise. <br><br>
          
          It was an enterprise that demanded all his 
          slender courage. <br><br>
          
          Being a man of delicate physique and of nervous 
          temperament, Monsieur Sariette was naturally inclined to be fearful. <br><br>
          
          On the 
          8th of January at nine o'clock in the evening, while the city lay asleep under 
          a whirling snowstorm, he built up a good fire in the room containing the 
          busts of the ancient poets and philosophers, and ensconced himself in an 
          arm-chair at the chimney corner, a rug over his knees. <br><br>
          
          On a small stand 
          within reach of his hand were a lamp, a bowl of black coffee, and a revolver 
          borrowed from the youthful Maurice. <br><br>
          
          He tried to read his paper, La Croix, 
          but the letters danced beneath his eyes. <br><br>
          
          So he stared hard in front of him, 
          saw nothing but the shadows, heard nothing but the wind, and fell asleep. <br><br>
          
          
          When he awoke the fire was out, the lamp was extinguished, leaving an 
          acrid smell behind. <br><br>
          
          But all around, the darkness was filled with milky 
          brightness and phosphorescent lights. <br><br>
          
          He thought he saw something flutter 
          on the table. <br><br>
          
          Stricken to the marrow with cold and terror, but upheld by a 
          resolve stronger than any fear, he rose, approached the table, and passed 
          his hands over the cloth. <br><br>
          
          He saw nothing; even the lights faded, but under 
          his fingers he felt a folio wide open; he tried to close it, the book resisted, 
          jumped up and hit the imprudent librarian three blows on the head. 
          Monsieur Sariette fell down unconscious.... <br><br>
          
          
          Since then things had gone from bad to worse. <br><br>
          
          Books left their allotted 
          shelves in greater profusion than ever, and sometimes it was impossible to 
          replace them; they disappeared. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur Sariette discovered fresh losses 
          daily. <br><br>
          
          The Bollandists were now an imperfect set, thirty volumes of exegesis 
          were missing. <br><br>
          
          He himself had become unrecognisable. <br><br>
          
           His face had shrunk 
          to the size of one's fist and grown yellow as a lemon, his neck was elongated 
          out of all proportion, his shoulders drooped, the clothes he wore hung on 
          him as on a peg. <br><br>
          
          He ate nothing, and at the Crèmerie des Quatre Évêques he 
          would sit with dull eyes and bowed head, staring fixedly and vacantly at the 
          saucer where, in a muddy juice, floated his stewed prunes. <br><br>
          
          He did not hear 
          old Guinardon relate how he had at last begun to restore the Delacroix 
          paintings at St. Sulpice. 
          Monsieur René d'Esparvieu, when he heard the unhappy curator's alarming 
          reports, used to answer drily: 
          "These books have been mislaid, they are not lost; look carefully, Monsieur 
          Sariette, look carefully and you will find them." 
          And he murmured behind the old man's back: 
          "Poor old Sariette is in a bad way." 
          "I think," replied Abbé Patouille, "that his brain is going."
        </p>


        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN EVERYTHING SEEMS STRANGE BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS LOGICAL</p>

        <p>
          THE Chapel of the Holy Angels, which lies on the right hand as you enter 
          the Church of St. Sulpice, was hidden behind a scaffolding of planks. Abbé 
          Patouille, Monsieur Gaétan, Monsieur Maurice, his nephew, and Monsieur 
          Sariette, entered in single file through the low door cut in the wooden 
          hoarding, and found old Guinardon on the top of his ladder standing in 
          front of the Heliodorus. <br><br>
          
          The old artist, surrounded by all sorts of tools and 
          materials, was putting a white paste in the crack which cut in two the High 
          Priest Onias. <br><br>
          
          Zéphyrine, Paul Baudry's favourite model, Zéphyrine, who had 
          lent her golden hair and polished shoulders to so many Magdalens, 
          Marguerites, sylphs, and mermaids, and who, it is said, was beloved of the 
          Emperor Napoleon III, was standing at the foot of the ladder with tangled 
          locks, cadaverous cheeks, and dim eyes, older than old Guinardon, whose 
          life she had shared for more than half a century. <br><br>
          
          She had brought the 
          painter's lunch in a basket. <br><br>
          
          
          Although the slanting rays fell grey and cold through the leaded and iron
          barred window, Delacroix's colouring shone resplendent, and the roses on 
          the cheeks of men and angels dimmed with their glorious beauty the 
          rubicund countenance of old Guinardon, which stood out in relief against 
          one of the temple's columns. <br><br>
          
          These frescoes of the Chapel of the Holy 
          Angels, though derided and insulted when they first appeared, have now 
          become part of the classic tradition, and are united in immortality with the 
          masterpieces of Rubens and Tintoretto. <br><br>
          
          
          Old Guinardon, bearded and long-haired, looked like Father Time effacing 
          the works of man's genius. <br><br>
          
          Gaétan, in alarm, called out to him: 
          "Carefully, Monsieur Guinardon, carefully. <br><br>
          
          Do not scrape too much. <br><br>
          
           " 
          The painter reassured him. <br><br>
          
          
          "Fear nothing, Monsieur Gaétan. <br><br>
          
          I do not paint in that style. <br><br>
          
           My art is a 
          higher one. <br><br>
          
          I work after the manner of Cimabue, Giotto, and Beato Angelico, 
          not in the style of Delacroix. <br><br>
          
          This surface here is too heavily charged with 
          contrast and opposition to give a really sacred effect. <br><br>
          
          It is true that 
          Chenavard said that Christianity loves the picturesque, but Chenavard was 
          a rascal with neither faith nor principle—an infidel.... <br><br>
          
           Look, Monsieur 
          d'Esparvieu, I fill up the crevice, I relay the scales of paint which are peeling. <br><br>

          That is all.... The damage, due to the sinking of the wall, or more probably to 
          a seismic shock, is confined to a very small space. This painting of oil and 
          wax applied on a very dry foundation is far more solid than one might think. <br><br>
          
          
          "I saw Delacroix engaged on this work. <br><br>
          
          Impassioned but anxious, he 
          modelled feverishly, scraped out, re-painted unceasingly; his mighty hand 
          made childish blunders, but the thing is done with the mastery of a genius 
          and the inexperience of a schoolboy. <br><br>
          
          It is a marvel how it holds." <br><br>
          
            
          The good man was silent, and went on filling in the crevice. <br><br>
          
          
          "How classic and traditional the composition is," said Gaétan. <br><br>
          
          "Time was 
          when one could recognise nothing but its amazing novelty; now one can see 
          in it a multitude of old Italian formulas." <br><br>
          "I may allow myself the luxury of being just, I possess the qualifications," 
          said the old man from the top of his lofty ladder. "Delacroix lived in a 
          blasphemous and godless age. <br><br>
          
          A painter of the decadence, he was not 
          without pride nor grandeur. <br><br>
          
          He was greater than his times. <br><br>
          
           But he lacked 
          faith, single-heartedness, and purity. <br><br>
          
          To be able to see and paint angels he 
          needed that virtue of angels and primitives, that supreme virtue which, with 
          God's help, I do my best to practise, chastity." <br><br> 
          "Hold your tongue, Michel; you are as big a brute as any of them." <br><br>

          Thus Zéphyrine, devoured with jealousy because that very morning on the 
          stairs she had seen her lover kiss the bread-woman's daughter, to wit the 
          youthful Octavie, who was as squalid and radiant as one of Rembrandt's 
          Brides. <br><br>
          
          She had loved Michel madly in the happy days long since past, and 
          love had never died out in Zéphyrine's heart. <br><br>
          
          
          Old Guinardon received the flattering insult with a smile that he dissembled, 
          and raised his eyes to the ceiling, where the archangel Michael, terrible in 
          azure cuirass and gilt helmet, was springing heavenwards in all the radiance 
          of his glory. <br><br>
          
          
          Meanwhile Abbé Patouille, blinking, and shielding his eyes with his hat 
          against the glaring light from the window, began to examine the pictures one 
          after another: Heliodorus being scourged by the angels, St. Michael 
          vanquishing the Demons, and the combat of Jacob and the Angel. <br><br>
          
          
          "All this is exceedingly fine," he murmured at last, "but why has the artist 
          only represented wrathful angels on these walls? Look where I will in this 
          chapel, I see but heralds of celestial anger, ministers of divine vengeance. <br><br>
          
          
          God wishes to be feared; He wishes also to be loved. <br><br>
          
          I would fain perceive on 
          these walls messengers of peace and of clemency. <br><br>
          
          I should like to see the 
          Seraphim who purified the lips of the prophet, St. Raphael who gave back 
          his sight to old Tobias, Gabriel who announced the Mystery of the 
          Incarnation to Mary, the Angel who delivered St. Peter from his chains, the 
          Cherubim who bore the dead St. Catherine to the top of Sinai. <br><br>
          
          Above all, I 
          should like to be able to contemplate those heavenly guardians which God 
          gives to every man baptized in His name. <br><br>
          
          We each have one who follows all 
          our steps, who comforts us and upholds us. <br><br>
          
          It would be pleasant indeed to 
          admire these enchanting spirits, these beautiful faces." 
          "Ah, Abbé! it depends on the point of view," answered Gaétan. <br><br>
          
          "Delacroix 
          was no sentimentalist. <br><br>
          
          Old Ingres was not very far wrong in saying that this 
          great man's work reeks of fire and brimstone. <br><br>
          
          Look at the sombre, splendid 
          beauty of those angels, look at those androgynes so proud and fierce, at 
          those pitiless youths who lift avenging rods against Heliodorus, note this 
          mysterious wrestler touching the patriarch on the hip...." <br><br>
          "Hush," said Abbé Patouille. <br><br>
          
          "According to the Bible he is no angel like the 
          others; if he be an angel, he is the Angel of Creation, the Eternal Son of God. <br><br>
          
          
          I am surprised that the Venerable Curé of St. <br><br>
          
          Sulpice, who entrusted the 
          decoration of this chapel to Monsieur Eugène Delacroix, did not tell him that 
          the patriarch's symbolic struggle with Him who was nameless took place in 
          profound darkness, and that the subject is quite out of place here, since it 
          prefigures the Incarnation of Jesus Christ. <br><br>
          
          The best artists go astray when 
          they fail to obtain their ideas of Christian iconography from a qualified 
          ecclesiastic. <br><br>
          
          The institutions of Christian art form the subject of numerous 
          works with which you are doubtless acquainted, Monsieur Sariette."<br><br>
          
           
          Monsieur Sariette was gazing vacantly about him. <br><br>
          
          It was the third morning 
          after his adventurous night in the library. <br><br>
          
          Being, however, thus called upon 
          by the venerable ecclesiastic, he pulled himself together and replied: 
          "On this subject we may with advantage consult Molanus, De Historia 
          Sacrarum Imaginum et Picturarum, in the edition given us by Noël Paquot, 
          dated Louvain, 1771; Cardinal Frederico Borromeo, De Pictura Sacra, and 
          the Iconography of Didron; but this last work must be read with caution." <br><br>
          
           
          Having thus spoken, Monsieur Sariette relapsed into silence. <br><br>
          
          He was 
          pondering on his devastated library. <br><br>
          
          
          "On the other hand," continued Abbé Patouille, "since an example of the holy 
          anger of the angels was necessary in this chapel, the painter is to be 
          commended for having depicted for us in imitation of Raphael the heavenly 
          messengers who chastised Heliodorus. <br><br>
          
          Ordered by Seleucus, King of Syria, 
          to carry off the treasures contained in the Temple, Heliodorus was stricken 
          by an angel in a cuirass of gold mounted on a magnificently caparisoned 
          steed. <br><br>
          
          Two other angels smote him with rods. <br><br>
          
           He fell to earth, as Monsieur 
          Delacroix shows us here, and was swallowed up in darkness. <br><br>
          
          It is right and 
          salutary that this adventure should be cited as an example to the 
          Republican Commissioners of Police and to the sacrilegious agents of the 
          law. <br><br>
          
          There will always be Heliodoruses, but, let it be known, every time they 
          lay their hands on the property of the Church, which is the property of the 
          poor, they shall be chastised with rods and blinded by the angels." <br><br> 
          "I should like this painting, or, better still, Raphael's sublimer conception of 
          the same subject, to be engraved in little pictures fully coloured, and 
          distributed as rewards in all the schools."<br><br> 
          "Uncle," said young Maurice, with a yawn, "I think these things are simply 
          ghastly. I prefer Matisse and Metzinger." <br><br>
          These words fell unheeded, and old Guinardon from his ladder held forth: 
          "Only the primitives caught a glimpse of Heaven.<br><br>
          
          Beauty is only to be found 
          between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries. <br><br>
          
          The antique, the impure 
          antique, which regained its pernicious influence over the minds of the 
          sixteenth century, inspired poets and painters with criminal notions and 
          immodest conceptions, with horrid impurities, filth. <br><br>
          
          All the artists of the 
          Renaissance were swine, including Michael-Angelo." <br><br>

          Then, perceiving that Gaétan was on the point of departure, Père Guinardon 
          assumed an air of bonhomie, and said to him in a confidential tone: 
          "Monsieur Gaétan, if you're not afraid of climbing up my five flights, come 
          and have a look at my den. <br><br>
          
          I've got two or three little canvases I wouldn't 
          mind parting with, and they might interest you. <br><br>
          
          All good, honest, 
          straightforward stuff. <br><br>
          
          I'll show you, among other things, a tasty, spicy little 
          Baudouin that would make your mouth water." <br><br>
          
           
          At this speech Gaétan made off. As he descended the church steps and 
          turned down the Rue Princesse, he found himself accompanied by old 
          Sariette, and fell to unburdening himself to him, as he would have done to 
          any human creature, or indeed to a tree, a lamp-post, a dog, or his own 
          shadow, of the indignation with which the æsthetic theories of the old 
          painter inspired him. <br><br>
          
          
          "Old Guinardon overdoes it with his Christian art and his Primitives! 
          Whatever the artist conceives of Heaven is borrowed from earth; God, the 
          Virgin, the Angels, men and women, saints, the light, the clouds. <br><br>
          
          When he 
          was designing figures for the chapel windows at Dreux, old Ingres drew from 
          life a pure, fine study of a woman, which may be seen, among many others, 
          in the Musée Bonnat at Bayonne. <br><br>
          
          Old Ingres had written at the bottom of 
          the page in case he should forget: 'Mademoiselle Cécile, admirable legs and 
          thighs'—and so as to make Mademoiselle Cécile into a saint in Paradise, he 
          gave her a robe, a cloak, a veil, inflicting thus a shameful decline in her 
          estate, for the tissues of Lyons and Genoa are worthless compared with the 
          youthful living tissue, rosy with pure blood; the most beautiful draperies are 
          despicable compared with the lines of a beautiful body. <br><br>
          
          In fact, clothing for 
          flesh that is desirable and ripe for wedlock is an unmerited shame, and the 
          worst of humiliations"; and Gaétan, walking carelessly in the gutter of the 
          Rue Garancière, continued: "Old Guinardon is a pestilential idiot. <br><br>
          
          He 
          blasphemes Antiquity, sacred Antiquity, the age when the gods were kind. <br><br>
          
          
          He exalts an epoch when the painter and the sculptor had all their lessons 
          to learn over again. <br><br>
          
          In point of fact, Christianity has run contrary to art in 
          so much as it has not favoured the study of the nude. <br><br>
          
          Art is the 
          representation of nature, and nature is pre-eminently the human body; it is 
          the nude." <br><br>

          "Pardon, pardon," purred old Sariette. <br><br>
          
          "There is such a thing as spiritual, or, 
          as one might term it, inward beauty, which, since the days of Fra Angelico 
          down to those of Hippolyte Flandrin, Christian art has—" 
          But Gaétan, never hearing a word of all this, went on hurling his impetuous 
          observations at the stones of the old street and the snow-laden clouds 
          overhead: 
          "The Primitives cannot be judged as a whole, for they are utterly unlike each 
          other. <br><br>
          
          This old madman confounds them all together. <br><br>
          
           Cimabue is a corrupt 
          Byzantine, Giotto gives hints of powerful genius, but his modelling is bad, 
          and, like children, he gives all his characters the same face. <br><br>
          
          The early 
          Italians have grace and joy, because they are Italians. <br><br>
          
          The Venetians have 
          an instinct for fine colour. <br><br>
          
          But when all is said and done these exquisite 
          craftsmen enamel and gild rather than paint. <br><br>
          
          There is far too much softness 
          about the heart and the colouring of your saintly Angelico for me. <br><br>
          
          As for the 
          Flemish school, that's quite another pair of shoes. <br><br>
          
          They can use their hands, 
          and in glory of workmanship they are on a level with the Chinese lacquer
          workers. <br><br>
          
          The technique of the brothers Van Eyck is a marvel, but I cannot 
          discover in their Adoration of the Lamb the charm and mystery that some 
          have vaunted. <br><br>
          
          Everything in it is treated with a pitiless perfection; it is 
          vulgar in feeling and cruelly ugly. <br><br>
          
          Memling may touch one perhaps; but he 
          creates nothing but sick wretches and cripples; under the heavy, rich, and 
          ungraceful robing of his virgins and saints one divines some very lamentable 
          anatomy. <br><br>
          
          I did not wait for Rogier van der Wyden to call himself Roger de la 
          Pasture and turn Frenchman in order to prefer him to Memling. <br><br>
          
          This Rogier 
          or Roger is less of a ninny; but then he is more lugubrious, and the rigidity 
          of his lines bears eloquent testimony to his poverty-stricken figures. <br><br>
          
          It is a 
          strange perversion to take pleasure in these carnivalesque figures when one 
          can have the paintings of Leonardo, Titian, Correggio, Velasquez, Rubens, 
          Rembrandt, Poussin, or Prud'hon. <br><br>
          
          Really it is a perverted instinct." 
          Meanwhile the Abbé Patouille and Maurice d'Esparvieu were strolling 
          leisurely along in the wake of the esthete and the librarian. <br><br>
          
          As a general rule 
          the Abbé Patouille was little inclined to talk theology with laymen, or, for 
          that matter, with clerics either. <br><br>
          
          Carried away, however, by the attractiveness 
          of the subject, he was telling the youthful Maurice all about the sacred 
          mission of those guardian angels which Monsieur Delacroix had so 
          inopportunely excluded from his picture. <br><br>
          
          And in order to give more adequate 
          expression to his thoughts on such lofty themes, the Abbé Patouille 
          borrowed whole phrases and sentences from Bossuet. <br><br>
          
          He had got them up 
          by heart to put in his sermons, for he adhered strongly to tradition. <br><br>
          
          
          "Yes, my son," he was saying, "God has appointed tutelary spirits to be near 
          us. <br><br>
          
          They come to us laden with His gifts. <br><br>
          
           They return laden with our 
          prayers. Such is their task. Not an hour, not a moment passes but they are 
          at our side, ready to help us, ever fervent and unwearying guardians, 
          watchmen that never slumber." <br><br>

          "Quite so, Abbé," murmured Maurice, who was wondering by what cunning 
          artifice he could get on the soft side of his mother and persuade her to give 
          him some money of which he was urgently in need. <br><br>
        </p>



        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN PÈRE SARIETTE DISCOVERS HIS MISSING TREASURES </p>

        <p>
          NEXT morning Monsieur Sariette entered Monsieur René d'Esparvieu's 
          study without knocking. <br><br>
          
          He raised his arms to the heavens, his few hairs 
          were standing straight up on his head. <br><br>
          
          His eyes were big with terror. <br><br>
          
           In 
          husky tones he stammered out the dreadful news. <br><br>
          
          A very old manuscript of 
          Flavius Josephus; sixty volumes of all sizes; a priceless jewel, namely, a 
          Lucretius adorned with the arms of Philippe de Vendôme, Grand Prior of 
          France, with notes in Voltaire's own hand; a manuscript of Richard Simon, 
          and a set of Gassendi's correspondence with Gabriel Naudé, comprising two 
          hundred and thirty-eight unpublished letters, had disappeared. <br><br>
          
          This time 
          the owner of the library was alarmed. <br><br>
          
          
          He mounted in haste to the abode of the philosophers and the globes, and 
          there with his own eyes confirmed the magnitude of the disaster. <br><br>
          
          
          There were yawning gaps on many a shelf. <br><br>
          
          He searched here and there, 
          opened cupboards, dragged out brooms, dusters, and fire-extinguishers, 
          rattled the shovel in the coke fire, shook out Monsieur Sariette's best frock
          coat that was hanging in the cloak-room, and then stood and gazed 
          disconsolately at the empty places left by the Gassendi portfolios. <br><br>
          
          
          For the past half-century the whole learned world had been loudly 
          clamouring for the publication of this correspondence. <br><br>
          
          Monsieur René 
          d'Esparvieu had not responded to the universal desire, unwilling either to 
          assume so heavy a task, or to resign it to others. <br><br>
          
          Having found much 
          boldness of thought in these letters, and many passages of more libertine 
          tendency than the piety of the twentieth century could endure, he preferred 
          that they should remain unpublished; but he felt himself responsible for 
          their safe-keeping, not only to his country but to the whole civilized world. <br><br>
          
          
          "How can you have allowed yourself to be robbed of such a treasure?" he 
          asked severely of Monsieur Sariette. <br><br>
          
          
          "How can I have allowed myself to be robbed of such a treasure?" repeated 
          the unhappy librarian. <br><br>
          
          "Monsieur, if you opened my breast, you would find 
          that question engraved upon my heart." <br><br>
          
           
          Unmoved by this powerful utterance, Monsieur d'Esparvieu continued with 
          pent-up fury: 
          "And you have discovered no single sign that would put you on the track of 
          the thief, Monsieur Sariette? You have no suspicion, not the faintest idea, of 
          the way these things have come to pass? You have seen nothing, heard 
          nothing, noticed nothing, learnt nothing? You must grant this is 
          unbelievable. <br><br>
          
          Think, Monsieur Sariette, think of the possible consequences 
          of this unheard-of theft, committed under your eyes. <br><br>
          
          A document of 
          inestimable value in the history of the human mind disappears. <br><br>
          
          Who has 
          stolen it? Why has it been stolen? Who will gain by it? Those who have got 
          possession of it doubtless know that they will be unable to dispose of it in 
          France. <br><br>
          
          They will go and sell it in America or Germany. <br><br>
          
           Germany is greedy 
          for such literary monuments. <br><br>
          
          Should the correspondence of Gassendi with 
          Gabriel Naudé go over to Berlin, if it is published there by German savants, 
          what a disaster, nay, what a scandal! Monsieur Sariette, have you not 
          thought of that?..." <br><br>
          
           
          Beneath the stroke of an accusation all the more cruel in that he brought it 
          against himself, Monsieur Sariette stood stupefied, and was silent. <br><br>
          
          And 
          Monsieur d'Esparvieu continued to overwhelm him with bitter reproaches. <br><br>
          
          
          "And you make no effort. <br><br>
          
          You devise nothing to find these inestimable 
          treasures. <br><br>
          
          Make enquiries, bestir yourself, Monsieur Sariette; use your wits. <br><br>
          
           
          It is well worth while." <br><br>
          
           
          And Monsieur d'Esparvieu went out, throwing an icy glance at his librarian. <br><br>
          
          
          Monsieur Sariette sought the lost books and manuscripts in every spot 
          where he had already sought them a hundred times, and where they could 
          not possibly be. <br><br>
          
          He even looked in the coke-box and under the leather seat 
          of his arm-chair. <br><br>
          
          When midday struck he mechanically went downstairs. <br><br>
          
           At 
          the foot of the stairs he met his old pupil Maurice, with whom he exchanged 
          a bow. <br><br>
          
          But he only saw men and things as through a mist. <br><br>
          
           
          The broken-hearted curator had already reached the hall when Maurice 
          called him back. <br><br>
          
          
          "Monsieur Sariette, while I think of it, do have the books removed that are 
          choking up my garden-house." <br><br>
          
           
          "What books, Maurice?" 
          "I could not tell you, Monsieur Sariette, but there are some in Hebrew, all 
          worm-eaten, with a whole heap of old papers. <br><br> They are in my way. You can't 
          turn round in the passage." 
          "Who took them there?" 
          "I'm bothered if I know." 
          And the young man rushed off to the dining-room, the luncheon gong 
          having sounded quite a minute ago. <br><br>
          
          
          Monsieur Sariette tore away to the summer-house. <br><br>
          
          Maurice had spoken the 
          truth. <br><br>
          
          About a hundred volumes were there, on tables, on chairs, even on 
          the floor. <br><br>
          
          When he saw them he was divided betwixt joy and fear, filled with 
          amazement and anxiety. <br><br>
          
          Happy in the finding of his lost treasure, dreading 
          to lose it again, and completely overwhelmed with astonishment, the man of 
          books alternately babbled like an infant and uttered the hoarse cries of a 
          maniac. <br><br>
          
          He recognised his Hebrew Bibles, his ancient Talmuds, his very old 
          manuscript of Flavius Josephus, his portfolios of Gassendi's letters to 
          Gabriel Naudé, and his richest jewel of all, to wit, Lucretius adorned with 
          the arms of the Grand Prior of France, and with notes in Voltaire's own 
          hand. <br><br>
          
          He laughed, he cried, he kissed the morocco, the calf, the parchment, 
          and vellum, even the wooden boards studded with nails. <br><br>
          
          
          As fast as Hippolyte, the manservant, returned with an armful to the library, 
          Monsieur Sariette, with a trembling hand, restored them piously to their 
          places. <br><br>


        </p>


        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">OF A SOMEWHAT LIVELY INTEREST, WHEREOF THE MORAL WILL, I 
          HOPE, APPEAL GREATLY TO MY READERS, SINCE IT CAN BE 
          EXPRESSED BY THIS SORROWFUL QUERY: "THOUGHT, WHITHER 
          DOST THOU LEAD ME?" FOR IT IS A UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED TRUTH 
          THAT IT IS UNHEALTHY TO THINK AND THAT TRUE WISDOM LIES IN 
          NOT THINKING AT ALL</p>


          <p>
            ALL the books were now once more assembled in the pious keeping of 
            Monsieur Sariette. <br><br>
            
            But this happy reunion was not destined to last. <br><br>
            
             The 
            following night twenty volumes left their places, among them the Lucretius 
            of Prior de Vendôme. <br><br>
            
            Within a week the old Hebrew and Greek texts had all 
            returned to the summer-house, and every night during the ensuing month 
            they left their shelves and secretly went on the same path. <br><br>
            
            Others betook 
            themselves no one knew whither. <br><br>
            
            
            On hearing of these mysterious occurrences, Monsieur René d'Esparvieu 
            merely remarked with frigidity to his librarian: 
            "My poor Sariette, all this is very queer, very queer indeed." <br><br>

            And when Monsieur Sariette tentatively advised him to lodge a formal 
            complaint or to inform the Commissaire de Police, Monsieur d'Esparvieu 
            cried out upon him: 
            "What are you suggesting, Monsieur Sariette? Divulge domestic secrets, 
            make a scandal! You cannot mean it. <br><br>
            
            I have enemies, and I am proud of it. <br><br>
            
             I 
            think I have deserved them. <br><br>
            
            What I might complain about is that I am 
            wounded in the house of my friend, attacked with unheard-of violence, by 
            fervent loyalists, who, I grant you, are good Catholics, but exceedingly bad 
            Christians.... <br><br>
            
             In a word, I am watched, spied upon, shadowed, and you 
            suggest, Monsieur Sariette, that I should make a present of this comic-opera 
            mystery, this burlesque adventure, this story in which we both cut 
            somewhat pitiable figures, to a set of spiteful journalists? Do you wish to 
            cover me with ridicule?" <br><br>


            The result of the colloquy was that the two gentlemen agreed to change all 
            the locks in the library. <br><br>
            
            Estimates were asked for and workmen called in. <br><br>
            
             
            For six weeks the d'Esparvieu household rang from morning till night with 
            the sound of hammers, the hum of centre-bits, and the grating of files. <br><br>
            
            Fires 
            were always going in the abode of the philosophers and globes, and the 
            people of the house were simply sickened by the smell of heated oil. <br><br>
            
            The old, 
            smooth, easy-running locks were replaced, on the cupboards and doors of 
            the rooms, by stubborn and tricky fastenings. <br><br>
            
            There was nothing but 
            combinations of locks, letter-padlocks, safety-bolts, bars, chains, and 
            electric alarm-bells. <br><br>
            
            
            All this display of ironmongery inspired fear. <br><br>
            
            The lock-cases glistened, and 
            there was much grinding of bolts. <br><br>
            
            To gain access to a room, a cupboard, or a 
            drawer, it was necessary to know a certain number, of which Monsieur 
            Sariette alone was cognisant. <br><br>
            
            His head was filled with bizarre words and 
            tremendous numbers, and he got entangled among all these cryptic signs, 
            these square, cubic, and triangular figures. <br><br>
            
            He himself couldn't get the 
            doors and the cupboards undone, yet every morning he found them wide 
            open, and the books thrown about, ransacked, and hidden away. <br><br>
            
            In the 
            gutter of the Rue Servandoni a policeman picked up a volume of Salomon 
            Reinach on the identity of Barabbas and Jesus Christ. <br><br>
            
            As it bore the book
            plate of the d'Esparvieu library he returned it to the owner. <br><br>
            
            
            Monsieur René d'Esparvieu, not even deigning to inform Monsieur Sariette 
            of the fact, made up his mind to consult a magistrate, a friend in whom he 
            had complete confidence, to wit, a certain Monsieur des Aubels, Counsel at 
            the Law Courts, who had put through many an important affair. <br><br>
            
            He wasa 
            little plump man, very red, very bald, with a cranium that shone like a 
            billiard ball. <br><br>
            
            He entered the library one morning feigning to come as a book
            lover, but he soon showed that he knew nothing about books. <br><br>
            
            While all the 
            busts of the ancient philosophers were reflected in his shining pate, he put 
            divers insidious questions to Monsieur Sariette, who grew uncomfortable 
            and turned red, for innocence is easily flustered. <br><br>
            
            From that moment 
            Monsieur des Aubels had a mighty suspicion that Monsieur Sariette was the 
            perpetrator of the very thefts he denounced with horror; and it immediately 
            occurred to him to seek out the accomplices of the crime. <br><br>
            
            As regards 
            motives, he did not trouble about them; motives are always to be found. <br><br>
            
            
            Monsieur des Aubels told Monsieur René d'Esparvieu that, if he liked, he 
            would have the house secretly watched by a detective from the Prefecture. <br><br>
            
            
            "I will see that you get Mignon," he said. <br><br>
            
            "He is an excellent servant, 
            assiduous and prudent." 
            By six o'clock next morning Mignon was already walking up and down 
            outside the d'Esparvieus' house, his head sunk between his shoulders, 
            wearing love-locks which showed from under the narrow brim of his bowler 
            hat, his eye cocked over his shoulder. <br><br>
            
            He wore an enormous dull-black 
            moustache, his hands and feet were huge; in fact, his whole appearance was 
            distinctly memorable. <br><br>
            
            He paced regularly up and down from the nearest of 
            the big rams' head pillars which adorn the Hôtel de la Sordière to the end of 
            the Rue Garancière, towards the apse of St. <br><br>
            
            Sulpice Church and the dome of 
            the Chapel of the Virgin. <br><br>
            
            
            Henceforth it became impossible to enter or leave the d'Esparvieus' house 
            without feeling that one's every action, that one's very thoughts, were being 
            spied upon. <br><br>
            
            Mignon was a prodigious person endowed with powers that 
            Nature denies to other mortals. <br><br>
            
            He neither ate nor slept. <br><br>
            
             At all hours of the 
            day and night, in wind and rain, he was to be found outside the house, and 
            no one escaped the X-rays of his eye. <br><br>
            
            One felt pierced through and through, 
            penetrated to the very marrow, worse than naked, bare as a skeleton. <br><br>
            
            It was 
            the affair of a moment; the detective did not even stop, but continued his 
            everlasting walk. <br><br>
            
            It became intolerable. <br><br>
            
             Young Maurice threatened to leave 
            the paternal roof if he was to be so radiographed. <br><br>
            
            His mother and his sister 
            Berthe complained of his piercing look; it offended the chaste modesty of 
            their souls. <br><br>
            
            Mademoiselle Caporal, young Léon d'Esparvieu's governess, felt 
            an indescribable embarrassment. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur René d'Esparvieu was sick of 
            the whole business. <br><br>
            
            He never crossed his own threshold without crushing 
            his hat over his eyes to avoid the investigating ray and without wishing old 
            Sariette, the fons et origo of all the evil, at the devil. <br><br>
            
            The intimates of the 
            household, such as Abbé Patouille and Uncle Gaétan, made themselves 
            scarce; visitors gave up calling, tradespeople hesitated about leaving their 
            goods, the carts belonging to the big shops scarcely dared stop. <br><br>
            
            But it was 
            among the domestics that the spying roused the most disorder. <br><br>
            
            
            The footman, afraid, under the eye of the police, to go and join the cobbler's 
            wife over her solitary labours in the afternoon, found the house unbearable 
            and gave notice. <br><br>
            
            Odile, Madame d'Esparvieu's lady's-maid, not daring, as 
            was her custom after her mistress had retired, to introduce Octave, the 
            handsomest of the neighbouring bookseller's clerks, to her little room 
            upstairs, grew melancholy, irritable and nervous, pulled her mistress's hair 
            while dressing it, spoke insolently, and made advances to Monsieur 
            Maurice. <br><br>
            
            The cook, Madame Malgoire, a serious matron of some fifty years, 
            having no more visits from Auguste, the wine-merchant's man in the Rue 
            Servandoni, and being incapable of suffering a privation so contrary to her 
            temperament, went mad, sent up a raw rabbit to table, and announced that 
            the Pope had asked her hand in marriage. <br><br>
            
            At last, after a fortnight of 
            superhuman assiduity, contrary to all known laws of organic life, and to the 
            essential conditions of animal economy, Mignon, the detective, having 
            observed nothing abnormal, ceased his surveillance and withdrew without a 
            word, refusing to accept a gratuity. <br><br>
            
            In the library the dance of the books 
            became livelier than ever. <br><br>
            
            
            "That is all right," said Monsieur des Aubels. <br><br>
            
            "Since nothing comes in nor 
            goes out, the evil-doer must be in the house." <br><br>
            
             
            The magistrate thought it possible to discover the criminal without police
            warrant or enquiry. <br><br>
            
            On a date agreed upon at midnight, he had the floor of 
            the library, the treads of the stairs, the vestibule, the garden path leading to 
            Monsieur Maurice's summer-house, and the entrance hall of the latter, all 
            covered with a coating of talc. <br><br>
            
            
            The following morning Monsieur des Aubels, assisted by a photographer 
            from the Prefecture, and accompanied by Monsieur René d'Esparvieu and 
            Monsieur Sariette, came to take the imprints. <br><br>
            
            They found nothing in the 
            garden, the wind had blown away the coating of talc; nothing in the 
            summer-house either. <br><br>
            
            Young Maurice told them he thought it was some 
            practical joke and that he had brushed away the white dust with the hearth
            brush. <br><br>
            
            The real truth was, he had effaced the traces left by the boots of 
            Odile, the lady's-maid. <br><br>
            
            On the stairs and in the library the very light print of 
            a bare foot could be discerned, it seemed to have sprung into the air and to 
            have touched the ground at rare intervals and without any pressure. <br><br>
            
            They 
            discovered five of these traces. <br><br>
            
            The clearest was to be found in the abode of 
            the busts and spheres, on the edge of the table where the books were piled. <br><br>
            
            
            The photographer took several negatives of this imprint. <br><br>
            
            
            "This is more terrifying than anything else," murmured Monsieur Sariette. <br><br>
            
            
            Monsieur des Aubels did not hide his surprise. <br><br>
            
            
            Three days later the anthropometrical department of the Prefecture returned 
            the proofs exhibited to them, saying that they were not in the records. <br><br>
            
            
            After dinner Monsieur René showed the photographs to his brother Gaétan, 
            who examined them with profound attention, and after a long silence 
            exclaimed: 
            "No wonder they have not got this at the Prefecture; it is the foot of a god or 
            of an athlete of antiquity. <br><br>
            
            The sole that made this impression is of a 
            perfection unknown to our races and our climates. <br><br>
            
            It exhibits toes of 
            exquisite grace, and a divine heel." <br><br>
            
             
            René d'Esparvieu cried out upon his brother for a madman. 
            "He is a poet," sighed Madame d'Esparvieu. <br><br> 
            "Uncle," said Maurice, "you'll fall in love with this foot if you ever come 
            across it." <br><br>
            "Such was the fate of Vivant Denon, who accompanied Bonaparte to Egypt," 
            replied Gaétan. <br><br>
            
            "At Thebes, in a tomb violated by the Arabs, Denon found 
            the little foot of a mummy of marvellous beauty. <br><br>
            
            He contemplated it with 
            extraordinary fervour, 'It is the foot of a young woman,' he pondered, 'of a 
            princess—of a charming creature. <br><br>
            
            No covering has ever marred its perfect 
            shape.' <br><br>
            
             Denon admired, adored, and loved it. <br><br>
            
            You may see a drawing of this 
            little foot in Denon's atlas of his journey to Egypt, whose leaves one could 
            turn over upstairs, without going further afield, if only Monsieur Sariette 
            would ever let us see a single volume of his library." <br><br>
            Sometimes, in bed, Maurice, waking in the middle of the night, thought he 
            heard the sound of pages being turned over in the next room, and the thud 
            of bound volumes falling on the floor. <br><br> 
            One morning at five o'clock he was coming home from the club, after a night 
            of bad luck, and while he stood outside the door of the summer-house, 
            hunting in his pocket for his keys, his ears distinctly heard a voice sighing: 
            "Knowledge, whither dost thou lead me? Thought, whither dost thou lure 
            me?" 
            But entering the two rooms he saw nothing, and told himself that his ears 
            must have deceived him. <br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHICH SPEAKS OF LOVE, A SUBJECT WHICH ALWAYS GIVES 
          PLEASURE, FOR A TALE WITHOUT LOVE IS LIKE BEEF WITHOUT 
          MUSTARD: AN INSIPID DISH</p>

          <p>
            OTHING ever astonished Maurice. He never sought to know the causes of 
            things and dwelt tranquilly in the world of appearances. <br><br>
            
            Not denying the 
            eternal truth, he nevertheless followed vain things as his fancy led him. <br><br>
            
            
            Less addicted to sport and violent exercise than most young people of his 
            generation, he followed unconsciously the old erotic traditions of his race. <br><br>
            
            
            The French were ever the most gallant of men, and it were a pity they should 
            lose this advantage. <br><br>
            
            Maurice preserved it. <br><br>
            
             He was in love with no woman, 
            but, as St. Augustine said, he loved to love. <br><br>
            
            After paying the tribute that was 
            rightly due to the imperishable beauty and secret arts of Madame de la 
            Berthelière, he had enjoyed the impetuous caresses of a young singer called 
            Luciole. <br><br>
            
            At present he was joylessly experiencing the primitive perversity of 
            Odile, his mother's lady's-maid, and the tearful adoration of the beautiful 
            Madame Boittier. <br><br>
            
            And he felt a great void in his heart. <br><br>
            
             
            It chanced that one Wednesday, on entering the drawing-room where his 
            mother entertained her friends—who were, generally speaking, unattractive 
            and austere ladies, with a sprinkling of old men and very young people—he 
            noticed, in this intimate circle, Madame des Aubels, the wife of the 
            magistrate at the Law Courts, whom Monsieur d'Esparvieu had vainly 
            consulted on the mysterious ransacking of his library. <br><br>
            
            She was young, he 
            found her pretty, and not without cause. <br><br>
            
            Gilberte had been modelled by the 
            Genius of the Race, and no other genius had had a part in the work. <br><br>
            
            
            Thus all her attributes inspired desire, and nothing in her shape or her 
            being aroused any other sentiment. <br><br>
            
            
            The law of attraction which draws world to world moved young Maurice to 
            approach this delicious creature, and under its influence he offered to escort 
            her to the tea-table. <br><br>
            
            And when Gilberte was served with tea, he said: 
            "We should hit it off quite well together, you and I, don't you think?" 
            He spoke in this way, according to modern usage, so as to avoid inane 
            compliments and to spare a woman the boredom of listening to one of those 
            old declarations of love which, containing nothing but what is vague and 
            undefined, require neither a truthful nor an exact reply. <br><br>
            
            
            And profiting by the fact that he had an opportunity of conversing secretly 
            with Madame des Aubels for a few minutes, he spoke urgently and to the 
            point. <br><br>
            
            Gilberte, so far as one could judge, was made rather to awaken desire 
            than to feel it. <br><br>
            
            Nevertheless, she well knew that her fate was to love, and she 
            followed it willingly and with pleasure. <br><br>
            
            Maurice did not particularly 
            displease her. <br><br>
            
            She would have preferred him to be an orphan, for experience 
            had taught her how disappointing it sometimes is to love the son of the 
            house. <br><br>
            
            
            "Will you?" he said by way of conclusion. <br><br>
            
            
            She pretended not to understand, and with her little foie-gras sandwich 
            raised half-way to her mouth she looked at Maurice with wondering eyes. <br><br>
            
            
            "Will I what?" she asked. <br><br>
            
            
            "You know quite well." <br><br>
            Madame des Aubels lowered her eyes, and sipped her tea, for her 
            prudishness was not quite vanquished. Meanwhile Maurice, taking her 
            empty cup from her hand, murmured: 
            "Saturday, five o'clock, 126 Rue de Rome, on the ground-floor, the door on 
            the right, under the arch. Knock three times." <br><br>
            Madame des Aubels glanced severely and imperturbably at the son of the 
            house, and with a self-possessed air rejoined the circle of highly 
            respectablewomen to whom the Senator Monsieur Le Fol was explaining how 
            artificial incubators were employed at the agricultural colony at St. 
            Julienne. <br><br>
            The following Saturday, Maurice, in his ground-floor flat, awaited Madame 
            des Aubels. <br><br>
            
            He waited her in vain. <br><br>
            
             No light hand came to knock three times 
            on the door under the arch. <br><br>
            
            And Maurice gave way to imprecation, inwardly 
            calling the absent one a jade and a hussy. <br><br>
            
            His fruitless wait, his frustrated 
            desires, rendered him unjust. <br><br>
            
            For Madame des Aubels in not coming where 
            she had never promised to go hardly deserved these names; but we judge 
            human actions by the pleasure or pain they cause us. <br><br>
            
            
            Maurice did not put in an appearance in his mother's drawing-room until a 
            fortnight after the conversation at the tea-table. <br><br>
            
            He came late. <br><br>
            
             Madame des 
            Aubels had been there for half an hour. <br><br>
            
            He bowed coldly to her, took a seat 
            some way off, and affected to be listening to the talk. <br><br>
            
            
            "Worthily matched," a rich male voice was saying; "the two antagonists were 
            well calculated to render the struggle a terrible and uncertain one.<br><br>
            
            General 
            Bol, with unprecedented tenacity, maintained his position as though he 
            were rooted in the very soil.<br><br>
            
            General Milpertuis, with an agility truly 
            superhuman, kept carrying out movements of the most dazzling rapidity 
            around his immovable adversary.<br><br>
            
            The battle continued to be waged 
            withterrible stubbornness. We were all in an agony of suspense...." <br><br>
            It was General d'Esparvieu describing the autumn manœuvres to a company 
            of breathlessly interested ladies. <br><br>
            
            He was talking well and his audience were 
            delighted. <br><br>
            
            Proceeding to draw a comparison between the French and 
            German methods, he defined their distinguishing characteristics and 
            brought out the conspicuous merits of both with a lofty impartiality. <br><br>
            
            He did 
            not hesitate to affirm that each system had its advantages, and at first made 
            it appear to his circle of wondering, disappointed, and anxious dames, 
            whose countenances were growing increasingly gloomy, that France and 
            Germany were practically in a position of equality. <br><br>
            
            But little by little, as the 
            strategist went on to give a clearer definition of the two methods, that of the 
            French began to appear flexible, elegant, vigorous, full of grace, cleverness, 
            and verve; that of the Germans heavy, clumsy, and undecided. <br><br>
            
            And slowly 
            and surely the faces of the ladies began to clear and to light up with joyous 
            smiles. <br><br>
            
            In order to dissipate any lingering shadows of misgiving from the 
            minds of these wives, sisters, and sweethearts, the General gave them to 
            understand that we were in a position to make use of the German method 
            when it suited us, but that the Germans could not avail themselves of the 
            French method. <br><br>
            
            No sooner had he delivered himself of these sentiments 
            than he was button-holed by Monsieur le Truc de Ruffec, who was engaged 
            in founding a patriotic society known as "Swordsmen All," of which the 
            object was to regenerate France and ensure her superiority over all her 
            adversaries. <br><br>
            
            Even children in the cradle were to be enrolled, and Monsieur le 
            Truc de Ruffec offered the honorary presidency to General d'Esparvieu. <br><br>
            
            
            Meanwhile Maurice was appearing to be interested in a conversation that 
            was taking place between a very gentle old lady and the Abbé Lapetite, 
            Chaplain to the Dames du Saint Sang. <br><br>
            
            The old lady, severely tried of late by 
            illness and the loss of friends, wanted to know how it was that people were 
            unhappy in this world. <br><br>
            
            
            "How," she asked Abbé Lapetite, "do you explain the scourges that afflict 
            mankind? Why are there plagues, famines, floods, and earthquakes?" 
            "It is surely necessary that God should sometimes remind us of his 
            existence," replied Abbé Lapetite, with a heavenly smile. <br><br>
            
            
            Maurice appeared keenly interested in this conversation. <br><br>
            
            Then he seemed 
            fascinated by Madame Fillot-Grandin, quite a personable young woman, 
            whose simple innocence, however, detracted all piquancy from her beauty, 
            all savour from her bodily charms. <br><br>
            
            A very sour, shrill-voiced old lady, who, 
            affecting the dowdy, woollen weeds of poverty, displayed the pride of a great 
            lady in the world of Christian finance, exclaimed in a squeaky voice: 
            "Well, my dear Madame d'Esparvieu, so you have had trouble here. <br><br>
            
            The 
            papers speak darkly of robbery, of thefts committed in Monsieur 
            d'Esparvieu's valuable library, of stolen letters...." <br><br>
            "Oh," said Madame d'Esparvieu, "if we are to believe all the newspapers 
            say...." <br><br>
            "Oh, so, dear Madame, you have got your treasures back. All's well that 
            ends well." 
            "The library is in perfect order," asserted Madame d'Esparvieu. "There is 
            nothing missing." <br><br>
            "The library is on the floor above this, is it not?" asked young Madame des 
            Aubels, showing an unexpected interest in the books. <br><br>
            
            
            Madame d'Esparvieu replied that the library occupied the whole of the 
            second floor, and that they had put the least valuable books in the attics. <br><br>
            
            
            "Could I not go and look at it?" 
            The mistress of the house declared that nothing could be easier. <br><br>
            
            She called 
            to her son: 
            "Maurice, go and do the honours of the library to Madame des Aubels." 
            Maurice rose, and without uttering a word, mounted to the second floor in 
            the wake of Madame des Aubels.<br><br>
            
            
            He appeared indifferent, but inwardly he rejoiced, for he had no doubt that 
            Gilberte had feigned her ardent desire to inspect the library simply to see 
            him in secret.<br><br>
            
            And, while affecting indifference, he promised himself to 
            renew those offers which, this time, would not be refused.<br><br>
            
            
            Under the romantic bust of Alexandre d'Esparvieu, they were met by the 
            silent shadow of a little wan, hollow-eyed old man, who wore a settled 
            expression of mute terror.<br><br>
            
            
            "Do not let us disturb you, Monsieur Sariette," said Maurice.<br><br>
            
            "I am showing 
            Madame des Aubels round the library." <br><br>

            Maurice and Madame des Aubels passed on into the great room where 
            against the four walls rose presses filled with books and surmounted by 
            bronze busts of poets, philosophers, and orators of antiquity.<br><br>
            
            All was in 
            perfect order, an order which seemed never to have been disturbed from the 
            beginning of things.<br><br>
            
            
            Only, a black void was to be seen in the place which, only the evening 
            before, had been filled by an unpublished manuscript of Richard Simon.<br><br>
            
            
            Meanwhile, by the side of the young couple walked Monsieur Sariette, pale, 
            faded, and silent.<br><br>
            
            
            "Really and truly, you have not been nice," said Maurice, with a look of 
            reproach at Madame des Aubels.<br><br>
            
            
            She signed to him that the librarian might over-hear.<br><br>
            
            But he reassured her.<br><br>
            
             
            "Take no notice. It is old Sariette. He has become a complete idiot."<br><br> And he 
            repeated: "No, you have not been at all nice. I awaited you. You did not 
            come.<br><br> You have made me unhappy." 
            After a moment's silence, while one heard the low melancholy whistling of 
            asthma in poor Sariette's bronchial tubes, young Maurice continued 
            insistently: 
            "You are wrong." <br><br>
            "Why wrong?" 
            "Wrong not to do as I ask you." 
            "Do you still think so?" 
            "Certainly." <br><br>
            "You meant it seriously?" 
            "As seriously as can be." 
            Touched by his assurance of sincere and constant feeling, and thinking she 
            had resisted sufficiently, Gilberte granted to Maurice what she had refused 
            him a fortnight ago.<br><br>
            
            
            They slipped into an embrasure of the window, behind an enormous 
            celestial globe whereon were graven the Signs of the Zodiac and the figures 
            of the stars, and there, their gaze fixed on the Lion, the Virgin, and the 
            Scales, in the presence of a multitude of Bibles, before the works of the 
            Fathers, both Greek and Latin, beneath the casts of Homer, Æschylus, 
            Sophocles, Euripides, Herodotus, Thucydides, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, 
            Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Seneca, and Epictetus, they exchanged 
            vows of love and a long kiss on the mouth.<br><br>
            
            
            Almost immediately Madame des Aubels bethought herself that she still had 
            some calls to pay, and that she must make her escape quickly, for love had 
            not made her lose all sense of her own importance.<br><br>
            
            But she had barely 
            crossed the landing with Maurice when they heard a hoarse cry and saw 
            Monsieur Sariette plunge madly downstairs, exclaiming as he went: 
            "Stop it, stop it; I saw it fly away! It escaped from the shelf by itself.<br><br>
            
            It 
            crossed the room ... there it is—there! It's going downstairs. <br><br> Stop it! It has 
            gone out of the door on the ground floor!" 
            "What?" asked Maurice. <br><br> 
            Monsieur Sariette looked out of the landing window, murmuring horror
            struck: 
            "It's crossing the garden! It's going into the summer-house. <br><br> Stop it, stop it!" 
            "But what is it?" repeated Maurice—"in God's name, what is it?" 
            "My Flavius Josephus," exclaimed Monsieur Sariette. <br><br> "Stop it!" 
            And he fell down unconscious. <br><br> 
            "You see he is quite mad," said Maurice to Madame des Aubels, as he lifted 
            up the unfortunate librarian. <br><br> 
            Gilberte, a little pale, said she also thought she had seen something in the 
            direction indicated by the unhappy man, something flying. <br><br> 
            Maurice had seen nothing, but he had felt what seemed like a gust of wind. <br><br> 
            He left Monsieur Sariette in the arms of Hippolyte and the housekeeper, who 
            had both hastened to the spot on hearing the noise. <br><br> 
            The old gentleman had a wound in his head. <br><br> 
            "All the better," said the housekeeper; "this wound may save him from 
            having a fit." <br><br> 
            Madame des Aubels gave her handkerchief to stop the blood, and 
            recommended an arnica compress. <br><br>
          </p>


        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN IT IS SHOWN THAT, AS AN ANCIENT GREEK POET SAID, 
          "NOTHING IS SWEETER THAN APHRODITE THE GOLDEN" </p>

          <p>
            LTHOUGH he had enjoyed Madame des Aubels' favours for six whole 
            months, Maurice still loved her. True they had had to separate during the 
            summer. <br><br>
            
            For lack of funds of his own he had had to go to Switzerland with 
            his mother, and then to stop with the whole family at the Château 
            d'Esparvieu. <br><br>
            
            She had spent the summer with her mother at Niort, and the 
            autumn with her husband at a little Normandy seaside place, so that they 
            had hardly seen each other four or five times. <br><br>
            
            But since the winter, kindly to 
            lovers, had brought them back to town again, Maurice had been receiving 
            her twice a week in his little flat in the Rue de Rome, and received no one 
            else. <br><br>
            
            No other woman had inspired him with feelings of such constancy and 
            fidelity. <br><br>
            
            What augmented his pleasure was that he believed himself loved, 
            and indeed he was not unpleasing. <br><br>
            
            
            He thought that she did not deceive him, not that he had any reason to 
            think so, but it appeared right and fitting that she should be content with 
            him alone. <br><br>
            
            What annoyed him was that she always kept him waiting, and 
            was unpunctual in coming to their meeting-place; she was invariably late,—
            at times very late. <br><br>
            
            
            Now on Saturday, January 30th, since four o'clock in the afternoon, Maurice 
            had been awaiting Madame des Aubels in the little pink room, where a 
            bright fire was burning. <br><br>
            
            He was gaily clad in a suit of flowered pyjamas, 
            smoking Turkish cigarettes. <br><br>
            
            At first he dreamt of receiving her with long 
            kisses, with hitherto unknown caresses. <br><br>
            
            A quarter of an hour having 
            passed, he meditated serious and affectionate reproaches, then after an 
            hour of disappointed waiting he vowed he would meet her with cold disdain. <br><br>
            
            
            At length she appeared, fresh and fragrant. <br><br>
            
            
            "It was scarcely worth while coming," he said bitterly, as she laid her muff 
            and her little bag on the table and untied her veil before the wardrobe 
            mirror. <br><br>
            
            
            Never, she told her beloved, had she had such trouble to get away. <br><br>
            
            She was 
            full of excuses, which he obstinately rejected. <br><br>
            
            But no sooner had she the 
            good sense to hold her tongue than he ceased his reproaches, and then 
            nothing detracted from the longing with which she inspired him. <br><br>
            
            
            The curtains were drawn, the room was bathed in warm shadows lit by the 
            dancing gleams of the fire. <br><br>
            
            The mirrors in the wardrobe and on the chimney
            piece shone with mysterious lights. <br><br>
            
            Gilberte, leaning on her elbow, head on 
            hand, was lost in thought. <br><br>
            
            A little jeweller, a trustworthy and intelligent 
            man, had shown her a wonderfully pretty pearl and sapphire bracelet; it was 
            worth a great deal, and was to be had for a mere nothing. <br><br>
            
            He had got it from 
            a cocotte down on her luck, who was in a hurry to dispose of it. <br><br>
            
            It was a rare 
            chance; it would be a huge pity to let it slip. <br><br>
            
            
            "Would you like to see it, darling? I will ask the little man to let me have it to 
            show you." <br><br>
            
             
            Maurice did not actually decline the proposal. But it was clear that he took 
            no interest in the wonderful bracelet. <br><br>
            
            "When small jewellers come across a 
            great bargain, they keep it to themselves, and do not allow their customers 
            to profit by it. <br><br>
            
            Moreover, jewellery means nothing just now. <br><br>
            
             Well-bred women 
            have given up wearing it. <br><br>
            
            Everyone goes in for sport, and jewellery does not 
            go with sport." <br><br>
            
             
            Maurice spoke thus, contrary to truth, because having given his mistress a 
            fur coat, he was in no hurry to give her anything more. <br><br>
            
            He was not stingy, 
            but he was careful with his money. <br><br>
            
            His people did not give him a very large 
            allowance, and his debts grew bigger every day. <br><br>
            
            By satisfying the wishes of 
            his inamorata too promptly he feared to arouse others still more pressing. <br><br>
            
            
            The bargain seemed less wonderful to him than to Gilberte; besides, he liked 
            to take the initiative in choosing his gifts. <br><br>
            
            Above all, he thought that if he 
            gave her too many presents he would be no longer sure of being loved for 
            himself. <br><br>
            
            
            Madame des Aubels felt neither contempt nor surprise at this attitude; she 
            was gentle and temperate, she knew men, and judged that one must take 
            them as one found them, that for the most part they do not give very 
            willingly, and that a woman should know how to make them give. <br><br>
            
            
            Suddenly a gas lamp was lighted in the street, and shone through the gaps 
            in the curtains. <br><br>
            
            
            "Half-past six," she said. <br><br>
            
            "We must be on the move." <br><br>
            
              
            Pricked by the touch of Time's fleeting wing, Maurice was conscious of 
            reawakened desires and reanimated powers. <br><br>
            
            A white and radiant offering, 
            Gilberte, with her head thrown back, her eyes half closed, her lips apart, 
            sunk in dreamy languor, was breathing slowly and placidly, when suddenly 
            she started up with a cry of terror. <br><br>

            "Whatever is that?" 
            "Stay still," said Maurice, holding her back in his arms. <br><br>

            In his present mood, had the sky fallen it would not have troubled him. <br><br>
             But 
            in one bound she escaped from him. <br><br>
             Crouching down, her eyes filled with 
            terror, she was pointing with her finger at a figure which appeared in a 
            corner of the room, between the fire-place and the wardrobe with the mirror. <br><br>

            Then, unable to bear the sight, and nearly fainting, she hid her face in her 
            hands. <br><br>

          </p>


        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHICH FAR SURPASSES IN AUDACITY THE IMAGINATIVE FLIGHTS OF 
          DANTE AND MILTON</p>

        <p>
          AURICE at length turned his head, saw the figure, and perceiving that it 
          moved, was also frightened. Meanwhile, Gilberte was regaining her senses. <br><br>
          
          
          She imagined that what she had seen was some mistress whom her lover 
          had hidden in the room. <br><br>
          
          Inflamed with anger and disgust at the idea of such 
          treachery, boiling with indignation, and glaring at her supposed rival, she 
          exclaimed: 
          "A woman ... a naked woman too! You bring me into a room where you allow 
          your women to come, and when I arrive they have not had time to dress.<br><br>
          
          
          And you reproach me with arriving late! Your impudence is beyond belief! 
          Come, send the creature packing.<br><br>
          
          If you wanted us both here together, you 
          might at least have asked me whether it suited me...." <br><br>
          Maurice, wide-eyed and groping for a revolver that had never been there, 
          whispered in her ear: 
          "Be quiet ... it is no woman. One can scarcely see, but it is more like a man." <br><br>

          She put her hands over her eyes again and screamed harder than ever.<br><br>
          
          
          "A man! Where does he come from? A thief.<br><br>
          
          An assassin! Help! Help! Kill 
          him.... Maurice, kill him! Turn on the light. <br><br>
          
          No, don't turn on the light...." 
          She made a mental vow that should she escape from this danger she would 
          burn a candle to the Blessed Virgin. <br><br>
          
          Her teeth chattered. <br><br>
          
           
          The figure made a movement. <br><br>
          
          
          "Keep away!" cried Gilberte. "Keep away!" <br><br>
          She offered the burglar all the money and jewels she had on the table if he 
          would consent not to stir. <br><br>
          
          Amid her surprise and terror the idea assailed her 
          that her husband, dissembling his suspicions, had caused her to be 
          followed, had posted witnesses, and had had recourse to the Commissaire 
          de Police. <br><br>
          
          In a flash she distinctly saw before her the long painful future, the 
          glaring scandal, the pretended disdain, the cowardly desertion of her 
          friends, the just mockery of society, for it is indeed ridiculous to be found 
          out. <br><br>
          
          She saw the divorce, the loss of her position and of her rank. <br><br>
          
           She saw 
          the dreary and narrow existence with her mother, when no one would make 
          love to her, for men avoid women who fail to give them the security of the 
          married state. <br><br>
          
          And all this, why? Why this ruin, this disaster? For a piece of 
          folly, for a mere nothing. Thus in a lightning flash spoke the conscience of 
          Gilberte des Aubels. <br><br>

          "Have no fear, Madame," said a very sweet voice. <br><br>

          Slightly reassured, she found strength to ask: 
          "Who are you?" 
          "I am an angel," replied the voice.<br><br>

          "What did you say?" 
          "I am an angel. I am Maurice's guardian angel." 
          "Say it again. I am going mad. I do not understand...." <br><br>

          Maurice, without understanding either, was indignant.<br><br>
          
          He sprang forward 
          and showed himself; with his right hand armed with a slipper he made a 
          threatening gesture, and said in a rough voice: 
          "You are a low ruffian; oblige me by going the way you came."<br><br>

          "Maurice d'Esparvieu," continued the sweet voice, "He whom you adore as 
          your Creator has stationed by the side of each of the faithful a good angel, 
          whose mission it is to counsel and protect him; it is the invariable opinion of 
          the Fathers, it is founded on many passages in the Bible, the Church admits 
          it unanimously, without, however, pronouncing anathema upon those who 
          hold a contrary opinion.<br><br>
          
          You see before you one of these angels, yours, 
          Maurice. I was commanded to watch over your innocence and to guard your 
          chastity." <br><br>

          "That may be," said Maurice; "but you are certainly no gentleman. A 
          gentleman would not permit himself to enter a room at such a moment. <br><br>
          
          To 
          be plain, what the deuce are you doing here?" 
          "I have assumed this appearance, Maurice, because, having henceforth to 
          move among mankind, I have to make myself like them. <br><br>
          
          The celestial spirits 
          possess the power of assuming a form which renders them apparent to the 
          eye and to the touch. <br><br>
          
          This shape is real, because it is apparent, and all the 
          realities in the world are but appearances." 
          Gilberte, pacified at length, was arranging her hair on her forehead. <br><br>

          The Angel pursued: 
          "The celestial spirits adopt, according to their fancy, one sex or the other, or 
          both at once. But they cannot disguise themselves at any moment, 
          according to their caprice or fantasy.<br><br>
          
          Their metamorphoses are subject to 
          constant laws, which you would not understand.<br><br>
          
          Thus I have neither desire 
          nor power to transform myself under your eyes, for your amusement or my 
          own, into a lion, a tiger, a fly, or into a sycamore-shaving like the young 
          Egyptian whose story was found in a tomb.<br><br>
          
          I cannot change myself into an 
          ass as did Lucius with the pomade of the youthful Photis.<br><br>
          
          For in my wisdom 
          I had fixed beforehand the hour of my apparition to mankind, nothing could 
          hasten or delay it." <br><br>
          Impatient for enlightenment, Maurice asked for the second time: 
          "Still, what are you up to here?" <br><br>
          Joining her voice to his, Madame des Aubels asked: "Yes, indeed, what are 
          you doing here?" <br><br>
          The Angel replied: 
          "Man, lend your ear. Woman, hear my voice. <br><br>
          
          I am about to reveal to you a 
          secret on which hangs the fate of the Universe. <br><br>
          
          In rebellion against Him 
          whom you hold to be the Creator of all things visible and invisible, I am 
          preparing the Revolt of the Angels." <br><br>

          "Do not jest," said Maurice, who had faith and did not allow holy things to 
          be played with.<br><br> 
          
          
          But the Angel answered reproachfully: "What makes you think, Maurice, 
          that I am frivolous and given to vain words?" 
          "Come, come," said Maurice, shrugging his shoulders.<br><br> 
          
          "You are not going to 
          revolt against——" 
          He pointed to the ceiling—not daring to finish.<br><br> 
          
          
          But the Angel continued: 
          "Do you not know that the sons of God have already revolted and that a 
          great battle took place in the heavens?" 
          "That was a long time ago," said Maurice, putting on his socks.<br><br> 
          
          
          Then the Angel replied: 
          "It was before the creation of the world.<br><br> 
          
          But nothing has changed since then 
          in the heavens. The nature of the Angels is no different now from what it 
          was originally.<br><br>
          
          What they did then they could do again now." 
          "No! It is not possible. It is contrary to faith.<br><br>
          
          If you were an angel, a good 
          angel as you make out you are, it would never occur to you to disobey your 
          Creator." <br><br>
          
          "You are in error, Maurice, and the authority of the Fathers condemns you. <br><br>
          
          
          Origen lays it down in his homilies that good angels are fallible, that they sin 
          every day and fall from Heaven like flies. <br><br>
          
          Possibly you may be tempted to 
          reject the authority of this Father, despite his knowledge of the Scriptures, 
          because he is excluded from the Canon of the Saints. <br><br>
          
          If this be so, I would 
          remind you of the second chapter of Revelation, in which the Angels of 
          Ephesus and Pergamos are rebuked for that they kept not ward over their 
          church. <br><br>
          
          You will doubtless contend that the angels to whom the Apostle 
          here refers are, properly speaking, the Bishops of the two cities in question, 
          and that he calls them angels on account of their ministry. <br><br>
          
          It may be so, and 
          I cede the point. <br><br>
          
          But with what arguments, Maurice, would you counter the 
          opinion of all those Doctors and Pontiffs whose unanimous teaching it is 
          that angels may fall from good into evil? <br><br>
          
          Such is the statement made by 
          Saint Jerome in his Epistle to Damasus...." <br><br>


          "Monsieur," said Madame des Aubels, "go away, I beg you." 
          But the Angel hearkened not, and continued: 
          "Saint Augustine, in his True Religion, Chapter XIII; Saint Gregory, in his 
          Morals, Chapter XXIV; Isidore——" 
          "Monsieur, let me get my things on; I am in a hurry." 
          "In his treatise on The Greatest Good, Book I, Chapter XII; Bede on Job——" 
          "Oh, please, Monsieur ..." <br><br>

          "Chapter VIII; John of Damascus on Faith, Book II, Chapter III. <br><br>
          
          Those, I 
          think, are sufficiently weighty authorities, and there is nothing for it, 
          Maurice, but to admit your error. <br><br>
          
          What has led you astray is that you have 
          not duly considered my nature, which is free, active, and mobile, like that of 
          all the angels, and that you have merely observed the grace and felicity with 
          which you deem me so richly endowed. <br><br>
          
          Lucifer possessed no less, yet he 
          rebelled." <br><br>

          "But what on earth are you rebelling for?" asked Maurice. <br><br>
          
          
          "Isaiah," answered the child of light, "Isaiah has already asked, before you: 
          'Quomodo cecidisti de cœlo, Lucifer, qui mane oriebaris?' Hearken, Maurice. <br><br>
          
          
          Before Time was, the Angels rose up to win dominion over Heaven, the most 
          beautiful of the Seraphim revolted through pride. <br><br>
          
          As for me, it is science 
          that has inspired me with the generous desire for freedom. <br><br>
          
          Finding myself 
          near you, Maurice, in a house containing one of the vastest libraries in the 
          world, I acquired a taste for reading and a love of study. <br><br>
          
          While, fordone with 
          the toils of a sensual life, you lay sunk in heavy slumber, I surrounded 
          myself with books, I studied, I pondered over their pages, sometimes in one 
          of the rooms of the library, under the busts of the great men of antiquity, 
          sometimes at the far end of the garden, in the room in the summer-house 
          next to your own." <br><br>

          On hearing these words, young d'Esparvieu exploded with laughter and beat 
          the pillow with his fist, an infallible sign of uncontrollable mirth. <br><br>

          "Ah ... ah ... ah! It was you who pillaged papa's library and drove poor old 
          Sariette off his head. You know, he has become completely idiotic."<br><br>

          "Busily engaged," continued the Angel, "in cultivating for myself a sovereign 
          intelligence, I paid no heed to that inferior being, and when he thought to 
          offer obstacles to my researches and to disturb my work I punished him for 
          his importunity.<br><br>
          
          
          "One particular winter's night in the abode of the philosophers and globes I 
          let fall a volume of great weight on his head, which he tried to tear from my 
          invisible hand.<br><br>
          
          Then more recently, raising, with a vigorous arm composed 
          of a column of condensed air, a precious manuscript of Flavius Josephus, I 
          gave the imbecile such a fright, that he rushed out screaming on to the 
          landing and (to borrow a striking expression from Dante Alighieri) fell even 
          as a dead body falls.<br><br>
          
          He was well rewarded, for you gave him, Madame, to 
          staunch the blood from his wound, your little scented handkerchief.<br><br>
          
          It was 
          the day, you may remember, when behind a celestial globe you exchanged a 
          kiss on the mouth with Maurice." <br><br>

          "Monsieur," said Madame des Aubels, with a frown, "I cannot allow you...." 
          But she stopped short, deeming it was an inopportune moment to appear 
          over-exacting on a matter of decorum. <br><br>

          "I had made up my mind," continued the Angel impassively, "to examine the 
          foundations of belief.<br><br>
          
          I first attacked the monuments of Judaism, and I read 
          all the Hebrew texts.<br><br>
          
          " 
          "You know Hebrew, then?" exclaimed Maurice.<br><br>
          
          
          "Hebrew is my native tongue: in Paradise for a long time we have spoken 
          nothing else."<br><br>

          "Ah, you are a Jew. I might have deduced it from your want of tact." 
          The Angel, not deigning to hear, continued in his melodious voice: "I have 
          delved deep into Oriental antiquities and also into those of Greece and 
          Rome.<br><br>
          
          I have devoured the works of theologians, philosophers, physicists, 
          geologists, and naturalists. I have learnt. I have thought. I have lost my 
          faith." <br><br>

          "What? You no longer believe in God?" 
          "I believe in Him, since my existence depends on His, and if He should fail to 
          exist, I myself should fall into nothingness.<br><br>
          
          I believe in Him, even as the 
          Satyrs and the Mænads believed in Dionysus and for the same reason.<br><br>
          
          I 
          believe in the God of the Jews and the Christians.<br><br>
          
          But I deny that He 
          created the world; at the most He organised but an inferior part of it, and all 
          that He touched bears the mark of His rough and unforeseeing touch.<br><br>
          
          I do 
          not think He is either eternal or infinite, for it is absurd to conceive of a 
          being who is not bounded by space or time.<br><br>
          
          I think Him limited, even very 
          limited.<br><br>
          
          I no longer believe Him to be the only God.<br><br>
          
           For a long time He did 
          not believe it Himself; in the beginning He was a polytheist; later, His pride 
          and the flattery of His worshippers made Him a monotheist.<br><br>
          
          His ideas have 
          little connection; He is less powerful than He is thought to be.<br><br>
          
          And, to speak 
          candidly, He is not so much a god as a vain and ignorant demiurge.<br><br>
          
          Those 
          who, like myself, know His true nature, call Him Ialdabaoth." 
          "What's that you say?" 
          "Ialdabaoth." <br><br>

          "Ialdabaoth. What's that?" 
          "I have already told you. It is the demiurge whom, in your blindness, you 
          adore as the one and only God." <br><br>

          "You're mad. I don't advise you to go and talk rubbish like that to Abbé 
          Patouille." <br><br>

          "I am not in the least sanguine, my dear Maurice, of piercing the dense night 
          of your intellect.<br><br>
          
          I merely tell you that I am going to engage Ialdabaoth in 
          conflict with some hopes of victory." <br><br>

          "Mark my words, you won't succeed." 
          "Lucifer shook His throne, and the issue was for a moment in doubt." <br><br>

          "What is your name?" 
          "Abdiel for the angels and saints, Arcade for mankind." <br><br>

          "Well, my poor Arcade, I regret to see you going to the bad.<br><br>
          
          But confess that 
          you are jesting with us.<br><br>
          
          I could at a pinch understand your leaving Heaven 
          for a woman.<br><br>
          
          Love makes us commit the greatest follies.<br><br>
          
           But you will never 
          make me believe that you, who have seen God face to face, ultimately found 
          the truth in old Sariette's musty books.<br><br>
          
          No, you will never get me to believe 
          that!" <br><br>

          "My dear Maurice, Lucifer was face to face with God, yet he refused to serve 
          Him.<br><br>
          
          As to the kind of truth one finds in books, it is a truth that enables us 
          sometimes to discern what things are not, without ever enabling us to 
          discover what they are.<br><br>
          
          And this poor little truth has sufficed to prove to me 
          that He in whom I blindly believed is not believable, and that men and 
          angels have been deceived by the lies of Ialdabaoth." <br><br>

          "There is no Ialdabaoth. There is God. Come, Arcade, do the right thing.<br><br>
          
          
          Renounce these follies, these impieties, dis-incarnate yourself, become once 
          more a pure Spirit, and resume your office of guardian angel.<br><br>
          
          Return to 
          duty.<br><br>
          
          I forgive you, but do not let us see you again." <br><br>

          "I should like to please you, Maurice. I feel a certain affection for you, for my 
          heart is soft.<br><br>
          
          But fate henceforth calls me elsewhere towards beings capable 
          of thought and action." <br><br>

          "Monsieur Arcade," said Madame des Aubels, "withdraw, I implore you.<br><br>
           It 
          makes me horribly shy to be in this position before two men. I assure you I 
          am not accustomed to it."<br><br>
        </p>


        <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">RECOUNTS IN WHAT MANNER THE ANGEL, ATTIRED IN THE CAST-OFF 
          GARMENTS OF A SUICIDE, LEAVES THE YOUTHFUL MAURICE 
          WITHOUT A HEAVENLY GUARDIAN</p>

          <p>
            EASSURE yourself, Madame," replied the apparition, "your position is not as 
            risky as you say. <br><br>
            
            You are not confronted with two men, but with one man 
            and an angel." <br><br>

            She examined the stranger with an eye which, piercing the gloom, was 
            anxiously surveying a vague but by no means negligible indication, and 
            asked: 
            "Monsieur, is it quite certain that you are an angel?" <br><br>

            The apparition prayed her to have no doubt about it, and gave some precise 
            information as to his origin.<br><br>
            
            
            "There are three hierarchies of celestial spirits, each composed of nine 
            choirs; the first comprises the Seraphim, Cherubim, and the Thrones; the 
            second, the Dominations, the Virtues, and the Powers; the third, the 
            Principalities, the Archangels, and the Angels properly so called.<br><br>
            
            I belong to 
            the ninth choir of the third hierarchy." <br><br>

            Madame des Aubels, who had her reasons for doubting this, expressed at 
            least one: 
            "You have no wings." <br><br>

            "Why should I, Madame? Am I bound to resemble the angels on your holy
            water stoups? Those feathery oars that beat the waves of the air in rhythmic 
            cadences are not always worn by the heavenly messengers on their 
            shoulders.<br><br>
            
            Cherubim may be apterous.<br><br>
            
             That all too beautiful angelic pair 
            who spent an anxious night in the house of Lot compassed about by an 
            Oriental horde—they had no wings! No, they appeared just like men, and the 
            dust of the road covered their feet, which the patriarch washed with pious 
            hand.<br><br>
            
            I would beg you to observe, Madame, that according to the Science of 
            Organic Metamorphosis created by Lamarck and Darwin, the wings of birds 
            have been successively transformed into fore-feet in the case of quadrupeds 
            and into arms in the case of the Linnæan primates.<br><br>
            
            And you may remember, 
            Maurice, that by a rather annoying reversion to type, Miss Kate, your 
            English nurse, who used to be so fond of giving you a whipping, had arms 
            very like the pinions of a plucked fowl.<br><br>
            
            One may say, then, that a being 
            possessing both arms and wings is a monster and belongs to the 
            department of Teratology.<br><br>
            
            In Paradise we have Cherubim and Kerûbs in the 
            shape of winged bulls, but those are the clumsy inventions of an inartistic 
            god.<br><br>
            
            It is nevertheless true, quite true, that the Victories of the Temple of 
            Athena Nike on the Athenian Acropolis are beautiful, and possess both arms 
            and wings; it is also true that the Victory of Brescia is beautiful, with her 
            outstretched arms and her long wings folded on her mighty loins.<br><br>
            
            It is one of 
            the miracles of Greek genius to have known how to create harmonious 
            monsters.<br><br>
            
            The Greeks never err. The Moderns always." <br><br>

            "Yet on the whole," said Madame des Aubels, "you have not the look of a 
            pure Spirit." <br><br>

            "Nevertheless, I am one, Madame, if ever there was one.<br><br>
            
            And it ill becomes 
            you, who have been baptised, to doubt it.<br><br>
            
            Several of the Fathers, such as St. 
            Justin, Tertullian, Origen, and Clement of Alexandria thought that the 
            Angels were not purely spiritual, but possessed a body formed of some 
            subtile material.<br><br>
            
            This opinion has been rejected by the Church; hence I am 
            merely Spirit.<br><br>
            
            But what is spirit and what is matter? Formerly they were 
            contrasted as being two opposites, and now your human science tends to 
            reunite them as two aspects of the same thing.<br><br>
            
            It teaches that everything 
            proceeds from ether and everything returns to it, that the same movement 
            transforms the waves of air into stones and minerals, and that the atoms 
            scattered throughout illimitable space, form, by the varying speed of their 
            orbits, all the substance of this material world." <br><br>

            But Madame des Aubels was not listening. She had something on her mind, 
            and to put an end to her suspense, she asked: 
            "How long have you been here?" 
            "I came with Maurice." <br><br>

            "Well—that's a nice thing!" said she, shaking her head. But the Angel 
            continued with heavenly serenity: 
            "Everything in the Universe is circular, elliptical, or hyperbolic, and the 
            same laws which rule the stars govern this grain of dust. <br><br>
            
            In the original and 
            native movement of its substance, my body is spiritual, but it may affect, as 
            you perceive, this material state, by changing the rhythm of its elements." <br><br>

            Having thus spoken he sat down in a chair on Madame des Aubels' black 
            stockings. 
            A clock struck outside. <br><br>

            "Good heavens, seven o'clock!" exclaimed Gilberte.<br><br>
            
            "What am I to say to my 
            husband? He thinks I am at that tea-party in the Rue de Rivoli.<br><br>
            
            We are 
            dining with the La Verdelières to-night.<br><br>
            
            Go away immediately, Monsieur 
            Arcade.<br><br>
            
            I must get ready to go. I have not a second to lose." <br><br>

            The Angel replied that he would have willingly obeyed Madame des Aubels 
            had he been in a state to show himself decently in public, but that he could 
            not dream of appearing out of doors without any clothes. <br><br>
            
            "Were I to walk 
            naked in the street," he added, "I should offend a nation attached to its 
            ancient habits, habits which it has never examined.<br><br>
            
            They are the basis of all 
            moral systems.<br><br>
            
            Formerly," he added, "the angels, in revolt like myself, 
            manifested themselves to Christians under grotesque and ridiculous 
            appearances, black, horned, hairy, and cloven-footed.<br><br>
            
            Pure stupidity! They 
            were the laughing-stock of people of taste.<br><br>
            
            They merely frightened old 
            women and children and met with no success." <br><br>

            "It is true he cannot go out as he is," said Madame des Aubels with justice.<br><br>
            
            
            Maurice tossed his pyjamas and his slippers to the celestial messenger.<br><br>
            
            
            Regarded as outdoor habiliments they were not adequate.<br><br>
            
            Gilberte pressed 
            her lover to run at once in quest of other clothes.<br><br>
            
            He proposed to go and get 
            some from the concierge.<br><br>
            
            She was violently opposed to this.<br><br>
            
             It would, she 
            said, be madly imprudent to drag the concierge into such an affair.<br><br>
            
            
            "Do you want them to know that ..." she exclaimed.<br><br>
            
            
            She pointed to the Angel and was silent.<br><br>
            
            
            Young d'Esparvieu went out to seek a clothes-shop.<br><br>
            
            
            Meanwhile, Gilberte, who could not delay any longer for fear of causing a 
            horrible society scandal, turned on the light and dressed before the Angel.<br><br>
            
            
            She did it without any awkwardness, for she knew how to adapt herself to 
            circumstances; and she took it that in such an unheard-of encounter in 
            which heaven and earth were mingled in unutterable confusion it was 
            permissible to retrench in modesty.<br><br>
            
            
            Moreover, she knew that she possessed a good figure and had garments as 
            dainty as the fashion demanded.<br><br>
            
            As the apparition's sense of delicacy would 
            not permit him to don Maurice's pyjamas, Gilberte could not help observing 
            by the lamp-light that her suspicions were well-founded, and that angels 
            have the same appearance as men.<br><br>
            
            Curious to know if the appearance were 
            real or imaginary she asked the child of light if Angels were like monkeys, 
            who, to win women, merely lack money.<br><br>
            
            
            "Yes, Gilberte," replied Arcade, "Angels are capable of loving mortals.<br><br>
            
            It is the 
            teaching of the Scriptures. It is said in the Seventh Book of Genesis, 'When 
            men became numerous on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to 
            them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and 
            they took as wives all those which pleased them.'" <br><br>

            "Good heavens," cried Gilberte all at once, "I shall never be able to fasten my 
            dress; it hooks down the back." <br><br>

            When Maurice entered the room he found the Angel on his knees tying the 
            shoes of the woman taken in flagrante delicto. <br><br>

            Taking her muff and her bag off the table she said: 
            "I have not forgotten anything? No. Good-night, Monsieur Arcade.<br><br>
            
            Good
            night, Maurice.<br><br>
            
            I shall not forget to-day." And she vanished like a dream. 
            "Here," said Maurice, throwing the Angel a bundle of clothes.<br><br>
            
            
            The young man, having seen some dismal rags lying among clarionettes and 
            clyster-pipes in the window of a second-hand shop, had bought for nineteen 
            francs the cast-off suit of some wretched sable-clad mortal who had 
            committed suicide.<br><br>
            
            The Angel, with native majesty, took the garments and 
            put them on.<br><br>
            
            Worn by him, they took on an unexpected elegance.<br><br>
            
             He took a 
            step to the door.<br><br>
            
            
            "So you are leaving me," said Maurice. "It's settled, then? I very much fear 
            that, some day, you will bitterly regret this hasty action." <br><br>

            "I must not look back. Adieu, Maurice." <br><br>

            Maurice timidly slipped five louis into his hand.<br><br>

            "Adieu, Arcade." 
            But when the Angel had passed through the door, and all that was to be 
            seen of him in the door-way was his uplifted heel, Maurice called him back. <br><br>

            "Arcade! I never thought of it! I have no guardian angel now!" 
            "Quite true, Maurice, you have one no longer." <br><br>

            "Then what will become of me? One must have a guardian angel.<br><br>
             Tell me,—
            are there not grave drawbacks,—is there no danger in not having one?" 
            "Before replying, Maurice, I must ask you if you wish me to speak to you 
            according to your belief, which formerly was my own, according to the 
            teaching of the Church and the Catholic faith, or according to natural 
            philosophy." <br><br>

            "I don't care a straw for your natural philosophy. Answer me according to 
            the religion I believe in, and which I profess, and in which I wish to live and 
            die." <br><br>

            "Very well, my dear Maurice.<br><br>
            
            The loss of your guardian angel will probably 
            deprive you of certain spiritual succour, of certain celestial grace.<br><br>
            
            I am 
            expressing to you the unvarying opinion of the Church on the matter.<br><br>
            
            You 
            will lack an assistance, a support, a consolation which would have guided 
            and confirmed you in the way of salvation.<br><br>
            
            You will have less strength to 
            avoid sin, and as it was you hadn't much.<br><br>
            
            In fact, in spiritual matters, you 
            will be without strength and without joy.<br><br>
            
            Adieu, Maurice; when you see 
            Madame des Aubels, please remember me to her." 
            "You are going?" <br><br>

            "Farewell." 
            Arcade disappeared, and Maurice in the depths of an arm-chair sat for a 
            long time with his head in his hands.<br><br>
          </p>


        <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN IT IS SET FORTH HOW THE ANGEL MIRAR, WHEN BEARING 
          GRACE AND CONSOLATION TO THOSE DWELLING IN THE 
          NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE CHAMPS ÉLYSÉES IN PARIS, BEHELD A 
          MUSIC-HALL SINGER NAMED BOUCHOTTE AND FELL IN LOVE WITH 
          HERHROUGH </p>

          <p>
            streets filled with brown fog, pierced with white and yellow lights, where 
            horses exhaled their smoking breath and motors radiated their rapid 
            search-lights, the angel made his way, and, mingling with the black flood of 
            foot-passengers which rolled unceasingly along, proceeded across the town 
            from north to south till he came to the lonely boulevards on the left bank of 
            the river. <br><br>
            
            Not far from the old walls of Port Royal, a small restaurant flings 
            night by night athwart the pavement the clouded rays of its streaming 
            windows. <br><br>
            
            Coming to a halt there, Arcade entered a room full of warm, 
            savoury odours, pleasing to the unfortunate beings faint with cold and 
            hunger. <br><br>
            
            Glancing round him he beheld Russian Nihilists, Italian Anarchists, 
            refugees, conspirators, revolutionaries from every quarter of the globe, 
            picturesque old faces with tumbled masses of hair and beard that swept 
            downwards even as the torrent and the waterfall sweep over their rocky bed. <br><br>
            
            
            There were young faces of virginal coldness, expressions sombre and wild, 
            pale eyes of infinite sweetness, drawn faces, and, in a corner, there were two 
            Russian women, one extremely lovely, the other hideous, but both 
            resembling each other in their indifference to ugliness and to beauty. <br><br>
            
            But 
            failing to find the face he sought, for there were no angels in the room, he 
            sat down at a small vacant marble table. <br><br>
            
            
            Angels, when driven by hunger, eat as do the animals of this earth, and 
            their food, transformed by digestive heat, becomes one with their celestial 
            substance. <br><br>
            
            Seeing three angels under the oaks of Mamre, Abraham offered 
            them cakes, kneaded by Sarah, an whole calf, butter and milk, and they ate. <br><br>
            
            
            Lot, on receiving two angels in his house, ordered unleavened bread to be 
            baked, and they did eat. <br><br>
            
            Arcade was given a tough beef-steak by a seedy 
            waiter, and he did eat. <br><br>
            
            Nevertheless, his dreams were of the sweet leisure, of 
            the repose, of the delightful studies he had quitted, of the heavy task he had 
            undertaken, of the toil, the weariness, the perils which he would have to 
            endure, and his soul was sad and his heart troubled. <br><br>
            
            
            As he was finishing his modest repast, a young man of poor appearance and 
            thinly clad entered the room, and rapidly surveying the tables approached 
            the angel and greeted him by the name of Abdiel, because he himself was a 
            celestial spirit. <br><br>
            
            
            "I knew you would answer my call, Mirar," replied Arcade, addressing his 
            angelic brother in his turn by the name he formerly bore in heaven. <br><br>
            
            But 
            Mirar was remembered no more in heaven since he, an Archangel, had left 
            the service of God. <br><br>
            
            He was called Théophile Belais on earth, and to earn his 
            bread gave music lessons to small children in the day-time and at night 
            played the violin in dancing saloons. <br><br>
            
            
            "It is you, dear Abdiel?" replied Théophile. <br><br>
            
            "So here we are reunited in this 
            sad world. <br><br>
            
            I am pleased to see you again. <br><br>
            
             All the same I pity you, for we lead 
            a hard life here." <br><br>
            
             
            But Arcade answered: 
            "Friend, your exile draws to an end. <br><br>
            
            I have great plans. <br><br>
            
             I will confide them to 
            you and associate you with them." <br><br>

            And Maurice's guardian angel, having ordered two coffees, revealed his ideas 
            and his projects to his companion: he told how, during his visit on earth, he 
            had abandoned himself to researches little practised by celestial spirits and 
            had studied theologies, cosmogonies, the system of the Universe, theories of 
            matter, modern essays on the transformation and loss of energy. <br><br>
            
            Having, he 
            explained, studied Nature, he had found her in perpetual conflict with the 
            teachings of the Master he served. <br><br>
            
            This Master, greedy of praise, whom he 
            had for a long time adored, appeared to him now as an ignorant, stupid, and 
            cruel tyrant. <br><br>
            
            He had denied Him, blasphemed Him, and was burning to 
            combat Him. <br><br>
            
            His plan was to recommence the revolt of the angels. <br><br>
            
             He 
            wished for war, and hoped for victory. <br><br>
            
            
            "But," he added, "it is necessary above all to know our strength and that of 
            our adversary."<br><br>
            
            And he asked if the enemies of Ialdabaoth were numerous 
            and powerful on earth.<br><br>
            
            
            Théophile looked wonderingly at his brother.<br><br>
            
            He appeared not to understand 
            the questions addressed him.<br><br>
            
            
            "Dear compatriot," he said, "I came at your invitation because it was the 
            invitation of an old comrade.<br><br>
            
            But I do not know what you expect of me, and I 
            fear I shall be unable to help you in anything.<br><br>
            
            I take no hand in politics, 
            neither do I stand forth as a reformer.<br><br>
            
            I am not like you, a spirit in revolt, a 
            freethinker, a revolutionary.<br><br>
            
            I remain faithful, in the depths of my soul, to 
            the Celestial Creator.<br><br>
            
            I still adore the Master I no longer serve, and I lament 
            the days when shrouding myself with my wings I formed with the multitude 
            of the children of light a wheel of flame around His throne of glory.<br><br>
            
            Love, 
            profane love has alone separated me from God.<br><br>
            
            I quitted heaven to follow a 
            daughter of men.<br><br>
            
            She was beautiful and sang in music-halls." <br><br>

            They rose. Arcade accompanied Théophile, who was living at the other end 
            of the town, at the corner of the Boulevard Rochechouart and the Rue de 
            Steinkerque.<br><br>
            
            While walking through the deserted streets he who loved the 
            singer told his brother of his love and his sorrows.<br><br>
            
            
            His fall, which dated from two years back, had been sudden.<br><br>
            
            Belonging to 
            the eighth choir of the third hierarchy he was a bearer of grace to the 
            faithful who are still to be found in large numbers in France, especially 
            among the higher ranks of the officers of the army and navy.<br><br>
            
            
            "One summer night," he said, "as I was descending from Heaven, to 
            distribute consolations, the grace of perseverance and of good deaths to 
            divers pious persons in the neighbourhood of the Étoile, my eyes, although 
            well accustomed to immortal light, were dazzled by the fiery flowers with 
            which the Champs Élysées were sown.<br><br>
            
            Great candelabra, under the trees, 
            marking the entrances to cafés and restaurants, gave the foliage the 
            precious glitter of an emerald.<br><br>
            
            Long garlands of luminous pearl surrounded 
            the open-air enclosures where a crowd of men and women sat closely 
            packed listening to the sounds of a lively orchestra, whose strains reached 
            my ears confusedly.<br><br>
            
            
            "The night was warm, my wings were beginning to grow tired.<br><br>
            
            I descended 
            into one of the concerts and sat down, invisible, among the audience.<br><br>
            
            At this 
            moment, a woman appeared on the stage, clad in a short spangled frock.<br><br>
            
            
            Owing to the reflection of the footlights and the paint on her face all that 
            was visible of the latter was the expression and the smile.<br><br>
            
            Her body was 
            supple and voluptuous.<br><br>
            
            
            "She sang and danced.... Arcade, I have always loved dancing and music, 
            but this creature's thrilling voice and insidious movements created in me an 
            uneasiness I had never known before.<br><br>
            
            My colour came and went.<br><br>
            
             My eyelids 
            drooped, my tongue clove to my mouth.<br><br>
            
            I could not leave the spot." <br><br>

            And Théophile related, groaning, how, possessed by desire for this woman, 
            he did not return to Heaven again, but, taking the shape of a man, lived an 
            earthly life, for it is written: "In those days the sons of God saw that the 
            daughters of men were beautiful." <br><br>

            A fallen angel, having lost his innocence along with the vision of God, 
            Théophile at heart still retained his simplicity of soul.<br><br>
            
            Clad in rags, filched 
            from the stall of a Jewish hawker, he went to seek the woman he loved.<br><br>
            
            She 
            was called Bouchotte and lodged in a small house in Montmartre.<br><br>
            
            He flung 
            himself at her feet and told her she was adorable, that she sang delightfully, 
            that he loved her madly, that, for her, he would renounce his family and his 
            country, that he was a musician and had nothing to eat.<br><br>
            
            Touched by such 
            youthful ingenuousness, candour, poverty, and love, she fed, clothed, and 
            loved him.<br><br>
            
            
            However, after long and painful struggles, he procured employment as a 
            music-teacher, and made some money, which he brought to his mistress, 
            keeping nothing for himself.<br><br>
            
            From that time forward she loved him no 
            longer.<br><br>
            
            She despised him for earning so little and did not conceal her 
            indifference, weariness, and disgust.<br><br>
            
            She overwhelmed him with reproaches, 
            irony, and abuse, in spite of which she kept him, for she had had experience 
            of worse partners and was used to domestic quarrels.<br><br>
            
            For the rest, she led a 
            busy, serious, and rather hard life as artist and woman.<br><br>
            
            Théophile loved her 
            as he had loved her the first night, and he suffered.<br><br>
            
            
            "She overworks herself," he told his celestial brother, "that is what makes 
            her so hard to please, but I am certain she loves me. I hope soon to give her 
            more comfort." <br><br>

            And he spoke at length of an operetta at which he was working and which 
            he hoped to have brought out at a Paris theatre.<br><br>
            
            A young poet had given him 
            the libretto.<br><br>
            
            It was the story of Aline, queen of Golconda, after an eighteenth
            century tale.<br><br>
            
            
            "I am strewing it profusely with melodies," said Théophile; "my music comes 
            from my heart.<br><br>
            
            My heart is an inexhaustible source of melody.<br><br>
            
             Unfortunately 
            nowadays people like recondite arrangements, difficult scoring.<br><br>
            
            They accuse 
            me of being too fluid, too limpid, of not imparting enough colour to my style, 
            not aiming at stronger effects in harmony and more vigorous contrasts.<br><br>
            
            
            Harmony, harmony!... No doubt it has given its merits, but it does not 
            appeal to the heart.<br><br>
            
            It is melody which carries us away and ravishes us and 
            brings smiles and tears to our eyes." At these words he smiled and wept to 
            himself.<br><br>
            
            Then he continued with emotion: 
            "I am a fountain of melody.<br><br>
            
            But the orchestration! there's the rub! In 
            Paradise, you know, Arcade, in the matter of instruments, we only possess 
            the harp, the psaltery, and the hydraulic organ." <br><br>

            Arcade was only listening to him with half an ear. He was meditating plans 
            which filled his soul and swelled his heart.<br><br>
            
            
            "Do you know any angels in revolt?" he asked his companion.<br><br>
            
            "As for me, I 
            know only one, Prince Istar, with whom I have exchanged a few letters and 
            who offered to share his attic with me while I was finding a lodging in this 
            town, where I believe rents are very high." <br><br>

            Of angels in revolt Théophile knew none.<br><br>
            
            When he met a fallen spirit who 
            had formerly been one of his comrades he shook him by the hand, for he 
            was a faithful friend.<br><br>
            
            Sometimes he saw Prince Istar.<br><br>
            
             But he avoided all 
            those bad angels who shocked him by the violence of their opinions and 
            whose conversations plagued him to death.<br><br>
            
            
            "Then you don't approve of me?" asked the impulsive Arcade.<br><br>
            
            
            "Friend, I neither approve of you nor blame you.<br><br>
            
            I understand nothing of the 
            ideas which trouble you.<br><br>
            
            Neither do I think it good for an artist to concern 
            himself with politics.<br><br>
            
            One has quite sufficient to occupy oneself with one's 
            art." <br><br>

            He loved his profession, and had hopes of "arriving" one day, but theatrical 
            ways disgusted him.<br><br>
            
            The only chance he saw of having his piece played was 
            to take one or two—perhaps three—collaborators, who, without having done 
            any work, would sign their names and share the profits.<br><br>
            
            Soon Bouchotte 
            would fail to find engagements.<br><br>
            
            When she offered her services in some small 
            hall the manager began by asking her how many shares she was taking in 
            the business.<br><br>
            
            Such customs, thought Théophile, were deplorable.<br><br>
            
             

          </p>


        <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN WE HEAR THE BEAUTIFUL ARCHANGEL ZITA UNFOLD HER 
          LOFTY DESIGNS AND ARE SHOWN THE WINGS OF MIRAR, ALL MOTH
          EATEN, IN A CUPBOARD</p>

          <p>
            HUS talking, the two archangels had reached the Boulevard Rochechouart. <br><br>
            
            
            As his eye lighted on a tavern, whence, through the mist, the light fell golden 
            on the pavement, Théophile suddenly bethought himself of the Archangel 
            Ithuriel who, in the guise of a poor but beautiful woman, was living in 
            wretched lodgings on La Butte and came every evening to read the papers at 
            this tavern. <br><br>
            
            The musician often met her there. <br><br>
            
             Her name was Zita. <br><br>
            
             Théophile 
            had never been curious enough to enquire into the opinions entertained by 
            this archangel, but it was generally supposed that she was a Russian 
            nihilist, and he took her to be, like Arcade, an atheist and a revolutionary. <br><br>
            
            
            He had heard remarkable tales about her. <br><br>
            
            People said she was an 
            hermaphrodite, and that as the active and passive principles were united 
            within her in a condition of stable equilibrium, she was an example of a 
            perfect being, finding in herself complete and continuous satisfaction, 
            contented yet unfortunate in that she knew not desire. <br><br>
            
            
            "But," added Théophile, "I have my doubts about it. <br><br>
            
            I believe she's a woman 
            and subject to love, like everything else that has life and breath in the 
            Universe. <br><br>
            
            Besides, someone caught her one day kissing her hand to a 
            strapping peasant fellow." <br><br>

            He offered to introduce his companion to her.<br><br>
            
            
            The two angels found her alone, reading.<br><br>
            
            As they drew near she lifted her 
            great eyes in whose deeps of molten gold little sparks of light were forever a
            dance.<br><br>
            
            Her brows were contracted into that austere fold which we see on the 
            forehead of the Pythian Apollo; her nose was perfect and descended without 
            a 
            curve; her lips were compressed and imparted a disdainful and 
            supercilious air to her whole countenance.<br><br>
            
            Her tawny hair, with its gleaming 
            lights, was carelessly adorned with the tattered remnants of a huge bird of 
            prey, her garments lay about her in dark and shapeless folds.<br><br>
            
            She was 
            leaning her chin on a small ill-tended hand.<br><br>
            
            
            Arcade, who had but recently heard references made to this powerful 
            archangel, showed her marked esteem, and placed entire confidence in her.<br><br>
            
            
            He immediately proceeded to tell of the progress his mind had made towards 
            knowledge and liberty, of his lucubrations in the d'Esparvieu library, of his 
            philosophical reading, his studies of nature, his works on exegesis, his 
            anger and his contempt when he recognised the deception of the demiurge, 
            his voluntary exile among mankind, and, finally, of his project to stir up 
            rebellion in Heaven.<br><br>
            
            Ready to dare all against an odious master, whom he 
            pursued with inextinguishable hatred, he expressed his profound happiness 
            at finding in Ithuriel a mind capable of counselling and helping him in his 
            great undertaking.<br><br>
            
            
            "You are not a very old hand at revolutions," said Zita, smiling.<br><br>
            
            
            Nevertheless, she doubted neither his sincerity nor the firmness of his 
            declared resolve, and she congratulated him on his intellectual audacity.<br><br>
            
            
            "That is what is most lacking in our people," she said, "they do not think." <br><br>

            And she added almost immediately: "But on what can intelligence sharpen 
            its wits, in a country where the climate is soft and existence made easy? <br><br>

            Even here, where necessity calls for intellectual activity, nothing is rarer 
            than a person who thinks." <br><br>

            "Nevertheless," replied Maurice's guardian angel, "man has created science.<br><br>
            
            
            The important thing is to introduce it into Heaven.<br><br>
            
            When the angels possess 
            some notions of physics, chemistry, astronomy, and physiology; when the 
            study of matter shows them worlds in an atom, and an atom in the myriads 
            of planets; when they see themselves lost between these two infinities; when 
            they weigh and measure the stars, analyse their composition, and calculate 
            their orbits, they will recognise that these monsters work in obedience to 
            forces which no intelligence can define, or that each star has its particular 
            divinity, or indigenous god; and they will realise that the gods of Aldebaran, 
            Betelgeuse, and Sirius are greater than Ialdabaoth.<br><br>
            
            When at length they 
            come to scrutinise with care the little world in which their lot is cast, and, 
            piercing the crust of the earth, note the gradual evolution of its flora and 
            fauna and the rude origin of man, who, under the shelter of rocks and in 
            cave dwellings, had no God but himself; when they discover that, united by 
            the bonds of universal kinship to plants, beasts, and men, they have 
            successively indued all forms of organic life, from the simplest and the most 
            primitive, until they became at length the most beautiful of the children of 
            light, they will perceive that Ialdabaoth, the obscure demon of an 
            insignificant world lost in space, is imposing on their credulity when he 
            pretends that they issued from nothingness at his bidding; they will perceive 
            that he lies in calling himself the Infinite, the Eternal, the Almighty, and 
            that, so far from having created worlds, he knows neither their number nor 
            their laws.<br><br>
            
            They will perceive that he is like unto one of them; they will 
            despise him, and, shaking off his tyranny, will fling him into the Gehenna 
            where he has hurled those more worthy than himself." <br><br>

            "Do you think so?" murmured Zita, puffing out the smoke of her cigarette.... <br><br>

            "Nevertheless, this knowledge by virtue of which you reckon to enfranchise 
            Heaven, has not destroyed religious sentiment on earth.<br><br>
            
            In countries where 
            they have set up and taught this science of physics, of chemistry, 
            astronomy, and geology, which you think capable of delivering the world, 
            Christianity has retained almost all its sway.<br><br>
            
            If the positive sciences have 
            had such a feeble influence on the beliefs of mankind, it is not likely they 
            will exercise a greater one on the opinions of the angels, and nothing is of 
            such dubious efficacy as scientific propaganda.<br><br>
            
            " 
            "What!" exclaimed Arcade, "you deny that Science has given the Church its 
            death-blow? Is it possible? The Church, at any rate, judges otherwise.<br><br>
            
            
            Science, which you believe has no power over her, is redoubtable to her, 
            since she proscribes it.<br><br>
            
            From Galileo's dialogues to Monsieur Aulard's little 
            manuals she has condemned all its discoveries.<br><br>
            
            And not without reason.<br><br>
            
             
            "In former days, when she gathered within her fold all that was great in 
            human thought, the Church held sway over the bodies as well as over the 
            souls of men, and imposed unity of obedience by fire and sword.<br><br>
            
            To-day her 
            power is but a shadow and the elect among the great minds have withdrawn 
            from her.<br><br>
            
            That is the state to which Science has reduced her." <br><br>

            "Possibly," replied the beautiful archangel, "but how slowly, with what 
            vicissitudes, at the price of what efforts, of what sacrifices!"<br><br>

            Zita did not absolutely condemn scientific propaganda, but she anticipated 
            no prompt or certain results from it.<br><br>
            
            For her it was not so much a question 
            of enlightening the angels; the important thing was to enfranchise them.<br><br>
            
            In 
            her opinion one only exerted a strong influence on individuals, whoever they 
            might be, by rousing their passions, and appealing to their interests.<br><br>
            
            
            "Persuade the angels that they will cover themselves with glory by 
            overthrowing the tyrant, and that they will be happier once they are free; 
            that is the most practical policy to attempt, and, for my own part, I am 
            devoting all my energies to its fulfilment.<br><br>
            
            It is certainly no light task, 
            because the Kingdom of Heaven is a military autocracy and there is no 
            public opinion in it.<br><br>
            
            Nevertheless, I do not despair of starting an intellectual 
            movement.<br><br>
            
            I do not wish to boast, but no one is more closely acquainted 
            than I with the different classes of angelic society." <br><br>

            Throwing away her cigarette, Zita pondered for a moment, then, amid the 
            click of ivory balls on the billiard table, the clinking of glasses, the curt 
            voices of the players announcing their points, the monotonous answers of 
            the waiters to their customers, the Archangel enumerated the entire 
            population of the spirits of light. <br><br>

            "We must not count on the Dominations, the Virtues, nor the Powers, which 
            compose the celestial lower middle class. <br><br>
            
            I have no need to tell you, for you 
            know it as well as I, how selfish, base, and cowardly the middle classes are. <br><br>


            As to the great dignitaries, the Ministers, the Generals, Thrones, Cherubim, 
            and Seraphim, you know what they are; they will take no action. <br><br>
            
            Let us, 
            however, once prove ourselves the stronger, and we shall have them with us. <br><br>


            For if autocrats do not readily acquiesce in their own downfall, once 
            overthrown, all their forces recoil upon themselves. <br><br>
            
            It will be well to work the 
            Army. <br><br>
            
            Entirely loyal as the Army is, it will allow itself to be influenced by a 
            clever anarchist propaganda. <br><br>
            
            But our greatest and most constant efforts 
            ought to be brought to bear upon the angels of your own category, Arcade; 
            the guardian angels, who dwell upon earth in such great numbers. <br><br>
            
            They fill 
            the lowest ranks of the hierarchy, are for the most part discontented with 
            their lot, and more or less imbued with the ideas of the present century."<br><br>
            
            
            She had already conferred with the guardian angels of Montmartre, 
            Clignancourt, and Filles-du-Calvaire. <br><br>
            
            She had devised the plan of a vast 
            association of Spirits on Earth with the view of conquering Heaven. <br><br>


            "To accomplish this task," she said, "I have established myself in France. <br><br>


            But not because I had the folly to believe myself freer in a republic than in a 
            monarchy. <br><br>
            
            Quite the contrary, for there is no country where the liberty of 
            the individual is less respected than in France. <br><br>
            
            But the people are 
            indifferent to everything connected with religion; nowhere else, therefore, 
            should I enjoy such tranquillity."<br><br>
            
            
            She invited Arcade to unite his efforts to hers, and when they separated at 
            the door of the brasserie the steel shutter was already making its groaning 
            descent. <br><br>


            "Above all," said Zita, "you must meet the gardener. <br><br>
            
            I will take you to his 
            rustic home one day."<br><br>
            
            
            Théophile, who had slumbered during all this talk, begged his friend to come 
            home with him and smoke a cigarette. <br><br>
            
            He lived quite near in the small street 
            opposite, leading off the Boulevard. <br><br>
            
            Arcade would see Bouchotte, she would 
            please him. <br><br>


            They climbed up five flights of stairs. <br><br>
            
            Bouchotte had not yet returned. <br><br>
            
            A tin 
            of sardines lay open on the piano. <br><br>
            
            Red stockings coiled about the arm
            chairs. <br><br>


            "It's a little place, but it's comfortable," said Théophile. <br><br>


            And gazing out of the window which looked out on the russet-coloured 
            night, with its myriad lights, he added, "One can see the Sacré Cœur."<br><br>
            
            His 
            hand on Arcade's shoulder, he repeated several times, "I am glad to see 
            you." <br><br>

            Then, dragging his former companion in glory into the kitchen passage, he 
            put down his candlestick, drew a key from his pocket, opened a cupboard, 
            and, raising a linen covering, disclosed two large white wings. <br><br>


            "You see," he said, "I have preserved them. <br><br>
            
            From time to time, when I am 
            alone, I go and look at them; it does me good."<br><br>
            
            
            And he dabbed his reddened eyes. He stood awhile, overcome by silent 
            emotion. <br><br>
            
            Then, holding the candle near the long pinions which were 
            moulting their down in places, he murmured, "They are eaten away."<br><br>
            
            
            "You must put some pepper on them," said Arcade. <br><br>


            "I have done so," replied the angelic musician, sighing. <br><br>
            
            "I have put pepper, 
            camphor, and powder on them. <br><br>
            
            But nothing does any good."<br><br>
            
            

          </p>


        <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHICH REVEALS THE CHERUB TOILING FOR THE WELFARE OF 
          HUMANITY AND CONCLUDES IN AN ENTIRELY NOVEL MANNER WITH 
          THE MIRACLE OF THE FLUTE </p>

          <p>
            THE first night of his incarnation Arcade slept at the angel Istar's, in a garret 
            in that narrow, gloomy Rue Mazarine which wallows along beneath the 
            shadow of the old Institute of France. <br><br>
            
            Istar, who had been expecting him, 
            had pushed against the wall the shattered retorts, cracked pots, broken 
            bottles, and odds and ends of iron stoves, which made up the furniture of 
            his room, and spread his clothes on the floor to lie on, leaving his guest his 
            folding-bed with its straw mattress. <br><br>


            The celestial spirits differ from one another in appearance according to the 
            hierarchy and the choir to which they belong, and according to their own 
            particular nature. <br><br>
            
            They are all beautiful; but in different fashion, and they 
            do not all offer to the eye the soft contours and dimpling smiles of childhood 
            with its rosy lights and pearly tints. <br><br>
            
            Nor do they all adorn themselves with 
            eternal youth, that indefinable beauty that Greek art in its decline has 
            imparted to its most lovingly handled marbles, and whereof Christian 
            painters have so often timidly essayed to give us veiled and softened 
            imitations. <br><br>
            
            In some of them the chin glows with tufts of hair, and the limbs 
            are furnished with such vigorous muscles that it seems as if serpents were 
            writhing beneath the skin. <br><br>
            
            Some have no wings, others possess two, four, or 
            six; others again are formed entirely of conjoined pinions. <br><br>
            
            Many, and these 
            not the least illustrious, take the form of superb monsters, such as the 
            Centaurs of fable; nay, one may even see some who are living chariots, and 
            wheels of fire. <br><br>
            
            A member of the highest celestial hierarchy, Istar belonged to 
            the choir of Cherubim or Kerûbs who see above them the Seraphim alone. <br><br>
            
            In 
            common with all the angelic spirits of his rank he had formerly borne in 
            Heaven the bodily shape of a winged bull surmounted by the head of a 
            horned and bearded man, and carrying between his loins the attributes of 
            generous fecundity. <br><br>
            
            He was vaster and more vigorous than any animal on 
            earth, and when he stood erect with outspread wings he covered with his 
            shadow sixty archangels. <br><br>


            Such was Istar in his native home. <br><br>
            
            There he radiated strength and 
            sweetness. <br><br>
            
            His heart was full of courage and his soul benevolent. <br><br>
            
            Moreover, 
            in those days he loved his lord. <br><br>
            
            He believed him to be good and yielded him 
            faithful service. <br><br>
            
            But even while guarding the portals of his Master, he used 
            to ponder unceasingly on the punishment of the rebellious angels and the 
            curse of Eve. <br><br>
            
            His mind worked slowly but profoundly. <br><br>
            
            When, after a long 
            course of centuries, he persuaded himself that Ialdabaoth in creating the 
            world had created evil and death, he ceased to adore and to serve him. <br><br>
            
            His 
            love changed to hatred, his veneration to contempt. <br><br>
            
            He shouted his 
            execrations in his face, and fled to earth. <br><br>


            Embodied in human form and reduced to the stature of the sons of Adam, 
            he still retained some characteristics of his former nature. <br><br>
            
            His big 
            protruding eyes, his beaked nose, his thick lips framed in a black beard 
            which descended in curls on to his chest recalled those Cherubs of the 
            tabernacle of Iahveh, of which the bulls of Nineveh afford us a pretty 
            accurate representation. <br><br>
            
            He bore the name of Istar on earth as well as in 
            Heaven, and although exempt from vanity and free from all social prejudice, 
            he was immensely desirous of showing himself sincere and truthful in all 
            things. <br><br>
            
            He therefore proclaimed the illustrious rank in which his birth had 
            placed him in the celestial hierarchy and translated into French his title of 
            Cherub by the equivalent one of Prince, calling himself Prince Istar. <br><br>
            
            Seeking 
            shelter among mankind he had developed an ardent love for them. <br><br>
            
            While 
            awaiting the coming of the hour when he should deliver Heaven from 
            bondage, he dreamed of the salvation of regenerate humanity and was eager 
            to consummate the destruction of this wicked world, in order to raise upon 
            its ashes, to the sound of the lyre, a city radiant with happiness and love. <br><br>
            
            A 
            chemist in the pay of a dealer in nitrates, he lived very frugally. <br><br>
            
            He wrote for 
            newspapers with advanced views on liberty, spoke at public meetings, and 
            had got himself sentenced several times to several months' imprisonment for 
            anti-militarism. <br><br>


            Istar greeted his brother Arcade cordially, approved of his rupture with the 
            party of crime, and informed him of the descent of fifty of the children of 
            light who, at the present moment, formed a colony near Val de Grace, 
            imbued with a really excellent spirit. <br><br>


            "It is simply raining angels in Paris," he said, laughing. <br><br>
            
            "Every day some 
            dignitary of the sacred palace falls on one's head, and soon the Sultan of the 
            Cherubs will have no one to make into Vizirs or guards but the little 
            unbreeched vagabonds of his pigeon coops."<br><br>
            
            
            Soothed by the good news, Arcade fell asleep, full of happiness and hope. <br><br>


            He awoke in the early dawn and saw Prince Istar bending over his furnaces, 
            his retorts, and his test tubes. <br><br>
            
            Prince Istar was working for the good of 
            humanity. <br><br>


            Every morning when Arcade woke he saw Prince Istar fulfilling his work of 
            tenderness and love. <br><br>
            
            Sometimes the Kerûb, huddled up with his head in his 
            hands, would softly murmur a few chemical formulæ; at others, drawing 
            himself up to his full height, like a dark naked column, with his head, his 
            arms, nay, his entire bust clean out of the sky-light window, he would 
            deposit his melting-pot on the roof, fearing the perquisition with which he 
            was constantly menaced. <br><br>
            
            Moved by an immense pity for the miseries of the 
            world wherein he dwelt in exile, conscious perhaps of the rumours to which 
            his name gave rise, inebriated with his own virtue, he played the part of 
            apostle to the Human Race, and neglecting the task he had undertaken in 
            coming to earth, he forgot all about the emancipation of the angels. <br><br>
            
            Arcade, 
            who, on the contrary, dreamed of nothing else but of conquering Heaven and 
            returning thither in triumph, reproached the Cherub with forgetting his 
            native land. <br><br>


            Prince Istar, with a great frank, uncouth laugh, acknowledged that he had 
            no preference for angels over men. <br><br>


            "If I am doing my best," he replied to his celestial brother, "if I am doing my 
            best to stir up France and Europe, it is because the day is dawning which 
            will behold the triumph of the social revolution. <br><br>
            
            It is a pleasure to cast one's 
            seed on ground so well prepared. <br><br>
            
            The French having passed fromfeudalism 
            to monarchy, and from monarchy to a financial oligarchy, will easily pass 
            from a financial oligarchy to anarchy."<br><br>
            
            
            "How erroneous it is," retorted Arcade, "to believe in great and sudden 
            changes in the social order in Europe! The old order is still young in 
            strength and power. <br><br>
            
            The means of defence at her disposal are formidable. <br><br>


            On the other hand, the proletariat's plan of defensive organisation is of the 
            vaguest description and brings merely weakness and confusion to the 
            struggle. <br><br>
            
            In our celestial country all goes quite otherwise. <br><br>
            
            Beneath an 
            apparently unchangeable exterior all is rotten within. <br><br>
            
            A mere push would 
            suffice to overturn an edifice which has not been touched for millions of 
            centuries. <br><br>
            
            Out-worn administration, out-worn army, out-worn finance, the 
            whole thing is more worm-eaten than either the Russian or Persian 
            autocracy."<br><br>
            
            
            And the kindly Arcade adjured the Cherub to fly first to the aid of his 
            brethren who, though dwelling amid the soft clouds with the sound of 
            citterns and their cups of paradisal wine around them, were in more 
            wretched plight than mankind bowed over the grudging earth. <br><br>
            
            For the latter 
            have a conception of justice, while the angels rejoice in iniquity. <br><br>
            
            He exhorted 
            him to deliver the Prince of Light and his stricken companions and to re
            establish them in their ancient honours. <br><br>


            Prince Istar allowed himself to be convinced. <br><br>


            He promised to put the sweet persuasiveness of his words and the excellent 
            formulæ of his explosives at the service of the celestial revolution. <br><br>
            
            He gave 
            his promise. <br><br>


            "To-morrow," he said. <br><br>


            And when the morrow came he continued his anti-militarist propaganda at 
            Issy-les-Moulineaux. <br><br>
            
            Like the Titan Prometheus, Istar loved mankind. <br><br>


            Arcade, suffering from all the desires to which the sons of Adam are 
            subjected, found himself lacking in resources to satisfy them. <br><br>
            
            Istar gave him 
            a start in a printing house in the Rue de Vaugirard where he knew the 
            foreman. <br><br>
            
            Arcade, thanks to his celestial intelligence, soon knew how to set 
            up type and became, in a short time, a good compositor. <br><br>


            After standing all day in the whirring workroom, holding the composing
            stick in his left hand, and swiftly drawing the little leaden signs from the 
            case in the order required by the copy fixed in the visorium, he would go and 
            wash his hands at the pump and dine at the corner bar, a newspaper 
            propped up before him on the marble table. <br><br>
            
            Being now no longer invisible, 
            he could not make his way into the d'Esparvieu library, and was thus 
            debarred from allaying his ardent thirst for knowledge at that inexhaustible 
            source. <br><br>
            
            He went, of an evening, to read at the library of Ste. 
            
            Geneviève on 
            the famous hill of learning, but there were only ordinary books to be had 
            there; greasy things, covered with ridiculous annotations, and lacking many 
            pages. <br><br>


            The sight of women troubled and unsettled him. <br><br>
            
            He would remember 
            Madame des Aubels and her charm, and, although he was handsome, he 
            was not loved, because of his poverty and his workaday clothes. <br><br>
            
            He saw 
            much of Zita, and took a certain pleasure in going for walks with her on 
            Sundays along the dusty roads which edge the grass-grown trenches of the 
            fortifications. <br><br>
            
            They wandered, the pair of them, by wayside inns, market
            gardens, and green retreats, propounding and discussing the vastest plans 
            that ever stirred the world, and, occasionally, as they passed along by some 
            travelling circus, the steam organ of the merry-go-round would furnish an 
            accompaniment to their words as they breathed fire and fury against 
            Heaven. <br><br>


            Zita used often to say: 
            "Istar means well, but he's a simple fellow. <br><br>
            
            He believes in the goodness of 
            men and things. <br><br>
            
            He undertakes the destruction of the old world and 
            imagines that anarchy of itself will create order and harmony. <br><br>
            
            You, Arcade, 
            you believe in Science; you deem that men and angels are capable of 
            understanding, whereas, in point of fact, they are only creatures of 
            sentiment. <br><br>
            
            You may be quite sure that nothing is to be obtained from them 
            by appealing to their intelligence; one must rouse their interests and their 
            passions."<br><br>
            
            
            Arcade, Istar, Zita, and three or four other angelic conspirators occasionally 
            foregathered in Théophile Belais' little flat, where Bouchotte gave them tea. <br><br>


            Though she did not know that they were rebellious angels, she hated them 
            instinctively, and feared them, for she had had a Christian education, albeit 
            she had sadly failed to keep it up. <br><br>


            Prince Istar alone pleased her; she thought there was something kind
            hearted and an air of natural distinction about him. <br><br>
            
            He stove in the sofa, 
            broke down the arm-chairs, and tore corners off sheets of music to make 
            notes, which he thrust into pockets invariably crammed with pamphlets and 
            bottles. <br><br>
            
            The musician used to gaze sorrowfully at the manuscript of his 
            operetta, Aline, Queen of Golconda, with its corners all torn off. <br><br>
            
            The prince 
            also had a habit of giving Théophile Belais all sorts of things to take care 
            of—mechanical contrivances, chemicals, bits of old iron, powders, and 
            liquids which gave off noisome smells. <br><br>
            
            Théophile Belais put them cautiously 
            away in the cupboard where he kept his wings, and the responsibility 
            weighed heavily upon him. <br><br>


            Arcade was much pained at the disdain of those of his fellows who had 
            remained faithful. <br><br>
            
            When they met him as they went on their sacred 
            errandsthey regarded him as they passed by with looks of cruel hatred or of 
            pity that was crueller still. <br><br>


            He used to visit the rebel angels whom Prince Istar pointed out to him, and 
            usually met with a good reception, but as soon as he began to speak of 
            conquering Heaven, they did not conceal the embarrassment and 
            displeasure he caused them. <br><br>
            
            Arcade perceived that they had no desire to be 
            disturbed in their tastes, their affairs, and their habits. <br><br>
            
            The falsity of their 
            judgment, the narrowness of their minds, shocked him; and the rivalry, the 
            jealousy they displayed towards one another deprived him of all hope of 
            uniting them in a common cause. <br><br>
            
            Perceiving how exile debases the 
            character and warps the intellect, he felt his courage fail him. <br><br>


            One evening, when he had confessed his weariness of spirit to Zita, the 
            beautiful archangel said: 
            "Let us go and see Nectaire; Nectaire has remedies of his own for sadness 
            and fatigue."<br><br>
            
            
            She led him into the woods of Montmorency and stopped at the threshold of 
            a small white house, adjoining a kitchen garden, laid waste by winter, where 
            far back in the shadows the light shone on forcing-frames and cracked glass 
            melon shades. <br><br>


            Nectaire opened the door to his visitors, and, after quieting the growls of a 
            big mastiff which protected the garden, led them into a low room warmed by 
            an earthenware stove. <br><br>


            Against the whitewashed wall, on a deal board, among the onions and seeds, 
            lay a flute ready to be put to the lips. <br><br>
            
            A round walnut table bore a stone 
            tobacco-jar, a pipe, a bottle of wine and some glasses. <br><br>
            
            The gardener offered 
            each of his guests a cane-seated chair, and himself sat down on a stool by 
            the table. <br><br>


            He was a sturdy old man; thick grey hair stood up on his head, he had a 
            furrowed brow, a snub-nose, a red face, and a forked beard. <br><br>


            The big mastiff stretched himself at his master's feet, rested his short black 
            muzzle on his paws, and closed his eyes. <br><br>
            
            The gardener poured out some 
            wine for his guests, and when they had drunk and talked a little, Zita said 
            to Nectaire: 
            "Please play your flute to us, you will give pleasure to my friend whom I have 
            brought to see you."<br><br>
            
            
            The old man immediately consented. <br><br>
            
            He put the boxwood pipe to his lips,—
            so clumsy was it that it looked as if the gardener had fashioned it himself,—
            and preluded with a few strange runs. <br><br>
            
            Then he developed rich melodies in 
            which the thrills sparkled like diamonds and pearls on a velvet ground. <br><br>


            Touched by cunning fingers, animated with creative breath, the rustic pipe 
            sang like a silver flute. <br><br>
            
            There were no over-shrill notes and the tone was 
            always even and pure. <br><br>
            
            One seemed to be listening to the nightingale and the 
            Muses singing together, the soul of Nature and the soul of Man. <br><br>
            
            And the old 
            man ordered and developed his thoughts in a musical language full of grace 
            and daring. <br><br>
            
            He told of love, of fear, of vain quarrels, of all-conquering 
            laughter, of the calm light of the intellect, of the arrows of the mind piercing 
            with their golden shafts the monsters of Ignorance and Hate. <br><br>
            
            He told also of 
            Joy and Sorrow bending their twin heads over the earth and of Desire which 
            brings worlds into being. <br><br>


            The whole night listened to the flute of Nectaire. <br><br>
            
            Already the evening star 
            was rising above the paling horizon. <br><br>


            There they sat; Zita with hands clasped about her knees, Arcade, his head 
            leaning on his hand, his lips apart. <br><br>
            
            Motionless they listened. <br><br>
            
            A lark, which 
            had awakened hard by in a sandy field, lured by these novel sounds, rose 
            swiftly in the air, hovered a few seconds, then dropped at one swoop into the 
            musician's orchard. <br><br>
            
            The neighbouring sparrows, forsaking the crannies of 
            the mouldering walls, came and sat in a row on the window-ledge whence 
            notes came welling forth that gave them more delight than oats or grains of 
            barley. <br><br>
            
            A jay, coming for the first time out of his wood, folded his sapphire 
            wings on a leafless cherry tree. <br><br>
            
            Beside the drain-head, a large black rat, 
            glistening with the greasy water of the sewers, sitting on his hind legs, 
            raised his short arms and slender fingers in amazement. <br><br>
            
            A field-mouse, that 
            dwelt in the orchard, was seated near him. <br><br>
            
            Down from the tiles came the old 
            tom-cat, who retained the grey fur, the ringed tail, the powerful loins, the 
            courage, and the pride of his ancestors. <br><br>
            
            He pushed against the half-open 
            door with his nose and approaching the flute-player with silent tread, sat 
            gravely down, pricking his ears that had been torn in many a nocturnal 
            combat; the grocer's white cat followed him, sniffing the vibrant air and 
            then, arching her back and closing her blue eyes, listened in ravishment. <br><br>


            Mice, swarming in crowds from under the boards, surrounded them, and 
            fearing neither tooth nor claw, sat motionless, their pink hands folded 
            voluptuously on their bosoms. <br><br>
            
            Spiders that had strayed far from their webs, 
            with waving legs, gathered in a charmed circle on the ceiling. <br><br>
            
            A small grey 
            lizard, that had glided on to the doorstep, stayed there, fascinated, and, in 
            the loft, the bat might have been seen hanging by her nails, head down, now 
            half-awakened from her winter sleep, swaying to the rhythm of the 
            marvellous flute.

        <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN WE SEE YOUNG MAURICE BEWAILING THE LOSS OF HIS 
          GUARDIAN ANGEL, EVEN IN HIS MISTRESS'S ARMS, AND WHEREIN WE 
          HEAR THE ABBÉ PATOUILLE REJECT AS VAIN AND ILLUSORY ALL 
          NOTIONS OF A NEW REBELLION OF THE ANGELS</p>

          <p>
            FORTNIGHT had elapsed since the angel's apparition in the flat. <br><br>
            
            For the 
            first time Gilberte arrived before Maurice at the rendezvous. <br><br>
            
            Maurice was 
            gloomy, Gilberte sulky. <br><br>
            
            So far as they were concerned Nature had resumed 
            her drab monotony. <br><br>
            
            They eyed each other languidly, and kept glancing 
            towards the angle between the wardrobe with the mirror and the window, 
            where recently the pale shade of Arcade had taken shape, and where now 
            the blue cretonne of the hangings was the only thing visible. <br><br>
            
            Without giving 
            him a name (it was unnecessary) Madame des Aubels asked: 
            "You have not seen him since?" 
            Slowly, sadly, Maurice turned his head from right to left, and from left to 
            right. <br><br>
            
            
            "You look as if you missed him," continued Madame des Aubels. <br><br>
            
            "But come, 
            confess that he gave you a terrible fright, and that you were shocked at his 
            unconventionally." <br><br>
            
             
            "Certainly he was unconventional," said Maurice without any resentment. <br><br>
            
            
            "Tell me, Maurice, is it nothing to you now to be with me alone?...
 <br><br>
 
 You need 
            an angel to inspire you.  <br><br>
            
            That is sad, for a young man like you!" 
            Maurice appeared not to hear, and asked gravely: 
            "Gilberte, do you feel that your guardian angel is watching over you?" 
            "I, not at all.  <br><br>
            
            I have never thought of him, and yet I am not without religion.  <br><br>


            In the first place, people who have none are like animals.  <br><br>
            
            And then one 
            cannot go straight without religion.  <br><br>
            
            It is impossible." <br><br>
            
            
            "Exactly, that's just it," said Maurice, his eyes on the violet stripes of his 
            flowerless pyjamas; "when one has one's guardian angel one does not even 
            think about him, and when one has lost him one feels very lonely." <br><br>
            
            
            "So you miss this...." 
            "Well, the fact is...." 
            "Oh, yes, yes, you miss him. <br><br>
            
            Well, my dear, the loss of such a guardian 
            angel as that is no great matter. <br><br>
            
            No, no! he is not worth much, that Arcade 
            of yours. <br><br>
            
            On that famous day, while you were out getting him some clothes, 
            he was ever so long fastening my dress, and I certainly felt his hand....<br><br>
            
            Well, 
            at any rate, don't trust him." 
            Maurice dreamily lit a cigarette. <br><br>
            
            They spoke of the six days' bicycle race at 
            the winter velodrome, and of the aviation show at the motor exhibition at 
            Brussels, without experiencing the slightest amusement. <br><br>
            
            Then they tried 
            love-making as a sort of convenient pastime, and succeeded in becoming 
            moderately absorbed in it; but at the very moment when she might have 
            been expected to play a part more in accordance with a mutual sentiment, 
            she exclaimed with a sudden start: 
            "Good Heavens! Maurice, how stupid of you to tell me that my guardian 
            angel can see me. <br><br>
            
            You cannot imagine how uncomfortable the idea makes 
            me."<br><br>
            
            
            Maurice, somewhat taken aback, recalled, a little roughly, his mistress's 
            wandering thoughts. <br><br>


            She declared that her principles forbade her to think of playing a round 
            game with angels. <br><br>


            Maurice was longing to see Arcade again and had no other thought. <br><br>
            
            He 
            reproached himself for suffering him to depart without discovering where he 
            was going, and he cudgelled his brains night and day thinking how to find 
            him again. <br><br>


            On the bare chance, he put a notice in the personal column of one of the big 
            papers, running thus: 
            "Arcade. <br><br>
            
            Come back to your Maurice."<br><br>
            
            
            Day after day went by, and Arcade did not return. <br><br>


            One morning, at seven o'clock, Maurice went to St.
            
            Sulpice to hear Abbé 
            Patouille say Mass, then, as the priest was leaving the sacristy, he went up 
            to him and asked to be heard for a moment. <br><br>


            They descended the steps of the church together and in the bright morning 
            light walked round the fountain of the Quatre Évêques. <br><br>
            
            In spite of his 
            troubled conscience and the difficulty of presenting so extraordinary a case 
            with any degree of credibility, Maurice related how the angel Arcade had 
            appeared to him and had announced his unhappy resolve to separate from 
            him and to stir up a new revolt of the spirits of glory. <br><br>
            
            And young d'Esparvieu 
            asked the worthy ecclesiastic how to find his celestial guardian again, since 
            he could not bear his absence, and how to lead his angel back to the 
            Christian faith. <br><br>
            
            Abbé Patouille replied in a tone of affectionate sorrow that 
            his dear child had been dreaming, that he took a morbid hallucination for 
            reality, and that it was not permissible to believe that good angels may 
            revolt. <br><br>


            "People have a notion," he added, "that they can lead a life of dissipation and 
            disorder with impunity. <br><br>
            
            They are wrong. <br><br>
            
            The abuse of pleasure corrupts the 
            intelligence and impairs the understanding. <br><br>
            
            The devil takes possession of 
            the sinner's senses, penetrating even to his soul. <br><br>
            
            He has deceived you, 
            Maurice, by a clumsy artifice."<br><br>
            
            
            Maurice objected that he was not in any way a victim of hallucinations, that 
            he had not been dreaming, that he had seen his guardian angel with his 
            eyes and heard him with his ears.<br><br>

            "Monsieur l'Abbé," he insisted, "a lady who happened to be with me at the 
            time,—I need not mention her name,—also saw and heard him.<br><br>
             And, 
            moreover, she felt the angel's fingers straying ... well, anyhow, she felt 
            them.... Believe me, Monsieur l'Abbé, nothing could be more real, more 
            positively certain than this apparition. <br><br>
            
            The angel was fair, young, very 
            handsome. <br><br>
            
            His clear skin seemed, in the shadow, as if bathed in milky light. <br><br>


            He spoke in a pure, sweet voice."<br><br>
            
            
            "That, alone, my child," the Abbé interrupted quickly, "proves you were 
            dreaming. <br><br>
            
            According to all the demonologies, bad angels have a hoarse 
            voice, which grates like a rusty lock, and even if they did contrive to give a 
            certain look of beauty to their faces, they cannot succeed in imitating the 
            pure voice of the good spirits. <br><br>
            
            This fact, attested by numerous witnesses, is 
            established beyond all doubt."<br><br>
            
            
            "But, Monsieur l'Abbé, I saw him. I saw him sit down, stark naked, in an 
            arm-chair on a pair of black stockings. <br><br>
            
            What else do you want me to tell 
            you?" 
            The Abbé Patouille appeared in no way disturbed by this announcement. <br><br>


            "I say once more, my son," he replied, "that these unhappy illusions, these 
            dreams of a deeply troubled soul, are to be ascribed to the deplorable state 
            of your conscience. <br><br>
            
            I believe, moreover, that I can detect the particular 
            circumstance that has caused your unstable mind thus to come to grief. <br><br>


            During the winter in company with Monsieur Sariette and your Uncle 
            Gaétan, you came, in an evil frame of mind, to see the Chapel of the Holy 
            Angels in this church, then undergoing repair. <br><br>
            
            As I observed on that 
            occasion, it is impossible to keep artists too closely to the rules of Christian 
            art; they cannot be too strongly enjoined to respect Holy Writ and its 
            authorized interpreters. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur Eugène Delacroix did not suffer his fiery 
            genius to be controlled by tradition. <br><br>
            
            He brooked no guidance and, here, in 
            this chapel he has painted pictures which in common parlance we call lurid, 
            compositions of a violent, terrible nature which, far from inspiring the soul 
            with peace, quietude, and calm, plunge it into a state of agitation. <br><br>
            
            In them 
            the angels are depicted with wrathful countenances, their features are 
            sombre and uncouth. <br><br>
            
            One might take them to be Lucifer and his 
            companions meditating their revolt. <br><br>
            
            Well, my son, it was these pictures, 
            acting upon a mind already weakened and undermined by every kind of 
            dissipation, that have filled it with the trouble to which it is at present a 
            prey."<br><br>
            
            
            But Maurice would have none of it. <br><br>


            "Oh, no! Monsieur l'Abbé," he cried, "it is not Eugène Delacroix's pictures 
            that have been troubling me. <br><br>
            
            I didn't so much as look at them. <br><br>
            
            I am 
            completely indifferent to that kind of art."<br><br>
            
            
            "Well, then, my son, believe me: there is no truth, no reality, in any of the 
            story you have just related to me. <br><br>
            
            Your guardian angel has certainly not 
            appeared to you."<br><br>
            
            
            "But, Abbé," replied Maurice, who had the most absolute confidence in the 
            evidence of the senses, "I saw him tying up a woman's shoe-laces and 
            putting on the trousers of a suicide." <br><br>

            And stamping his feet on the asphalt, Maurice called as witnesses to the 
            truth of his words the sky, the earth, all nature, the towers of St. Sulpice, 
            the walls of the great seminary, the Fountain of the Quatre Évêques, the 
            public lavatory, the cabmen's shelter, the taxis and motor 'buses' shelter, 
            the trees, the passers-by, the dogs, the sparrows, the flower-seller and her 
            flowers. <br><br>


            The Abbé made haste to end the interview. <br><br>


            "All this is error, falsehood, and illusion, my child," said he. <br><br>
            
            "You are a 
            Christian: think as a Christian,—a Christian does not allow himself to be 
            seduced by empty shadows. <br><br>
            
            Faith protects him against the seduction of the 
            marvellous, he leaves credulity to freethinkers. <br><br>
            
            There are credulous people 
            for you—freethinkers! There is no humbug they will not swallow. <br><br>
            
            But the 
            Christian carries a weapon which dissipates diabolical illusions,—the sign of 
            the Cross. <br><br>
            
            Reassure yourself, Maurice,—you have not lost your guardian 
            angel. <br><br>
            
            He still watches over you. <br><br>
            
            It lies with you not to make this task too 
            difficult nor too painful for him. <br><br>
            
            Good-bye, Maurice. <br><br>
            
            The weather is going to 
            change, for I feel a burning in my big toe."<br><br>
            
            
            And Abbé Patouille went off with his breviary under his arm, hobbling along 
            with a dignity that seemed to foretell a mitre. <br><br>


            That very day, Arcade and Zita were leaning over the parapet of La Butte, 
            gazing down on the mist and smoke that lay floating over the vast city. <br><br>


            "Is it possible," said Arcade, "for the mind to conceive all the pain and 
            suffering that lie pent within a great city? It is my belief that if a man 
            succeeded in realising it, the weight of it would crush him to the earth."<br><br>
            
            
            "And yet," answered Zita, "every living being in that place of torment is 
            enamoured of life. <br><br>
            
            It is a great enigma! 
            "Unhappy, ill-fated, while they live, the idea of ceasing to be is, nevertheless, 
            a horror to them. <br><br>
            
            They look not for solace in annihilation, it does not even 
            bring them the promise of rest. <br><br>
            
            In their madness they even look upon 
            nothingness with terror: they have peopled it with phantoms. <br><br>
            
            Look you at 
            these pediments, these towers and domes and spires that pierce the mist 
            and rear on high their glittering crosses. <br><br>
            
            Men bow in adoration before the 
            demiurge who has given them a life that is worse than death, and a death 
            that is worse than life."<br><br>
            
            
            Zita was for a long time lost in thought. <br><br>
            
            At length she broke silence, saying: 
            "There is something, Arcade, that I must confess to you. <br><br>
            
            It was no desire for 
            a purer justice or wiser laws that hurried Ithuriel earthward. <br><br>
            
            Ambition, a 
            taste for intrigue, the love of wealth and honour, all these things made 
            Heaven, with its calm, unbearable to me, and I longed to mingle with the 
            restless race of men. <br><br>
            
            I came, and by an art unknown to nearly all the angels, 
            I learned how to fashion myself a body which, since I could change it as the 
            fancy seized me, to whatsoever age and sex I would, has permitted me to 
            experience the most diverse and amazing of human destinies. <br><br>
            
            A hundred 
            times I took a position of renown among the leaders of the day, the lords of 
            wealth and princes of nations. <br><br>
            
            I will not reveal to you, Arcade, the famous 
            names I bore; know only that I was pre-eminent in learning, in the fine arts, 
            in power, wealth, and beauty, among all the nations of the world. <br><br>
            
            At last, it 
            was but a few years since, as I was journeying in France, under the outward 
            semblance of a distinguished foreigner, I chanced to be roaming at evening 
            through the forest of Montmorency, when I heard a flute unfolding all the 
            sorrows of Heaven. <br><br>
            
            The purity and sadness of its notes rent my very soul. <br><br>


            Never before had I hearkened to aught so lovely. <br><br>
            
            My eyes were wet with 
            tears, my bosom full of sobs, as I drew near and beheld, on the skirts of a 
            glade, an old man like to a faun, blowing on a rustic pipe. <br><br>
            
            It was Nectaire. <br><br>
            
            I 
            cast myself at his feet, imprinted kisses on his hands and on his lips divine, 
            and fled away.... <br><br>

            "From that day forth, conscious of the littleness of human achievements, 
            weary of the tumult and the vanity of earthly things, ashamed of my vast 
            and profitless endeavours, and deciding to seek out a loftier aim for my 
            ambition, I looked upwards towards my skiey home and vowed I would 
            return to it as a Deliverer. <br><br>
            
            I rid myself of titles, name, wealth, friends, the 
            horde of sycophants and flatterers and, as Zita the obscure, set to work in 
            indigence and solitude, to bring freedom into Heaven."<br><br>
            
            
            "And I," said Arcade, "I too have heard the flute of Nectaire. <br><br>
            
            But who is this 
            old gardener who can thus woo from a rude wooden pipe notes that are so 
            moving and so beautiful?" 
            "You will soon know," answered Zita. <br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN MIRA THE SEERESS, ZÉPHYRINE, AND THE FATAL AMÉDÉE 
          ARE SUCCESSIVELY BROUGHT UPON THE SCENE, AND WHEREIN THE 
          NOTION OF EURIPIDES THAT THOSE WHOM ZEUS WISHES TO CRUSH 
          HE FIRST MAKES MAD, IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE TERRIBLE EXAMPLE 
          OF MONSIEUR SARIETTE </p>

          <p>
            ISAPPOINTED at his failure to enlighten an ecclesiastic renowned for his 
            clarity of mind, and frustrated in the hope of finding his angel again on the 
            high road of orthodoxy, Maurice took it into his head to resort to occultism 
            and resolved to go and consult a seer. <br><br>
            
            He would have undoubtedly applied 
            to Madame de Thèbes, but he had already questioned her on the occasion of 
            his early love troubles, and her replies showed such wisdom that he no 
            longer believed her to be a soothsayer. <br><br>
            
            He therefore had recourse to a 
            fashionable medium, Madame Mira. <br><br>
            
            He had heard many examples quoted of 
            the extraordinary insight of this seeress, but it was necessary to present 
            Madame Mira with some object which the absent one had either touched or 
            worn and to which her translucent gaze had to be attracted. <br><br>
            
            Maurice, trying 
            to remember what the angel had touched since his ill-fated incarnation, 
            recollected that in his celestial nudity he had sat down in an arm-chair on 
            Madame des Aubels' black stockings and that he had afterwards helped that 
            lady to dress. <br><br>


            Maurice asked Gilberte for one of the talismans required by the clairvoyante. <br><br>


            But Gilberte could not give him a single one, unless, as she said, she herself 
            were to play the part of the talisman. <br><br>
            
            For the angel had, in her case, 
            displayed the greatest indiscretion, and such agility that it was impossible 
            always to forestall his enterprise. <br><br>
            
            On hearing this confession, which 
            nevertheless told him nothing new, Maurice lost his temper with the angel, 
            calling him by the names of the lowest animals and swearing he would give 
            him a good kick when he got him within reach of his foot. <br><br>
            
            But his fury soon 
            turned against Madame des Aubels; he accused her of having provoked the 
            insolence she now denounced, and in his wrath he referred to her by all the 
            zoological symbols of immodesty and perversity. <br><br>
            
            His love for Arcade was 
            rekindled in his heart, and burned with a more ardent flame than ever, and 
            the deserted youth, with outstretched arms and bended knees, invoked his 
            angel with sobs and lamentations. <br><br>


            During his sleepless nights it occurred to him that perhaps the books the 
            angel had turned over before his incarnation might serve as a talisman. <br><br>
            
            One 
            morning, therefore, Maurice went up to the library and greeted Monsieur 
            Sariette, who was cataloguing under the romantic gaze of Alexandre 
            d'Esparvieu. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur Sariette smiled, but his face was deathly pale. <br><br>
            
            Now 
            that an invisible hand no longer upset the books placed under his charge, 
            now that tranquillity and order once more reigned in the library, Monsieur 
            Sariette was happy, but his strength diminished day by day. <br><br>
            
            There was little 
            left of him but a frail and contented shadow. <br><br>


            "One dies, in full content, of sorrow past."<br><br>
            
            
            "Monsieur Sariette," said Maurice, "you remember that time when your 
            books were disarranged every night, how armfuls disappeared, how they 
            were dragged about, turned over, ruined, and sent rolling helter-skelter as 
            far as the gutter in the Rue Palatine. <br><br>
            
            Those were great days! Point out to me, 
            Monsieur Sariette, the books which suffered most."<br><br>
            
            
            This proposition threw Monsieur Sariette into a melancholy stupor, and 
            Maurice had to repeat his request three times before he could make the aged 
            librarian understand. <br><br>
            
            At length he pointed to a very ancient Talmud from 
            Jerusalem as having been frequently touched by those unseen hands. <br><br>
            
            An 
            apocryphal Gospel of the third century, consisting of twenty papyrus sheets, 
            had also quitted its place time after time. <br><br>
            
            Gassendi's Correspondence too 
            seemed to have been well thumbed. <br><br>


            "But," added Monsieur Sariette, "the book to which the mysterious visitant 
            devoted the most particular attention was undoubtedly a little copy 
            ofLucretius adorned with the arms of Philippe de Vendôme, Grand Prieur de 
            France, with autograph annotations by Voltaire, who, as is well known, 
            frequently visited the Temple in his younger days. <br><br>
            
            The fearsome reader who 
            caused me such terrible anxiety never grew weary of this Lucretius and 
            made it his bedside book, as it were. <br><br>
            
            His taste was sound, for it's a gem of a 
            thing. <br><br>
            
            Alas! the monster made a blot of ink on page 137 which perhaps the 
            chemists with all the science at their disposal will be powerless to erase."<br><br>
            
            
            And Monsieur Sariette heaved a profound sigh. <br><br>
            
            He repented having said all 
            this 
            when young d'Esparvieu asked him for the loan of the 
            preciousLucretius. <br><br>
            
            Vainly did the jealous custodian affirm that the book was 
            being repaired at the binder's and was not available. <br><br>
            
            Maurice made it clear 
            that he wasn't to be taken in like that. <br><br>
            
            He strode resolutely into the abode of 
            the philosophers and the globes and seating himself in an arm-chair said: 
            "I am waiting."<br><br>
            
            
            Monsieur Sariette suggested his having another edition. <br><br>
            
            There were some 
            that, textually, were more correct, and were, therefore, preferable from the 
            student's point of view. <br><br>
            
            He offered him Barbou's edition, or Coustelier's, or, 
            better still, a French translation. <br><br>
            
            He could have the Baron des Coutures' 
            version—which was perhaps a little old-fashioned—or La Grange's, or those 
            in the Nisard and Panckouke series; or, again, there were two versions of 
            striking elegance, one in verse and the other in prose, both from the pen of 
            Monsieur de Pongerville of the French Academy. <br><br>


            "I don't need a translation," said Maurice proudly. <br><br>
            
            "Give me the Prior de 
            Vendôme's copy."<br><br>
            
            
            Monsieur Sariette went slowly up to the cupboard in which the jewel in 
            question was contained. <br><br>
            
            The keys were rattling in his trembling hand. <br><br>
            
            He 
            raised them to the lock and withdrew them again immediately and 
            suggested that Maurice should have the common Lucretius published by 
            Garnier. <br><br>


            "It's very handy," said he with an engaging smile. <br><br>


            But the silence with which this proposal was received made it clear that 
            resistance was useless. <br><br>
            
            He slowly drew forth the volume from its place, and 
            having taken the precaution to see that there wasn't a speck of dust on the 
            table-cloth, he laid it tremblingly thereon before the great-grandson of 
            Alexandre d'Esparvieu. <br><br>


            Maurice began to turn the leaves, and when he got to page 137 he saw the 
            stain which had been made with violet ink. <br><br>
            
            It was about the size of a pea. <br><br>


            "Ay, that's it," said old Sariette, who had his eye on the Lucretius the whole 
            time; "that's the trace those invisible monsters left behind them."<br><br>
            
            
            "What, there were several of them, Monsieur Sariette?" exclaimed Maurice. <br><br>


            "I cannot tell. <br><br>
            
            But I don't know whether I have a right to have this blot 
            removed since, like the blot Paul Louis Courier made on the Florentine 
            manuscript, it constitutes a literary document, so to speak."<br><br>
            
            
            Scarcely were the words out of the old fellow's mouth when the front door 
            bell rang and there was a confused noise of voices and footsteps in the next 
            room. <br><br>
            
            Sariette ran forward at the sound and collided with Père Guinardon's 
            mistress, old Zéphyrine, who, with her tousled hair sticking up like a nest of 
            vipers, her face aflame, her bosom heaving, her abdominal part like an 
            eiderdown quilt puffed out by a terrific gale, was choking with grief and rage. <br><br>


            And amid sobs and sighs and groans and all the innumerable sounds 
            which, on earth, make up the mighty uproar to which the emotions of living 
            beings and the tumult of nature give rise, she cried: 
            "He's gone, the monster! He's gone off with her. <br><br>
            
            He's cleared out the whole 
            shanty and left me to shift for myself with eighteenpence in my purse."<br><br>
            
            
            And she proceeded to give a long and incoherent account of how Michel 
            Guinardon had abandoned her and gone to live with Octavie, the bread
            woman's daughter, and she let loose a torrent of abuse against the traitor. <br><br>


            "A man whom I've kept going with my own money for fifty years and more. <br><br>


            For I've had plenty of the needful and known plenty of the upper ten and all. <br><br>


            I dragged him out of the gutter and now this is what I get for it. <br><br>
            
            He's a bright 
            beauty, that friend of yours. <br><br>
            
            The lazy scoundrel. <br><br>
            
            Why, he had to be dressed 
            like a child, the drunken contemptible brute. <br><br>
            
            You don't know him yet, 
            Monsieur Sariette. <br><br>
            
            He's a forger. <br><br>
            
            He turns out Giottos, Giottos, I tell you, 
            and Fra Angelicos and Grecos, as hard as he can and sells them to art
            dealers—yes, and Fragonards too, and Baudouins. <br><br>
            
            He's a debauchee, and 
            doesn't believe in God! That's the worst of the lot, Monsieur Sariette, for 
            without the fear of God...."<br><br>
            
             
            Long did Zéphyrine continue to pour forth vituperations. <br><br>
            
            When at last her 
            breath failed her, Monsieur Sariette availed himself of the opportunity to 
            exhort her to be calm and bring herself to look on the bright side of things. <br><br>
            
            
            Guinardon would come back. <br><br>
            
            A man doesn't forget anyone he's lived and got 
            on well with for fifty years—— 
            These two observations only goaded her to a fresh outburst, and Zéphyrine 
            swore she would never forget the slight that had been put on her; she swore 
            she would never have the monster back with her any more. <br><br>
            
            And if he came 
            to ask her to forgive him on his knees, she would let him grovel at her feet. <br><br>
            
            
            "Don't you understand, Monsieur Sariette, that I despise and hate him, that 
            he makes me sick?" 
            Sixty times she voiced these lofty sentiments; sixty times she vowed she 
            would never have Guinardon back with her again, that she couldn't bear the 
            sight of him, even in a picture. <br><br>
            
            
            Monsieur Sariette made no attempt to oppose a resolve which, after 
            protestations such as these, he regarded as unshakable. <br><br>
            
            He did not blame 
            Zéphyrine in the least. <br><br>
            
            He even supported her. <br><br>
            
             Unfolding to the deserted one 
            a purer future, he told her of the frailty of human sentiment, exhorted her to 
            display a spirit of renunciation and enjoined her to show a pious resignation 
            to the will of God. <br><br>
            
            
            "Seeing, in truth, that your friend is so little worthy of affection ..." <br><br>

            He was not suffered to continue. <br><br>
            
            Zéphyrine flew at him, and shaking him 
            furiously by the collar of his frock-coat, she yelled, half choking with rage: 
            "So little worthy of affection! Michel! Ah! my boy, you find another more 
            kind, more gay, more witty, you find another like him, always young, yes, 
            always. <br><br>
            
            Not worthy of affection! Anyone can see you don't know anything 
            about love, you old duffer."<br><br>
            
            
            Taking advantage of the fact that Père Sariette was thus deeply engaged, 
            young d'Esparvieu slipped the little Lucretius into his pocket, and strolled 
            deliberately past the crouching librarian, bidding him adieu with a little 
            wave of the hand. <br><br>

            
            Armed with his talisman, he hastened to the Place des Ternes, to interview 
            Madame Mira. <br><br>
            
            She received him in a red drawing-room where neither owl 
            nor frog nor any of the paraphernalia of ancient magic were to be found. <br><br>

            
            Madame Mira, in a prune-coloured dress, her hair powdered, though already 
            past her prime, was of very good appearance. <br><br>
            
            She spoke with a certain 
            elegance and prided herself on discovering hidden things by the help alone 
            of Science, Philosophy, and Religion. <br><br>
            
            She felt the morocco binding, feigning 
            to close her eyes, and looking meanwhile through the narrow slit between 
            her lids at the Latin title and the coat of arms which conveyed nothing to 
            her. <br><br>

            
            Accustomed to receive as tokens such things as rings, handkerchiefs, 
            letters, and locks of hair, she could not conceive to what sort of individual 
            this singular book could belong. <br><br>
            
            By habitual and mechanical cunning she 
            disguised her real surprise under a feigned surprise. <br><br>

            
            "Strange!" she murmured, "strange! I do not see quite clearly ...<br><br>
            
             I perceive a 
            woman...." 
            As she let fall this magic word, she glanced furtively to see what sort of an 
            effect it had and beheld on her questioner's face an unexpected look of 
            disappointment. <br><br>
            
            Perceiving that she was off the track, she immediately 
            changed her oracle: 
            "But she fades away immediately. <br><br>
            
            It is strange, strange! I have a confused 
            impression of some vague form, a being that I cannot define," and having 
            assured herself by a hurried glance that, this time, her words were going 
            down, she expatiated on the vagueness of the person and on the mist that 
            enveloped him. <br><br>
            
            
            However, the vision grew clearer to Madame Mira, who was following a clue 
            step by step. <br><br>
            
            
            "A wide street ... a square with a statue ... a deserted street,—stairs. He is 
            there in a bluish room—he is a young man, with pale and careworn face. <br><br>


            There are things he seems to regret, and which he would not do again did 
            they still remain undone."<br><br>
            
            
            But the effort at divination had been too great. <br><br>
            
            Fatigue prevented the 
            clairvoyante from continuing her transcendental researches. <br><br>
            
            She spent her 
            remaining strength in impressively recommending him who consulted her to 
            remain in intimate union with God if he wished to regain what he had lost 
            and succeed in his attempts. <br><br>


            On leaving Maurice placed a louis on the mantelpiece and went away moved 
            and troubled, persuaded that Madame Mira possessed supernatural 
            faculties, but unfortunately insufficient ones. <br><br>


            At the bottom of the stairs he remembered he had left the little Lucretius on 
            the table of the pythoness, and, thinking that the old maniac Sariette would 
            never get over its loss, went up to recover possession of it. <br><br>


            On re-entering the paternal abode his gaze lighted upon a shadowy and 
            grief-stricken figure. <br><br>
            
            It was old Sariette, who in tones as plaintive as the wail 
            of the November wind began to beg for his Lucretius. <br><br>
            
            Maurice pulled it 
            carelessly out of his great-coat pocket. <br><br>


            "Don't flurry yourself, Monsieur Sariette," said he. <br><br>
            
            "There the thing is."<br><br>
            
            
            Clasping the jewel to his bosom the old librarian bore it away and laid it 
            gently down on the blue table-cloth, thinking all the while where he might 
            safely hide his precious treasure, and turning over all sorts of schemes in 
            his mind as became a zealous curator. <br><br>
            
            But who among us shall boast of his 
            wisdom? The foresight of man is short, and his prudence is for ever being 
            baffled. <br><br>
            
            The blows of fate are ineluctable; no man shall evade his doom. <br><br>


            There is no counsel, no caution that avails against destiny. <br><br>
            
            Hapless as we 
            are, the same blind force which regulates the courses of atom and of star 
            fashions universal order from our vicissitudes. <br><br>
            
            Our ill-fortune is necessary 
            to the harmony of the Universe. <br><br>
            
            It was the day for the binder, a day which 
            the revolving seasons brought round twice a year, beneath the sign of the 
            Ram and the sign of the Scales. <br><br>
            
            That day, ever since morning, Monsieur 
            Sariette had been making things ready for the binder. <br><br>
            
            He had laid out on the 
            table as many of the newly purchased paper-bound volumes as were deemed 
            worthy of a permanent binding or of being put in boards, and also those 
            books whose binding was in need of repair, and of all these he had drawn 
            up a detailed and accurate list. <br><br>
            
            Punctually at five o'clock, old Amédée, the 
            man from Léger-Massieu's, the binder in the Rue de l'Abbaye, presented 
            himself at the d'Esparvieu library and, after a double check had been 
            carried out by Monsieur Sariette, thrust the books he was to take back to 
            his master into a piece of cloth which he fastened into knots at the four 
            corners and hoisted on to his shoulder. <br><br>
            
            He then saluted the librarian with 
            the following words, "Good night, all!" and went downstairs. <br><br>


            Everything went off on this occasion as usual. <br><br>
            
            But Amédée, seeing the 
            Lucretius on the table, innocently put it into the bag with the others, and 
            took it away without Monsieur Sariette's perceiving it. <br><br>
            
            The librarian quitted 
            the home of the Philosophers and Globes in entire forgetfulness of the book 
            whose absence had been causing him such horrible anxiety all day long. <br><br>


            Some people may take a stern view of the matter and call this a lapse, a 
            defection of his better nature. <br><br>
            
            But would it not be more accurate to say that 
            fate had decided that things should come to pass in this manner, and that 
            what is called chance, and is in fact but the regular order of nature, had 
            accomplished this imperceptible deed which was to have such awful 
            consequences in the sight of man? Monsieur Sariette went off to his dinner 
            at the Quatre Évêques, and read his paper La Croix. <br><br>
            
            He was tranquil and 
            serene. <br><br>
            
            It was only the next morning when he entered the abode of the 
            Philosophers and Globes that he remembered the Lucretius. <br><br>
            
            Failing to see it 
            on the table he looked for it everywhere, but without success. <br><br>
            
            It never 
            entered his head that Amédée might have taken it away by mistake. <br><br>
            
            What he 
            did think was that the invisible visitant had returned, and he was mightily 
            disturbed. <br><br>


            The unhappy curator, hearing a noise on the landing, opened the door and 
            found it was little Léon, who, with a gold-braided képi stuck on his head, 
            was shouting "Vive la France" and hurling dusters and feather-brooms and 
            Hippolyte's floor polish at imaginary foes. <br><br>
            
            The child preferred this landing for 
            playing soldiers to any other part of the house, and sometimes he would 
            stray into the library. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur Sariette was seized with the sudden 
            suspicion that it was he who had taken the Lucretius to use as a missile 
            and he ordered him, in threatening tones, to give it back. <br><br>
            
            The child denied 
            that he had taken it, and Monsieur Sariette had recourse to cajolery. <br><br>


            "Léon, if you bring me back the little red book, I will give you some 
            chocolates."<br><br>
            
            
            The child grew thoughtful; and in the evening, as Monsieur Sariette was 
            going downstairs, he met Léon, who said: 
            "There's the book!" 
            And, holding out a much-torn picture-book called The Story of Gribouille, 
            demanded his chocolates. <br><br>


            A few days later the post brought Maurice the prospectus of an enquiry 
            agency managed by an ex-employee at the Prefecture of Police; it promised 
            celerity and discretion. <br><br>
            
            He found at the address indicated a moustached 
            gentleman morose and careworn, who demanded a deposit and promised to 
            find the individual. <br><br>


            The ex-police official soon wrote to inform him that very onerous 
            investigations had been commenced and asked for fresh funds. <br><br>
            
            Maurice 
            gave him no more and resolved to carry on the search himself. <br><br>
            
            Imagining, 
            not without some likelihood, that the angel would associate with the 
            wretched, seeing that he had no money, and with the exiled of all nations—
            like himself, revolutionaries—he visited the lodging-houses at St. <br><br>
            
            Ouen, at la 
            Chapelle, Montmartre, and the Barrière d'Italie. <br><br>
            
            He sought him in the doss
            houses, public-houses where they give you plates of tripe, and others where 
            you can get a sausage for three sous; he searched for him in the cellars at 
            the Market and at Père Momie's. <br><br>


            Maurice visited the restaurants where nihilists and anarchists take their 
            meals. <br><br>
            
            There he came across men dressed as women, gloomy and wild
            looking youths, and blue-eyed octogenarians who laughed like little 
            children. <br><br>
            
            He observed, asked questions, was taken for a spy, had a knife 
            thrust into him by a very beautiful woman, and the very next day continued 
            his search in beer-houses, lodging-houses, houses of ill-fame, gambling
            hells down by the fortifications, at the receivers of stolen goods, and among 
            the "apaches."<br><br>
            
            
            Seeing him thus pale, harassed, and silent, his mother grew worried. <br><br>


            "We must find him a wife," she said. <br><br>
            
            "It is a pity that Mademoiselle de la 
            Verdelière has not a bigger fortune."<br><br>
            
            
            Abbé Patouille did not hide his anxiety. <br><br>


            "This child," he said, "is passing through a moral crisis."<br><br>
            
            
            "I am more inclined to think," replied Monsieur René d'Esparvieu, "that he is 
            under the influence of some bad woman. <br><br>
            
            We must find him an occupation 
            which will absorb him and flatter his vanity. <br><br>
            
            I might get him appointed 
            Secretary to the Committee for the Preservation of Country Churches, or 
            Consulting Counsel to the Syndicate of Catholic Plumbers."<br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN WE LEARN THAT SOPHAR, NO LESS EAGER FOR GOLD 
          THAN MAMMON, LOOKED UPON HIS HEAVENLY HOME LESS 
          FAVOURABLY THAN UPON FRANCE, A COUNTRY BLESSED WITH A 
          SAVINGS BANK AND LOAN DEPARTMENTS, AND WHEREIN WE SEE, 
          YET ONCE AGAIN, THAT WHOSO IS POSSESSED OF THIS WORLD'S 
          GOODS FEARS THE EVIL EFFECTS OF ANY CHANGE </p>

          <p>
            EANWHILE Arcade led a life of obscure toil. He worked at a printer's in the 
            Rue St. Benoît, and lived in an attic in the Rue Mouffetard. His comrades 
            having gone on strike, he left the workroom and devoted his day to his 
            propaganda. <br><br>
            
            So successful was he that he won over to the side of revolt fifty 
            thousand of those guardian angels who, as Zita had surmised, were 
            discontented with their condition and imbued with the spirit of the times. <br><br>


            But lacking money, he lacked liberty, and could not employ his time as he 
            wished in instructing the sons of Heaven. <br><br>
            
            So, too, Prince Istar, hampered by 
            want of funds, manufactured fewer bombs than were needed, and these less 
            fine. <br><br>
            
            Of course he prepared a good many small pocket machines. <br><br>
            
            He had 
            filled Théophile's rooms with them, and not a day passed but he forgot some 
            and left them lying about on the seats in various cafés. <br><br>
            
            But a nice bomb, 
            easily handled and capable of destroying many big mansions, cost him from 
            twenty to twenty-five thousand francs; and Prince Istar only possessed two 
            of this kind. <br><br>
            
            Equally bent on procuring funds, Arcade and Istar both went to 
            make a request for money from a celebrated financier named Max 
            Everdingen, who, as everyone knows, is the managing director of the biggest 
            banking concern in France and indeed in the whole world. <br><br>
            
            What is not so 
            well known is that Max Everdingen was not born of woman, but is a fallen 
            angel. <br><br>
            
            Nevertheless, such is the truth. <br><br>
            
            In Heaven he was named Sophar, and 
            guarded the treasures of Ialdabaoth, a great collector of gold and precious 
            stones. <br><br>
            
            In the exercise of this function Sophar contracted a love of riches 
            which could not be satisfied in a state of society in which banks and stock 
            exchanges are alike unknown. <br><br>
            
            His heart flamed with an ardent love for the 
            god of the Hebrews to whom he remained faithful during a long course of 
            centuries. <br><br>
            
            But at the commencement of the twentieth century of the 
            Christian era, casting his eyes down from the height of the firmament upon 
            France, he saw that this country, under the name of a Republic, was 
            constituted as a plutocracy and that, under the appearance of a democratic 
            government, high finance exercised sovereign sway, untrammelled and 
            unchecked. <br><br>


            Henceforth life in the Empyrean became intolerable to him. <br><br>
            
            He longed for 
            France as for the promised land, and one day, bearing with him all the 
            precious stones he could carry, he descended to earth and established 
            himself in Paris. <br><br>
            
            This angel of cupidity did good business there. <br><br>
            
            Since his 
            materialisation his face had lost its celestial aspect; it reproduced the 
            Semitic type in all its purity, and one could admire the lines and the 
            puckers which wrinkle the faces of bankers and which are to be seen in the 
            money-changers of Quintin Matsys. <br><br>


            His beginnings were humble and his success amazing. <br><br>
            
            He married an ugly 
            woman and they saw themselves reflected in their children as in a mirror. <br><br>


            Baron Max Everdingen's large mansion, which rears itself on the heights of 
            the Trocadéro, is crammed with the spoils of Christian Europe. <br><br>


            The Baron received Arcade and Prince Istar in his study,—one of the most 
            modest rooms in his mansion. <br><br>
            
            The ceiling is decorated with a fresco of 
            Tiepolo, taken from a Venetian palace. <br><br>
            
            The bureau of the Regent, Philip of 
            Orleans, is in this room, which is full of cabinets, show-cases, pictures, and 
            statues. <br><br>


            Arcade allowed his gaze to wander over the walls. <br><br>


            "How comes it, my brother Sophar," said he, "that you, in spite of your 
            Jewish heart, obey so ill the commandment of the Lord your God who said: 
            'Thou shalt have no graven images'? for here I see an Apollo of Houdon's and 
            a Hebe of Lemoine's, and several busts by Caffieri. <br><br>
            
            And, like Solomon in his 
            old age, O son of God, you set up in your dwelling-place the idols of strange 
            nations: for such are this Venus of Boucher, this Jupiter of Rubens, and 
            those nymphs that are indebted to Fragonard's brush for the gooseberry jam 
            which smears their gleaming limbs. <br><br>
            
            And here in this single show-case, 
            Sophar, you keep the sceptre of St. 
            Louis, six hundred pearls of Marie 
            Antoinette's broken necklace, the imperial mantle of Charles V, the tiara 
            wrought by Ghiberti for Pope Martin V, the Colonna, Bonaparte's sword—
            and I know not what besides."<br><br>
            
            
            "Mere trifles," said Max Everdingen. 
            "My dear Baron," said Prince Istar, "you even possess the ring which 
            Charlemagne placed on a fairy's finger and which was thought to be lost. <br><br>


            But let us discuss the business on which we have come. <br><br>
            
            My friend and I 
            have come to ask you for money."<br><br>
            
            
            "I can well believe it," replied Max Everdingen. <br><br>
            
            "Everyone wants money, but 
            for different reasons. <br><br>
            
            What do you want money for?" 
            Prince Istar replied simply: 
            "To stir up a revolution in France."<br><br>
            
            
            "In France!" repeated the Baron, "in France? Well, I shall give you no money 
            for that, you may be quite sure."<br><br>
            
            
            Arcade did not disguise the fact that he had expected greater liberality and 
            more generous help from a celestial brother. <br><br>


            "Our project," he said, "is a vast one. <br><br>
            
            It embraces both Heaven and Earth. <br><br>
            
            It 
            is settled in every detail. <br><br>
            
            We shall first bring about a social revolution in 
            France, in Europe, on the whole planet; then we shall carry war into the 
            heavens, where we shall establish a peaceful democracy. <br><br>
            
            And to reduce the 
            citadels of Heaven, to overturn the mountain of God, to storm celestial 
            Jerusalem, a vast army is needful, enormous resources, formidable 
            machines, and electrophores of a strength yet unknown. <br><br>
            
            It is our intention 
            to commence with France."<br><br>
            
            
            "You are madmen!" exclaimed Baron Everdingen; "madmen and fools! Listen 
            to me. <br><br>
            
            There is not one single reform to carry out in France. <br><br>
            
            All is perfect, 
            finally settled, unchangeable. <br><br>
            
            You hear?—unchangeable."<br><br>
            
            And to add force 
            to his statement, Baron Everdingen banged his fist three times on the 
            Regent's bureau. <br><br>


            "Our points of view differ," said Arcade sweetly. <br><br>
            
            "I think, as does Prince Istar, 
            that everything should be changed in this country. <br><br>
            
            But what boots it to 
            dispute the matter? Moreover, it is too late. <br><br>
            
            We have come to speak to you, 
            O my brother Sophar, in the name of five hundred thousand celestial spirits, 
            all resolved to commence the universal revolution to-morrow."<br><br>
            
            
            Baron Everdingen exclaimed that they were crazy, that he would not give a 
            sou, that it was both criminal and mad to attack the most admirable thing 
            in the world, the thing which renders earth more beautiful than heaven—
            Finance. <br><br>
            
            He was a poet and a prophet. <br><br>
            
            His heart thrilled with holy 
            enthusiasm; he drew attention to the French Savings Bank, the virtuous 
            Savings Bank, that chaste and pure Savings Bank like unto the Virgin of the 
            Canticle who, issuing from the depths of the country in rustic petticoat, 
            bears to the robust and splendid Bank—her bridegroom, who awaits her—
            the treasures of her love; and drew a picture of the Bank, enriched with the 
            gifts of its spouse, pouring on all the nations of the world torrents of gold, 
            which, of themselves, by a thousand invisible channels return in still greater 
            abundance to the blessed land from which they sprung. <br><br>


            "By Deposit and Loan," he went on, "France has become the New Jerusalem, 
            shedding her glory over all the nations of Europe, and the Kings of the Earth 
            come to kiss her rosy feet. <br><br>
            
            And that is what you would fain destroy? You are 
            both impious and sacrilegious."<br><br>
            
            
            Thus spoke the angel of finance. <br><br>
            
            An invisible harp accompanied his voice, 
            and his eyes darted lightning. <br><br>


            Meanwhile Arcade, leaning carelessly against the Regent's bureau, spread 
            out under the Banker's eyes various ground-plans, underground-plans, and 
            sky-plans of Paris with red crosses indicating the points where bombs 
            should be simultaneously placed in cellars and catacombs, thrown on public 
            ways, and flung by a flotilla of aeroplanes. <br><br>
            
            All the financial establishments, 
            and notably the Everdingen Bank and its branches, were marked with red 
            crosses. <br><br>


            The financier shrugged his shoulders. <br><br>


            "Nonsense! you are but wretches and vagabonds, shadowed by all the police 
            of the world. <br><br>
            
            You are penniless. <br><br>
            
            How can you manufacture all the 
            machines?" 
            By way of reply, Prince Istar drew from his pocket a small copper cylinder, 
            which he gracefully presented to Baron Everdingen. <br><br>


            "You see," said he, "this ordinary-looking box. <br><br>
            
            It is only necessary to let it 
            fall on the ground immediately to reduce this mansion with its inmates to a 
            mass of smoking ashes, and to set a fire going which would devour all the 
            Trocadéro quarter. <br><br>
            
            I have ten thousand like that, and I make three dozen a 
            day."<br><br>
            
            
            The financier asked the Cherub to replace the machine in his pocket, and 
            continued in a conciliatory tone: 
            "Listen to me, my friends. <br><br>
            
            Go and start a revolution at once in Heaven, and 
            leave things alone in this country. <br><br>
            
            I will sign a cheque for you. <br><br>
            
            You can 
            procure all the material you need to attack celestial Jerusalem."<br><br>
            
            
            And Baron Everdingen was already working up in his imagination a 
            magnificent deal in electrophores and war-material. <br><br>



          </p>




        <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN IS BEGUN THE GARDENER'S STORY, IN THE COURSE OF 
          WHICH WE SHALL SEE THE DESTINY OF THE WORLD UNFOLDED IN A 
          DISCOURSE AS BROAD AND MAGNIFICENT IN ITS VIEWS AS 
          BOSSUET'S DISCOURSE ON THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE IS 
          NARROW AND DISMAL </p>

          <p>
            HE gardener bade Arcade and Zita sit down in an arbour walled with wild 
            bryony, at the far end of the orchard.  <br><br>


            "Arcade," said the beautiful Archangel, "Nectaire will perhaps reveal to you 
            to-day the things you are burning to know.  <br><br>
            
            Ask him to speak." <br><br>
            
            
            Arcade did so and old Nectaire, laying down his pipe, began as follows:— 
            "I knew him.  <br><br>
            
            He was the most beautiful of all the Seraphim.  <br><br>
            
            He shone with 
            intelligence and daring.  <br><br>
            
            His great heart was big with all the virtues born of 
            pride: frankness, courage, constancy in trial, indomitable hope.  <br><br>
            
            Long, long 
            ago, ere Time was, in the boreal sky where gleam the seven magnetic stars, 
            he dwelt in a palace of diamond and gold, where the air was ever tremulous 
            with the beating of wings and with songs of triumph.  <br><br>
            
            Iahveh, on his 
            mountain, was jealous of Lucifer.  <br><br>
            
            You both know it: angels like unto men 
            feel love and hatred quicken within them.  <br><br>
            
            Capable, at times, of generous 
            resolves, they too often follow their own interests and yield to fear.  <br><br>
            
            Then, as 
            now, they showed themselves, for the most part, incapable of lofty thoughts, 
            and in the fear of the Lord lay their sole virtue.  <br><br>
            
            Lucifer, who held vile things 
            in proud disdain, despised this rabble of commonplace spirits for ever 
            wallowing in a life of feasts and pleasure.  <br><br>
            
            But to those who were possessed 
            of a daring spirit, a restless soul, to those fired with a wild love of liberty, he 
            proffered friendship, which was returned with adoration.  <br><br>
            
            These latter 
            deserted in a mass the mountain of God and yielded to the Seraph the 
            homage which That Other would fain have kept for himself alone.  <br><br>


            "I ranked among the Dominations, and my name, Alaciel, was not unknown 
            to fame.  <br><br>
            
            To satisfy my mind—that was ever tormented with an insatiable 
            thirst for knowledge and understanding—I observed the nature of things, I 
            studied the properties of minerals, air, and water.  <br><br>
            
            I sought out the laws 
            which govern nature, solid or ethereal, and after much pondering I perceived 
            that the Universe had not been formed as its pretended Creator would have 
            us believe; I knew that all that exists, exists of itself and not by the caprice 
            of Iahveh; that the world is itself its own creator and the spirit its own God.  <br><br>


            Henceforth I despised Iahveh for his imposture, and I hated him because he 
            showed himself to be opposed to all that I found desirable and good: liberty, 
            curiosity, doubt.  <br><br>
            
            These feelings drew me towards the Seraph.  <br><br>
            
            I admired him, 
            I loved him.  <br><br>
            
            I dwelt in his light.  <br><br>
            
            When at length it appeared that a choice had 
            to be made between him and That Other I ranged myself on the side of 
            Lucifer and knew no other aim than to serve him, no other desire than to 
            share his lot.  <br><br>


            "War having become inevitable, he prepared for it with indefatigable 
            vigilance and all the resourcefulness of a far-seeing mind.  <br><br>
            
            Making the 
            Thrones and Dominations into Chalybes and Cyclopes, he drew forth iron 
            from the mountains bordering his domain; iron, which he valued more than 
            gold, and forged weapons in the caverns of Heaven.  <br><br>
            
            Then in the desert plain 
            of the North he assembled myriads of Spirits, armed them, taught them, and 
            drilled them.  <br><br>
            
            Although prepared in secret, the enterprise was too vast for his 
            adversary not to be soon aware of it.  <br><br>
            
            It might in truth be said that he had 
            always foreseen and dreaded it, for he had made a citadel of his abode and a 
            warlike host of his angels, and he gave himself the name of the God of 
            Hosts.  <br><br>
            
            He made ready his thunderbolts.  <br><br>
            
            More than half of the children of 
            Heaven remained faithful to him; thronging round him he beheld obedient 
            souls and patient hearts.  <br><br>
            
            The Archangel Michael, who knew not fear, took 
            command of these docile troops.  <br><br>
            
            Lucifer, as soon as he saw that his army 
            could gain no more in numbers or in warlike skill, moved it swiftly against 
            the foe, and promising his angels riches and glory marched at their head 
            towards the mountain upon whose summit stands the Throne of the 
            Universe.  <br><br>
            
            For three days our host swept onward over the ethereal plains.  <br><br>


            Above our heads streamed the black standards of revolt.  <br><br>
            
            And now, behold, 
            the Mountain of God shone rosy in the orient sky and our chief scanned 
            with his eyes the glittering ramparts.  <br><br>
            
            Beneath the sapphire walls the foe was 
            drawn up in battle array, and, while we marched clad in our iron and 
            bronze, they shone resplendent in gold and precious stones.  <br><br>


            "Their gonfalons of red and blue floated in the breeze, and lightning flashed 
            from the points of their lances.  <br><br>
            
            In a little while the armies were only 
            sundered one from the other by a narrow strip of level and deserted ground, 
            and at this sight even the bravest shuddered as they thought that there in 
            bloody conflict their fate would soon be sealed.  <br><br>


            "Angels, as you know, never die.  <br><br>
            
            But when bronze and iron, diamond point 
            or flaming sword tear their ethereal substance, the pain they feel is more 
            acute than men may suffer, for their flesh is more exquisitely delicate; and 
            should some essential organ be destroyed, they fall inert and, slowly 
            decomposing, are resolved into clouds and during long æons float insensible 
            in the cold ether.  <br><br>
            
            And when at length they resume spirit and form they fail 
            to recover full memory of their past life.  <br><br>
            
            Therefore it is but natural that 
            angels shrink from suffering, and the bravest among them is troubled at the 
            thought of being reft of light and sweet remembrance.  <br><br>
            
            Were it otherwise the 
            angelic race would know neither the delight of battle nor the glory of 
            sacrifice.  <br><br>
            
            Those who, before the beginning of Time, fought in the Empyrean 
            for or against the God of Armies, would have taken part without honour in 
            mock battles, and it would not now become me to say to you, my children, 
            with rightful pride: 
            "'Lo, I was there!' 
            "Lucifer gave the signal for the onset and led the assault.  <br><br>
            
            We fell upon the 
            enemy, thinking to destroy him then and there and carry the sacred citadel 
            at the first onslaught.  <br><br>
            
            The soldiers of the jealous God, less fiery, but no whit 
            less firm than ours, remained immovable.  <br><br>
            
            The Archangel Michael 
            commanded them with the calmness and resolution of a mighty spirit.  <br><br>


            Thrice we strove to break through their lines, thrice they opposed to our 
            ironclad breast the flaming points of their lances, swift to pierce the stoutest 
            cuirass.  <br><br>
            
            In millions the glorious bodies fell.  <br><br>
            
            At length our right wingpierced 
            the enemy's left and we beheld the Principalities, the Powers, the Virtues, 
            the Dominations, and the Thrones turn and flee in full career; while the 
            Angels of the Third Choir, flying distractedly above them, covered them with 
            a snow of feathers mingled with a rain of blood.  <br><br>
            
            We sped in pursuit of them 
            amid the débris of chariots and broken weapons, and we spurred their 
            nimble flight.  <br><br>
            
            Suddenly a storm of cries amazed us.  <br><br>
            
            It grew louder and 
            nearer.  <br><br>
            
            With desperate shrieks and triumphal clamour the right wing of the 
            enemy, the giant archangels of the Most High, had flung themselves upon 
            our left flank and broken it.  <br><br>
            
            Thus we were forced to abandon the pursuit of 
            the fugitives and hasten to the rescue of our own shattered troops.  <br><br>
            
            Our 
            prince flew to rally them, and re-established the conflict.  <br><br>
            
            But the left wing of 
            the enemy, whose ruin he had not quite consummated, no longer pressed by 
            lance or arrow, regained courage, returned, and faced us yet again.  <br><br>
            
            Night fell 
            upon the dubious field.  <br><br>
            
            While under the shelter of darkness, in the still, 
            silent air stirred ever and anon by the moans of the wounded, his forces 
            were resting from their toils, Lucifer began to make ready for the next day's 
            battle.  <br><br>
            
            Before dawn the trumpets sounded the reveille.  <br><br>
            
            Our warriors 
            surprised the enemy at the hour of prayer, put them to rout, and long and 
            fierce was the carnage that ensued.  <br><br>
            
            When all had either fallen or fled, the 
            Archangel Michael, none with him save a few companions with four wings of 
            flame, still resisted the onslaughts of a countless host.  <br><br>
            
            They fell back 
            ceaselessly opposing their breasts to us, and Michael still displayed an 
            impassible countenance.  <br><br>
            
            The sun had run a third of its course when we 
            commenced to scale the Mountain of God.  <br><br>
            
            An arduous ascent it was: sweat 
            ran from our brows, a dazzling light blinded us.  <br><br>
            
            Weighed down with steel, 
            our feathery wings could not sustain us, but hope gave us wings that bore 
            us up.  <br><br>
            
            The beautiful Seraph, pointing with glittering hand, mounting ever 
            higher and higher, showed us the way.  <br><br>
            
            All day long we slowly clomb the lofty 
            heights which at evening were robed in azure, rose, and violet.  <br><br>
            
            The starry 
            host appearing in the sky seemed as the reflection of our own arms.  <br><br>
            
            Infinite 
            silence reigned above us.  <br><br>
            
            We went on, intoxicated with hope; all at once 
            from the darkened sky lightning darted forth, the thunder muttered, and 
            from the cloudy mountain-top fell fire from Heaven.  <br><br>
            
            Our helmets, our 
            breast-plates were running with flames, and our bucklers broke under bolts 
            sped by invisible hands.  <br><br>
            
            Lucifer, in the storm of fire, retained his haughty 
            mien.  <br><br>
            
            In vain the lightning smote him; mightier than ever he stood erect, 
            and still defied the foe.  <br><br>
            
            At length, the thunder, making the mountain totter, 
            flung us down pell-mell, huge fragments of sapphire and ruby crashing 
            down with us as we fell, and we rolled inert, swooning, for a period whose 
            duration none could measure.  <br><br>


            "I awoke in a darkness filled with lamentations.  <br><br>
            
            And when my eyes had 
            grown accustomed to the dense shadows I saw round me my companions in 
            arms, scattered in thousands on the sulphurous ground, lit by fitful gleams 
            of livid light.  <br><br>
            
            My eyes perceived but fields of lava, smoking craters, and 
            poisonous swamps.  <br><br>


            "Mountains of ice and shadowy seas shut in the horizon.  <br><br>
            
            A brazen sky hung 
            heavy on our brows.  <br><br>
            
            And the horror of the place was such that we wept as 
            we sat, crouched elbow on knee, our cheeks resting on our clenched hands.  <br><br>


            "But soon, raising my eyes, I beheld the Seraph standing before me like a 
            tower.  <br><br>
            
            Over his pristine splendour sorrow had cast its mantle of sombre 
            majesty.  <br><br>


            "'Comrades,' said he, 'we must be happy and rejoice, for behold we are 
            delivered from celestial servitude.  <br><br>
            
            Here we are free, and it were better to be 
            free in Hell than serve in Heaven.  <br><br>
            
            We are not conquered, since the will to 
            conquer is still ours.  <br><br>
            
            We have caused the Throne of the jealous God to totter; 
            by our hands it shall fall.  <br><br>
            
            Arise, therefore, and be of good heart.' <br><br>
            
            
            "Thereupon, at his command, we piled mountain upon mountain and on the 
            topmost peak we reared engines which flung molten rocks against the divine 
            habitations.  <br><br>
            
            The celestial host was taken unaware and from the abodes of 
            glory there issued groans and cries of terror.  <br><br>
            
            And even then we thought to 
            re-enter in triumph on our high estate, but the Mountain of God was 
            wreathed with lightnings, and thunderbolts, falling on our fortress, crushed 
            it 
            to dust.  <br><br>
            
            After this fresh disaster, the Seraph remained awhile in 
            meditation, his head buried in his hands.  <br><br>
            
            At length he raised his darkened 
            visage.  <br><br>
            
            Now he was Satan, greater than Lucifer.  <br><br>
            
            Steadfast and loyal the 
            angels thronged about him.  <br><br>


            "'Friends,' he said, 'if victory is denied us now, it is because we are neither 
            worthy nor capable of victory.  <br><br>
            
            Let us determine wherein we have failed.  <br><br>


            Nature shall not be ruled, the sceptre of the Universe shall not be grasped, 
            Godhead shall not be won, save by knowledge alone.  <br><br>
            
            We must conquer the 
            thunder; to that task we must apply ourselves unwearyingly.  <br><br>
            
            It is not blind 
            courage (no one this day has shown more courage than have you) which will 
            win us the courts of Heaven; but rather study and reflection.  <br><br>
            
            In these silent 
            realms where we are fallen, let us meditate, seeking the hidden causes of 
            things; let us observe the course of Nature; let us pursue her with 
            compelling ardour and all-conquering desire; let us strive to penetrate her 
            infinite grandeur, her infinite minuteness.  <br><br>
            
            Let us seek to know when she is 
            barren and when she brings forth fruit; how she makes cold and heat, joy 
            and sorrow, life and death; how she assembles and disperses her elements, 
            how she produces both the light air we breathe and the rocks of diamond 
            and sapphire whence we have been precipitated, the divine fire wherewith 
            we have been scarred and the soaring thought which stirs our minds.  <br><br>
            
            Torn 
            with dire wounds, scorched by flame and by ice, let us render thanks to Fate 
            which has sedulously opened our eyes, and let us rejoice at our lot.  <br><br>
            
            It is 
            through pain that, suffering a first experience of Nature, we have been 
            roused to know her and to subdue her.  <br><br>
            
            When she obeys us we shall be as 
            gods.  <br><br>
            
            But even though she hide her mysteries for ever from us, deny us 
            arms and keep the secret of the thunder, we still must needs congratulate 
            ourselves on having known pain, for pain has revealed to us new feelings, 
            more precious and more sweet than those experienced in eternal bliss, and 
            inspired us with love and pity unknown to Heaven.' <br><br>
            
            
            "These words of the Seraph changed our hearts and opened up fresh hope to 
            us.  <br><br>
            
            Our hearts were filled with a great longing for knowledge and love.  <br><br>


            "Meanwhile the Earth was coming into being.  <br><br>
            
            Its immense and nebulous orb 
            took on hourly more shape and more certainty of outline.  <br><br>
            
            The waters which 
            fed the seaweed, the madrepores and shellfish and bore the light flotilla of 
            the nautilus upon their bosom, no longer covered it in its entirety; they 
            began to sink into beds, and already continents appeared, where, on the 
            warm slime, amphibious monsters crawled.  <br><br>
            
            Then the mountains were 
            overspread with forests, and divers races of animals commenced to feed on 
            the grass, the moss, the berries on the trees, and on the acorns.  <br><br>
            
            Then there 
            took possession of cavernous shelters under the rocks, a being who was 
            cunning to wound with a sharpened stone the savage beasts, and by his 
            ruses to overcome the ancient denizens of forest, plain, and mountain.  <br><br>


            "Man entered painfully on his kingdom.  <br><br>
            
            He was defenceless and naked.  <br><br>
            
            His 
            scanty hair afforded him but little protection from the cold.  <br><br>
            
            His hands ended 
            in nails too frail to do battle with the claws of wild beasts, but the position of 
            his thumb, in opposition to the rest of his fingers, allowed him easily to 
            grasp the most diverse objects and endowed him with skill in default of 
            strength.  <br><br>
            
            Without differing essentially from the rest of the animals, he was 
            more capable than any others of observing and comparing.  <br><br>
            
            As he drew from 
            his throat various sounds, it occurred to him to designate by a particular 
            inflexion of the voice whatever impinged upon his mind, and by this 
            sequence of different sounds he was enabled to fix and communicate his 
            ideas.  <br><br>
            
            His miserable lot and his painstaking spirit aroused the sympathy of 
            the vanquished angels, who discerned in him an audacity equalling 
            theirown, and the germ of the pride that was at once their glory and their 
            bane.  <br><br>
            
            They came in large numbers to be near him, to dwell on this young 
            earth whither their wings wafted them in effortless flight.  <br><br>
            
            And they took 
            pleasure in sharpening his talents and fostering his genius.  <br><br>
            
            They taught him 
            to clothe himself in the skins of wild beasts, to roll stones before the mouths 
            of caves to keep out the tigers and bears.  <br><br>
            
            They taught him how to make the 
            flame burst forth by twirling a stick among the dried leaves and to foster the 
            sacred fire upon the hearth.  <br><br>
            
            Inspired by the ingenious spirits he dared to 
            cross the rivers in the hollowed trunks of cleft trees, he invented the wheel, 
            the grinding-mill, and the plough; the share tore up the earth and the 
            wound brought forth fruit, and the grain offered to him who ground it divine 
            nourishment.  <br><br>
            
            He moulded vessels in clay, and out of the flint he fashioned 
            various tools.  <br><br>


            "In fine, taking up our abode among mankind, we consoled them and taught 
            them.  <br><br>
            
            We were not always visible to them, but of an evening, at the turn of 
            the road, we would appear to them under forms often strange and weird, at 
            times dignified and charming, and we adopted at will the appearance of a 
            monster of the woods and waters, of a venerable old man, of a beautiful 
            child, or of a woman with broad hips.  <br><br>
            
            Sometimes we would mock them in 
            our songs or test their intelligence by some cunning prank.  <br><br>
            
            There were 
            certain of us of a rather turbulent humour who loved to tease their women 
            and children, but though lowly folk, they were our brothers, and we were 
            never loath to come to their aid.  <br><br>
            
            Through our care their intelligence 
            developed sufficiently to attain to mistaken ideas, and to acquire erroneous 
            notions of the relations of cause and effect.  <br><br>
            
            As they supposed that some 
            magic bond existed between the reality and its counterfeit presentment, they 
            covered the walls of their caves with figures of animals and carved in ivory 
            images of the reindeer and the mammoth in order to secure as prey the 
            creatures they represented.  <br><br>
            
            Centuries passed by with infinite slowness while 
            their genius was coming to birth.  <br><br>
            
            We sent them happy thoughts in dreams, 
            inspired them to tame the horse, to castrate the bull, to teach the dog to 
            guard the sheep.  <br><br>
            
            They created the family and the tribe.  <br><br>
            
            It came to pass one 
            day that one of their wandering tribes was assailed by ferocious hunters.  <br><br>


            Forthwith the young men of the tribe formed an enclosed ring with their 
            chariots, and in it they shut their women, children, old people, cattle, and 
            treasures, and from the platform of their chariots they hurled murderous 
            stones at their assailants.  <br><br>
            
            Thus was formed the first city.  <br><br>
            
            Born in misery 
            and condemned to do murder by the law of Iahveh, man put his whole heart 
            into doing battle, and to war he was indebted for his noblest virtues.  <br><br>
            
            He 
            hallowed with his blood that sacred love of country which should (if man 
            fulfils his destiny to the very end) enfold the whole earth in peace.  <br><br>
            
            One of us, 
            Dædalus, brought him the axe, the plumb-line, and the sail.  <br><br>
            
            Thus we 
            rendered the existence of mortals less hard and difficult.  <br><br>
            
            By the shores of 
            the lakes they built dwellings of osier, where they might enjoy a meditative 
            quiet unknown to the other inhabitants of the earth, and when they had 
            learned to appease their hunger without too painful efforts we breathed into 
            their hearts the love of beauty.  <br><br>


            "They raised up pyramids, obelisks, towers, colossal statues which smiled 
            stiff and uncouth, and genetic symbols.  <br><br>
            
            Having learnt to know us or trying 
            at least to divine what manner of beings we were, they felt both friendship 
            and fear for us.  <br><br>
            
            The wisest among them watched us with sacred awe and 
            pondered our teaching.  <br><br>
            
            In their gratitude the people of Greece and of Asia 
            consecrated to us stones, trees, shadowy woods; offered us victims, and 
            sang us hymns; in fact we became gods in their sight, and they called us 
            Horus, Isis, Astarte, Zeus, Cybele, Demeter, and Triptolemus.  <br><br>
            
            Satan was 
            worshipped under the names of Evan, Dionysus, Iacchus, and Lenæus.  <br><br>
            
            He 
            showed in his various manifestations all the strength and beauty which it is 
            given to mortals to conceive.  <br><br>
            
            His eyes had the sweetness of the wood-violet, 
            his lips were brilliant with the ruby-red of the pomegranate, a down 
            finerthan the velvet of the peach covered his cheeks and his chin: his fair 
            hair, wound like a diadem and knotted loosely on the crown of his head, was 
            encircled with ivy.  <br><br>
            
            He charmed the wild beasts, and penetrating into the 
            deep forests drew to him all wild spirits, every thing that climbed in trees 
            and peered through the branches with wild and timid gaze.  <br><br>
            
            On all these 
            creatures fierce and fearful, that lived on bitter berries and beneath whose 
            hairy breasts a wild heart beat, half-human creatures of the woods—on all 
            he bestowed loving-kindness and grace, and they followed him drunk with 
            joy and beauty.  <br><br>
            
            He planted the vine and showed mortals how to crush the 
            grapes underfoot to make the wine flow.  <br><br>
            
            Magnificent and benign, he fared 
            across the world, a long procession following in his train.  <br><br>
            
            To bear him 
            company I took the form of a satyr; from my brow sprang two budding 
            horns.  <br><br>
            
            My nose was flat and my ears were pointed.  <br><br>
            
            Glands, like those of the 
            goat, hung on my neck, a goat's tail moved with my moving loins, and my 
            hairy legs ended in a black cloven hoof which beat the ground in cadence.  <br><br>


            "Dionysus fared on his triumphal march over the world.  <br><br>
            
            In his company I 
            passed through Lydia, the Phrygian fields, the scorching plains of Persia, 
            Media bristling with hoar-frost, Arabia Felix, and rich Asia where flourishing 
            cities were laved by the waves of the sea.  <br><br>
            
            He proceeded on a car drawn by 
            lions and lynxes, to the sound of flutes, cymbals, and drums, invented for 
            his mysteries.  <br><br>
            
            Bacchantes, Thyades, and Mænads, girt with the dappled 
            fawn-skin, waved the thyrsus encircled with ivy.  <br><br>
            
            He bore in his train the 
            Satyrs, whose joyous troop I led, Sileni, Pans, and Centaurs.  <br><br>
            
            Under his feet 
            flowers and fruit sprang to life, and striking the rocks with his wand he 
            made limpid streams gush forth.  <br><br>
            
            In the month of the Vintage he visited 
            Greece, and the villagers ran forth to meet him, stained with the green and 
            ruddy juices of the plants, they wore masks of wood, or bark, or leaves; in 
            their hands they bore earthen cups, and danced wanton dances.  <br><br>
            
            Their 
            womenfolk, imitating the companions of the God, their heads wreathed with 
            green smilax, fastened round their supple loins skins of fawn or goat.  <br><br>
            
            The 
            virgins twined about their throats garlands of fig leaves, they kneaded cakes 
            of flour, and bore the Phallus in the mystic basket.  <br><br>
            
            And the vine-dressers, 
            all daubed with lees of wine, standing up in their wains and bandying 
            mockery or abuse with the passers-by, invented Tragedy.  <br><br>


            "Truly, it was not in dreaming beside a fountain, but by dint of strenuous 
            toil that Dionysus taught them to grow plants and to make them bring forth 
            succulent fruits.  <br><br>
            
            And while he pondered the art of transforming the rough 
            woodlanders into a race that should love music and submit to just laws, 
            more than once over his brow, burning with the fire of enthusiasm, did 
            melancholy and gloomy fever pass.  <br><br>
            
            But his profound knowledge and his 
            friendship for mankind enabled him to triumph over every obstacle.  <br><br>
            
            O days 
            divine! Beautiful dawn of life! We led the Bacchanals on the leafy summits of 
            the mountains and on the yellow shores of the seas.  <br><br>
            
            The Naiads and the 
            Oreads mingled with us at our play.  <br><br>
            
            Aphrodite at our coming rose from the 
            foam of the sea to smile upon us." <br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">THE GARDENER'S STORY, CONTINUED</p>

        <p>
          HEN men had learned to cultivate the earth, to herd cattle, to enclose their 
          holy places within walls, and to recognise the gods by their beauty, I 
          withdrew to that smiling land girdled with dark woods and watered by the 
          Stymphalos, the Olbios, the Erymanthus, and the proud Crathis, swollen 
          with the icy waters of the Styx, and there, in a green valley at the foot of a 
          hill planted with arbutus, olive, and pine, beneath a cluster of white poplars 
          and plane trees, by the side of a stream flowing with soft murmur amid 
          tufted mastic trees, I sang to the shepherds and the nymphs of the birth of 
          the world, the origin of fire, of the tenuous air, of water and of earth. <br><br>
          
          I told 
          them how primeval men had lived wretched and naked in the woods, before 
          the ingenious spirits had taught them the arts; of God, too, I sang to them, 
          and why they gave Dionysus Semele to mother, because his desire to 
          befriend mankind was born amid the thunder. <br><br>


          "It was not without effort that this people, more pleasing than all the others 
          in the eyes of the gods, these happy Greeks, achieved good government and 
          a knowledge of the arts. <br><br>
          
          Their first temple was a hut composed of laurel 
          branches; their first image of the gods, a tree; their first altar, a rough stone 
          stained with the blood of Iphigenia. <br><br>
          
          But in a short time they brought wisdom 
          and beauty to a point that no nation had attained before them, that no 
          nation has since approached. <br><br>
          
          Whence comes it, Arcade, this solitary marvel 
          on the earth? Wherefore did the sacred soil of Ionia and of Attica bring forth 
          this incomparable flower? Because nor priesthood, nor dogma, nor 
          revelation ever found a place there, because the Greeks never knew the 
          jealous God. <br><br>


          "It was his own grace, his own genius that the Greek enthroned and deified 
          as his God, and when he raised his eyes to the heavens it was his own 
          image that he saw reflected there. <br><br>
          
          He conceived everything in due measure; 
          and to his temples he gave perfect proportion. <br><br>
          
          All therein was grace, 
          harmony, symmetry, and wisdom; all were worthy of the immortals who 
          dwelt within them and who under names of happy choice, in realised 
          shapes, figured forth the genius of man. <br><br>
          
          The columns which bore the marble 
          architrave, the frieze and the cornice were touched with something human, 
          which made them venerable; and sometimes one might see, as at Athens 
          and at Delphi, beautiful young girls strong-limbed and radiant upstaying the 
          entablature of treasure house and sanctuary. <br><br>
          
          O days of splendour, 
          harmony, and wisdom! 
          "Dionysus resolved to repair to Italy, whither he was summoned under the 
          name of Bacchus by a people eager to celebrate his mysteries. <br><br>
          
          I took passage 
          in his ship decked with tendrils of the vine, and landed under the eyes of the 
          two brothers of Helen at the mouth of the yellow Tiber. <br><br>
          
          Already under the 
          teaching of the god, the inhabitants of Latium had learned to wed the vine to 
          the young stripling elm. <br><br>
          
          It was my pleasure to dwell at the foot of the Sabine 
          hills in a valley crowned with trees and watered with pure springs. <br><br>
          
          I 
          gathered the verbena and the mallow in the meadows. <br><br>
          
          The pale olive-trees 
          twisting their perforated trunks on the slope of the hill gave me of their 
          unctuous fruit. <br><br>
          
          There I taught a race of men with square heads, who had 
          not, like the Greeks, a fertile mind, but whose hearts were true, whose souls 
          were patient, and who reverenced the gods. <br><br>
          
          My neighbour, a rustic soldier, 
          who for fifteen years had bowed under the burden of his haversack, had 
          followed the Roman eagle over land and sea, and had seen the enemies of 
          the sovereign people flee before him. <br><br>
          
          Now he drove his furrow with his two 
          red oxen, starred with white between their spreading horns, while beneath 
          the cabin's thatch his spouse, chaste and sedate of mien, pounded garlic in 
          a bronze mortar and cooked the beans upon the sacred hearth, And I, his 
          friend, seated near by under an oak, used to lighten his labours with the 
          sound of my flute, and smile on his little children, when the sun, already 
          low in the sky, was lengthening the shadows, and they returned from the 
          wood all laden with branches. <br><br>
          
          At the garden gate where the pears and 
          pumpkins ripened, and where the lily and the evergreen acanthus bloomed, 
          a figure of Priapus carved out of the trunk of a fig tree menaced thieves with 
          his formidable emblem, and the reeds swaying with the wind over his head 
          scared away the plundering birds. <br><br>
          
          At new moon the pious husbandman 
          made offering of a handful of salt and barley to his household gods crowned 
          with myrtle and with rosemary. <br><br>


          "I saw his children grow up, and his children's children, who kept in their 
          hearts their early piety and did not forget to offer sacrifice to Bacchus, to 
          Diana, and to Venus, nor omit to pour fresh wines and scatter flowers into 
          the fountains. <br><br>
          
          But slowly they fell away from their old habits of patient toil 
          and simplicity. <br><br>


          "I heard them complain when the torrent, swollen with many rains, 
          compelled them to construct a dyke to protect the paternal fields, and the 
          rough Sabine wine grew unpleasing to their delicate palate. <br><br>
          
          They went to 
          drink the wines of Greece at the neighbouring tavern; and the hours slipped 
          unheeded by, while within the arbour shade they watched the dance of the 
          flute player, practised at swaying her supple limbs to the sound of the 
          castanets. <br><br>


          "Lulled by murmuring leaves and whispering streams, the tillers of the soil 
          took sweet repose, but between the poplars we saw along borders of the 
          sacred way vast tombs, statues, and altars arise, and the rolling of the 
          chariot wheels grew more frequent over the worn stones. <br><br>
          
          A cherry sapling 
          brought home by a veteran told us of the far-distant conquests of a Consul, 
          and odes sung to the lyre related the victories of Rome, mistress of the 
          world. <br><br>


          "All the countries where the great Dionysus had journeyed, changing wild 
          beasts into men, and making the fruit and grain bloom and ripen beneath 
          the passing of his Mænads, now breathed the Pax Romana. <br><br>
          
          The nursling of 
          the she-wolf, soldier and labourer, friend of conquered nations, laid out 
          roads from the margin of the misty sea to the rocky slopes of the Caucasus; 
          in every town rose the temple of Augustus and of Rome, and such was the 
          universal faith in Latin justice that in the gorges of Thessaly or on the 
          wooded borders of the Rhine, the slave, ready to succumb under his 
          iniquitous burden, called aloud on the name of Cæsar. <br><br>


          "But why must it be that on this ill-starred globe of land and water, all 
          should perish and die and the fairest things be ever the most fleeting? O 
          adorable daughters of Greece! O Science! O Wisdom! O Beauty! kindly 
          divinities, you were wrapt in heavy slumber ere you submitted to the 
          outrages of the barbarians, who already in the marshy wastes of the North 
          and on the lonely steppes, ready to assail you, bestrode bare-backed their 
          little shaggy horses. <br><br>


          "While, dear Arcade, the patient legionary camped by the borders of the 
          Phasis and the Tanais, the women and the priests of Asia and of monstrous 
          Africa invaded the Eternal City and troubled the sons of Remus with their 
          magic spells. <br><br>
          
          Until now, Iahveh, the persecutor of the laborious demons, 
          was unknown to the world that he pretended to have created, save to certain 
          miserable Syrian tribes, ferocious like himself, and perpetually dragged from 
          servitude to servitude. <br><br>
          
          Profiting by the Roman peace which assured free 
          travel and traffic everywhere, and favoured the exchange of ideas and 
          merchandise, this old God insolently made ready to conquer the Universe. <br><br>


          He was not the only one, for the matter of that, to attempt such an 
          undertaking. <br><br>
          
          At the same time a crowd of gods, demiurges, and demons, 
          such as Mithra, Thammuz, the good Isis, and Eubulus, meditated taking 
          possession of the peace-enfolded world. <br><br>
          
          Of all the spirits, Iahveh appeared 
          the least prepared for victory. <br><br>
          
          His ignorance, his cruelty, his ostentation, his 
          Asiatic luxury, his disdain of laws, his affectation of rendering himself 
          invisible, all these things were calculated to offend those Greeks and Latins 
          who had absorbed the teaching of Dionysus and the Muses. <br><br>
          
          He himself felt 
          he was incapable of winning the allegiance of free men and of cultivated 
          minds, and he employed cunning. <br><br>
          
          To seduce their souls he invented a fable 
          which, although not so ingenious as the myths wherewith we have 
          surrounded the spirits of our disciples of old, could, nevertheless, influence 
          those feebler intellects which are to be found everywhere in great masses. <br><br>


          He declared that men having committed a crime against him, an hereditary 
          crime, should pay the penalty for it in their present life and in the life to 
          come (for mortals vainly imagine that their existence is prolonged in hell); 
          and the astute Iahveh gave out that he had sent his own son to earth to 
          redeem with his blood the debt of mankind. <br><br>
          
          It is not credible that a penalty 
          should redress a fault, and it is still less credible that the innocent should 
          pay for the guilty. <br><br>
          
          The sufferings of the innocent atone for nothing, and do 
          but add one evil to another. <br><br>
          
          Nevertheless, unhappy creatures were found to 
          adore Iahveh and his son, the expiator, and to announce their mysteries as 
          good tidings. <br><br>
          
          We should not be surprised at this folly. <br><br>
          
          Have we not seen 
          many times indeed human beings who, poor and naked, prostrate 
          themselves before all the phantoms of fear, and rather than follow the 
          teaching of well-disposed demons, obey the commandments of cruel 
          demiurges? Iahveh, by his cunning, took souls as in a net. <br><br>
          
          But he did not 
          gain therefrom, for his glorification, all that he expected. <br><br>
          
          It was not he, but 
          his son, who received the homage of mankind, and who gave his name to 
          the new cult. <br><br>
          
          He himself remained almost unknown upon earth."<br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">THE GARDENER'S STORY, CONTINUED</p>

        <p>
          HE new superstition spread at first over Syria and Africa; it won over the 
          seaports where the filthy rabble swarm, and, penetrating into Italy, infected 
          at first the courtesans and the slaves, and then made rapid progress among 
          the middle classes of the towns.  <br><br>
          
          But for a long while the country-side 
          remained undisturbed.  <br><br>
          
          As in the past, the villagers consecrated a pine tree 
          to Diana, and sprinkled it every year with the blood of a young boar; they 
          propitiated their Lares with the sacrifice of a sow, and offered to Bacchus—
          benefactor of mankind—a kid of dazzling whiteness, or if they were too poor 
          for this, at least they had a little wine and a little flour from the vineyard 
          and from the fields for their household gods.  <br><br>
          
          We had taught them that it 
          sufficed to approach the altar with clean hands, and that the gods rejoiced 
          over a modest offering.  <br><br>


          "Nevertheless, the reign of Iahveh proclaimed its advent in a hundred places 
          by its extravagances.  <br><br>
          
          The Christians burnt books, overthrew temples, setfire 
          to the towns, and carried on their ravages as far as the deserts.  <br><br>
          
          There, 
          thousands of unhappy beings, turning their fury against themselves, 
          lacerated their sides with points of steel.  <br><br>
          
          And from the whole earth the sighs 
          of voluntary victims rose up to God like songs of praise.  <br><br>


          "My shadowy retreat could not escape for long from the fury of their 
          madness.  <br><br>


          "On the summit of the hill which overlooked the olive woods, brightened 
          daily with the sounds of my flute, had stood since the earliest days of the 
          Pax Romana, a small marble temple, round as the huts of our forefathers.  <br><br>
          
          It 
          had no walls, but on a base of seven steps, sixteen columns rose in a circle 
          with the acanthus on the capitals, bearing a cupola of white tiles.  <br><br>
          
          This 
          cupola sheltered a statue of Love fashioning his bow, the work of an 
          Athenian sculptor.  <br><br>
          
          The child seemed to breathe, joy was welling from his 
          lips, all his limbs were harmonious and polished.  <br><br>
          
          I honoured this image of 
          the most powerful of all the gods, and I taught the villagers to bear to him as 
          an offering a cup crowned with verbena and filled with wine two summers 
          old.  <br><br>


          "One day, when seated as my custom was at the feet of the god, pondering 
          precepts and songs, an unknown man, wild-looking, with unkempt hair, 
          approached the temple, sprang at one bound up the marble steps, and with 
          savage glee exclaimed: 
          "'Die, poisoner of souls, and joy and beauty perish with you.' <br><br>
          
          He spoke thus, 
          and drawing an axe from his girdle raised it against the god.  <br><br>
          
          I stayed his 
          arm, I threw him down, and trampled him under my feet.  <br><br>


          "'Demon,' he cried desperately, 'suffer me to overturn this idol, and you may 
          slay me afterwards.' <br><br>
          
          
          "I heeded not his atrocious plea, but leaned with all my might on his chest, 
          which cracked under my knee, and, squeezing his throat with my two 
          hands, I strangled the impious one.  <br><br>


          "While he lay there, with purple face and lolling tongue, at the feet of the 
          smiling god, I went to purify myself at the sacred stream.  <br><br>
          
          Then leaving this 
          land, now the prey of the Christian, I passed through Gaul and gained the 
          banks of the Saône, whither Dionysus had, in days gone by, carried the 
          vine.  <br><br>
          
          The god of the Christians had not yet been proclaimed to this happy 
          people.  <br><br>
          
          They worshipped for its beauty a leafy beech-tree, whose honoured 
          branches swept the ground, and they hung fillets of wool thereon.  <br><br>
          
          They also 
          worshipped a sacred stream and set up images of clay in a dripping grotto.  <br><br>


          They made offering of little cheeses and a bowl of milk to the Nymphs of the 
          woods and mountains.  <br><br>


          "But soon an apostle of sorrow was sent to them by the new God.  <br><br>
          
          He was 
          drier than a smoked fish.  <br><br>
          
          Although attenuated with fasting and watching, he 
          taught with unabated ardour all manner of gloomy mysteries.  <br><br>
          
          He loved 
          suffering, and thought it good; his anger fell upon all that was beautiful, 
          comely, and joyous.  <br><br>
          
          The sacred tree fell beneath his hatchet.  <br><br>
          
          He hated the 
          Nymphs, because they were beautiful, and he flung imprecations at them 
          when their shining limbs gleamed among the leaves at evening, and he held 
          my melodious flute in aversion.  <br><br>
          
          The poor wretch thought that there were 
          certain forms of words wherewith to put to flight the deathless spirits that 
          dwell in the cool groves, and in the depths of the woods and on the tops of 
          the mountains.  <br><br>
          
          He thought to conquer us with a few drops of water over 
          which he had pronounced certain words and made certain gestures.  <br><br>
          
          The 
          Nymphs, to avenge themselves, appeared to him at nightfall and inflamed 
          him with desire which the foolish knave thought animal; then they fled, 
          their laughter scattered like grain over the fields, while their victim lay 
          tossing with burning limbs on his couch of leaves.  <br><br>
          
          Thus do the divine 
          nymphs laugh at exorcisers, and mock the wicked and their sordid chastity.  <br><br>


          "The apostle did not do as much harm as he wished, because his teaching 
          was given to the simple souls living in obedience to Nature, and because the 
          mediocrity of most of mankind is such that they gain but little from the 
          principles inculcated in them.  <br><br>
          
          The little wood in which I dwelt belonged to a 
          Gaul of senatorial family, who retained some traces of Latin elegance.  <br><br>
          
          He 
          loved his young freed-woman and shared with her his bed of broidered 
          purple.  <br><br>
          
          His slaves cultivated his garden and his vineyard; he was a poet and 
          sang, in imitation of Ausonius, Venus whipping her son with roses.  <br><br>


          Although a Christian, he offered me milk, fruit, and vegetables as if I were 
          the genius of the place.  <br><br>
          
          In return I charmed his idle moments with the 
          music of my flute, and I gave him happy dreams.  <br><br>
          
          In fact, these peaceful 
          Gauls knew very little of Iahveh and his son.  <br><br>


          "But now behold fires looming on the horizon, and ashes driven by the wind 
          fall within our forest glades.  <br><br>
          
          Peasants come driving a long file of waggons 
          along the roads or urging their flocks before them.  <br><br>
          
          Cries of terror rise from 
          the villages, 'The Burgundians are upon us!' 
          "Now one horseman is seen, lance in hand, clad in shining bronze, his long 
          red hair falling in two plaits on his shoulders.  <br><br>
          
          Then come two, then twenty, 
          then thousands, wild and blood-stained; old men and children they put to 
          the sword, ay, even aged grandams whose grey hairs cleave to the soles of 
          the slaughterer's boots, mingled with the brains of babes new-born.  <br><br>
          
          My 
          young Gaul and his young freed-woman stain with their blood the couch 
          broidered with narcissi.  <br><br>
          
          The barbarians burn the basilicas to roast their 
          oxen whole, shatter the amphoræ, and drain the wine in the mud of 
          theflooded cellars.  <br><br>
          
          Their women accompany them, huddled, half naked, in 
          their war chariots.  <br><br>
          
          When the Senate, the dwellers in the cities, and the 
          leaders of the churches had perished in the flames, the Burgundians, 
          soddened with wine, lay down to slumber beneath the arcades of the Forum.  <br><br>


          Two weeks later one of them might have been seen smiling in his shaggy 
          beard at the little child whom, on the threshold of their dwelling, his fair
          haired spouse gathers in her arms; while another, kindling the fire of his 
          forge, hammers out his iron with measured stroke; another sings beneath 
          the oak tree to his assembled comrades of the gods and heroes of his race; 
          and yet others spread out for sale stones fallen from Heaven, aurochs' 
          horns, and amulets.  <br><br>
          
          And the former inhabitants of the country, regaining 
          courage little by little, crept from the woods where they had fled for refuge, 
          and returned to rebuild their burnt-down cabins, plough their fields, and 
          prune their vines.  <br><br>


          "Once more life resumed its normal course; but those times were the most 
          wretched that mankind had yet experienced.  <br><br>
          
          The barbarians swarmed over 
          the whole Empire.  <br><br>
          
          Their ways were uncouth, and as they nurtured feelings 
          of vengeance and greed, they firmly believed in the ransom of sin.  <br><br>


          "The fable of Iahveh and his son pleased them, and they believed it all the 
          more easily in that it was taught them by the Romans whom they knew to 
          be wiser than themselves, and to whose arts and mode of life they yielded 
          secret admiration.  <br><br>
          
          Alas! the heritage of Greece and Rome had fallen into the 
          hands of fools.  <br><br>
          
          All knowledge was lost.  <br><br>
          
          In those days it was held to be a 
          great merit to sing among the choir, and those who remembered a few 
          sentences from the Bible passed for prodigious geniuses.  <br><br>
          
          There were still 
          poets as there were birds, but their verse went lame in every foot.  <br><br>
          
          The 
          ancient demons, the good genii of mankind, shorn of their honours, driven 
          forth, pursued, hunted down, remained hidden in the woods.  <br><br>
          
          There, if they 
          still showed themselves to men, they adopted, to hold them in awe, a terrible 
          face, a red, green, or black skin, baleful eyes, an enormous mouth fringed 
          with boars' teeth, horns, a tail, and sometimes a human face on their 
          bellies.  <br><br>
          
          The nymphs remained fair, and the barbarians, ignorant of the 
          winsome names they bore in other days, called them fairies, and, imputing 
          to them a capricious character and puerile tastes, both feared and loved 
          them.  <br><br>


          "We had suffered a grievous fall, and our ranks were sadly thinned; 
          nevertheless we did not lose courage and, maintaining a laughing aspect 
          and a benevolent spirit, we were in those direful days the real friends of 
          mankind.  <br><br>
          
          Perceiving that the barbarians grew daily less sombre and less 
          ferocious, we lent ourselves to the task of conversing with them under all 
          sorts of disguises.  <br><br>
          
          We incited them, with a thousand precautions, and by 
          prudent circumlocutions, not to acknowledge the old Iahveh as an infallible 
          master, not blindly to obey his orders, and not to fear his menaces.  <br><br>
          
          When 
          need was, we had recourse to magic.  <br><br>
          
          We exhorted them unceasingly to study 
          nature and to strive to discover the traces of ancient wisdom.  <br><br>


          "These warriors from the North—rude though they were—were acquainted 
          with some mechanical arts.  <br><br>
          
          They thought they saw combats in the heavens; 
          the sound of the harp drew tears from their eyes; and perchance they had 
          souls capable of greater things than the degenerate Gauls and Romans 
          whose lands they had invaded.  <br><br>
          
          They knew not how to hew stone or to polish 
          marble; but they caused porphyry and columns to be brought from Rome 
          and from Ravenna; their chief men took for their seal a gem engraved by a 
          Greek in the days when Beauty reigned supreme.  <br><br>
          
          They raised walls with 
          bricks, cunningly arranged like ears of corn, and succeeded in building 
          quite pleasing-looking churches with cornices upheld by consoles depicting 
          grim faces, and heavy capitals whereon were represented monsters 
          devouring one another.  <br><br>


          "We taught them letters and sciences.  <br><br>
          
          A mouthpiece of their god, one 
          Gerbert, took lessons in physics, arithmetic, and music with us, and it was 
          said that he had sold us his soul.  <br><br>
          
          Centuries passed, and man's ways 
          remained violent.  <br><br>
          
          It was a world given up to fire and blood.  <br><br>
          
          The successors 
          of the studious Gerbert, not content with the possession of souls (the profits 
          one gains thereby are lighter than air), wished to possess bodies also.  <br><br>
          
          They 
          pretended that their universal and prescriptive monarchy was held from a 
          fisherman on the lake of Tiberias.  <br><br>
          
          One of them thought for a moment to 
          prevail over the loutish Germanus, successor to Augustus.  <br><br>
          
          But finally the 
          spiritual had to come to terms with the temporal, and the nations were torn 
          between two opposing masters.  <br><br>


          "Nations took shape amid horrible tumult.  <br><br>
          
          On every side were wars, 
          famines, and internecine conflicts.  <br><br>
          
          Since they attributed the innumerable 
          ills that fell upon them to their God, they called him the Most Good, not by 
          way of irony, but because to them the best was he who smote the hardest.  <br><br>


          In those days of violence, to give myself leisure for study I adopted a rôle 
          which may surprise you, but which was exceedingly wise.  <br><br>


          "Between the Saône and the mountains of Charolais, where the cattle 
          pasture, there lies a wooded hill sloping gently down to fields watered by a 
          clear stream.  <br><br>
          
          There stood a monastery celebrated throughout the Christian 
          world.  <br><br>
          
          I hid my cloven feet under a robe and became a monk in this Abbey, 
          where I lived peacefully, sheltered from the men at arms who to friend or foe 
          alike showed themselves equally exacting.  <br><br>
          
          Man, who had relapsed into 
          childhood, had all his lessons to learn over again.  <br><br>
          
          Brother Luke, whose cell 
          was next to mine, studied the habits of animals and taught us that the 
          weasel conceives her young within her ear.  <br><br>
          
          I culled simples in the fields 
          wherewith to soothe the sick, who until then were made by way of treatment 
          to touch the relics of saints.  <br><br>
          
          In the Abbey were several demons similar to 
          myself whom I recognised by their cloven feet and by their kindly speech.  <br><br>
          
          We 
          joined forces in our endeavours to polish the rough mind of the monks.  <br><br>


          "While the little children played at hop-scotch under the Abbey walls our 
          friends the monks devoted themselves to another game equally unprofitable, 
          at which, nevertheless, I joined them, for one must kill time,—that, when 
          one comes to think of it, is the sole business of life.  <br><br>
          
          Our game was a game of 
          words which pleased our coarse yet subtle minds, set school fulminating 
          against school, and put all Christendom in an uproar.  <br><br>
          
          We formed ourselves 
          into two opposing camps.  <br><br>
          
          One camp maintained that before there were 
          apples there was the Apple; that before there were popinjays there was the 
          Popinjay; that before there were lewd and greedy monks there was the 
          Monk, Lewdness and Greed; that before there were feet and before there 
          were posteriors in this world the kick in the posterior must have had 
          existence for all eternity in the bosom of God.  <br><br>
          
          The other camp replied 
          that,on the contrary, apples gave man the idea of the apple; popinjays the 
          idea of the popinjay; monks the idea of the monk, greed and lewdness, and 
          that the kick in the posterior existed only after having been duly given and 
          received.  <br><br>
          
          The players grew heated and came to fisticuffs.  <br><br>
          
          I was an adherent 
          of the second party, which satisfied my reason better, and which was, in 
          fact, condemned by the Council of Soissons.  <br><br>


          "Meanwhile, not content with fighting among themselves, vassal against 
          suzerain, suzerain against vassal, the great lords took it into their heads to 
          go and fight in the East.  <br><br>
          
          They said, as well as I can remember, that they 
          were going to deliver the tomb of the son of God.  <br><br>


          "They said so, but their adventurous and covetous spirit excited them to go 
          forth and seek lands, women, slaves, gold, myrrh, and incense.  <br><br>
          
          These 
          expeditions, need it be said, proved disastrous; but our thick-headed 
          compatriots brought back with them the knowledge of certain crafts and 
          oriental arts and a taste for luxury.  <br><br>
          
          Henceforth we had less difficulty in 
          making them work and in putting them in the way of inventions.  <br><br>
          
          We built 
          wonderfully beautiful churches, with daringly pierced arches, lancet-shaped 
          windows, high towers, thousands of pointed spires, which, rising in the sky 
          towards Iahveh, bore at one and the same time the prayers of the humble 
          and the threats of the proud, for it was all as much our doing as the work of 
          men's hands; and it was a strange sight to see men and demons working 
          together at a cathedral, each one sawing, polishing, collecting stones, 
          graving, on capital and on cornice, nettles, thorns, thistles, wild parsley, and 
          wild strawberry,—carving faces of virgins and saints and weird figures of 
          serpents, fishes with asses' heads, apes scratching their buttocks; each one, 
          in fact, putting his own particular talent,—mocking, sublime, grotesque, 
          modest, or audacious,—into the work and making of it all a harmonious 
          cacophony, a rapturous anthem of joy and sorrow, a Babel of victory.  <br><br>
          
          At our 
          instigation the carvers, the gold-smiths, the enamellers, accomplished 
          marvels and all the sumptuary arts flourished at once; there were silks at 
          Lyons, tapestries at Arras, linen at Rheims, cloth at Rouen.  <br><br>
          
          The good 
          merchants rode on their palfreys to the fairs, bearing pieces of velvet and 
          brocade, embroideries, orfrays, jewels, vessels of silver, and illuminated 
          books.  <br><br>
          
          Strollers and players set up their trestles in the churches and in the 
          public squares, and represented, according to their lights, simple chronicles 
          of Heaven, Earth, and Hell.  <br><br>
          
          Women decked themselves in splendid raiment 
          and lisped of love.  <br><br>


          "In the spring when the sky was blue, nobles and peasants were possessed 
          with the desire to make merry in the flower-strewn meadows.  <br><br>
          
          The fiddler 
          tuned his instrument, and ladies, knights and demoiselles, townsfolk, 
          villagers and maidens, holding hands, began the dance.  <br><br>
          
          But suddenly War, 
          Pestilence, and Famine entered the circle, and Death, tearing the violin from 
          the fiddler's hands, led the dance.  <br><br>
          
          Fire devoured village and monastery.  <br><br>
          
          The 
          men-at-arms hanged the peasants on the sign-posts at the cross-roads 
          when they were unable to pay ransom, and bound pregnant women to tree
          trunks, where at night the wolves came and devoured the fruit within the 
          womb.  <br><br>
          
          The poor people lost their senses.  <br><br>
          
          Sometimes, peace being re
          established, and good times come again, they were seized with mad, 
          unreasoning terror, abandoned their homes, and rushed hither and thither 
          in troops, half naked, tearing themselves with iron hooks, and singing.  <br><br>
          
          I do 
          not accuse Iahveh and his son of all this evil.  <br><br>
          
          Many ill things occurred 
          without him and even in spite of him.  <br><br>
          
          But where I recognise the instigation 
          of the All Good (as they called him) was in the custom instituted by his 
          pastors, and established throughout Christendom, of burning, to the sound 
          of bells and the singing of psalms, both men and women who, taught by the 
          demons, professed, concerning this God, opinions of their own." <br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">THE GARDENER'S STORY, CONCLUDED</p>

        <p>
          T seemed as if science and thought had perished for all eternity, and that 
          the earth would never again know peace, joy, and beauty. <br><br>


          "But one day, under the walls of Rome, some workmen, excavating the earth 
          on the borders of an ancient road, found a marble sarcophagus which bore 
          carved on its sides simulacra of Love and the triumphs of Bacchus. <br><br>


          "The lid being raised, a maiden appeared whose face shone with dazzling 
          freshness. <br><br>
          
          Her long hair spread over her white shoulders, she was smiling in 
          her sleep. <br><br>
          
          A band of citizens, thrilled with enthusiasm, raised the funeral 
          couch and bore it to the Capitol. <br><br>
          
          The people came in crowds to contemplate 
          the ineffable beauty of the Roman maiden and stood around in silence, 
          watching for the awakening of the divine soul held within this form of 
          adorable beauty. <br><br>


          "And it came to pass that the City was so greatly stirred by this spectacle 
          that the Pope, fearing, not without reason, the birth of a pagan cult from 
          thisradiant body, caused it to be removed at night and secretly buried. <br><br>
          
          The 
          precaution was vain, the labour fruitless. <br><br>
          
          After so many centuries of 
          barbarism, the beauty of the antique world had appeared for a moment 
          before the eyes of men; it was long enough for its image, graven on their 
          hearts, to inspire them with an ardent desire to love and to know. <br><br>


          "Henceforth, the star of the God of the Christians paled and sloped to its 
          decline. <br><br>
          
          Bold navigators discovered worlds inhabited by numerous races 
          who knew not old Iahveh, and it was suspected that he was no less ignorant 
          of them, since he had given them no news of himself or of his son the 
          expiator. <br><br>
          
          A Polish Canon demonstrated the true motions of the earth, and it 
          was seen that, far from having created the world, the old demiurge of Israel 
          had not even an inkling of its structure. <br><br>
          
          The writings of philosophers, 
          orators, jurisconsults, and ancient poets were dragged from the dust of the 
          cloisters and passing from hand to hand inspired men's minds with the love 
          of wisdom. <br><br>
          
          The Vicar of the jealous God, the Pope himself, no longer believed 
          in Him whom he represented on earth. <br><br>
          
          He loved the arts and had no other 
          care than to collect ancient statues and to rear sumptuous buildings 
          wherein were displayed the orders of Vitruvius re-established by Bramante. <br><br>


          We began to breathe anew. <br><br>
          
          Already the old gods, recalled from their long 
          exile, were returning to dwell upon earth. <br><br>
          
          There they found once more their 
          temples and their altars. <br><br>
          
          Leo, placing at their feet the ring, the three crowns, 
          and the keys, offered them in secret the incense of sacrifices. <br><br>
          
          Already 
          Polyhymnia, leaning on her elbow, had begun to resume the golden thread 
          of her meditations; already, in the gardens, the comely Graces and the 
          Nymphs and Satyrs were weaving their mazy dances, and at length the earth 
          had joy once more within its grasp. <br><br>
          
          But, O calamity, unlucky fate,—most 
          tragic circumstance! A German monk, all swollen with beer and theology, 
          rose up against this renaissance of paganism, hurled menaces against it, 
          shattered it, and prevailed single handed against the Princes of the Church. <br><br>


          Inciting the nations, he called upon them to undertake a reform which saved 
          that which was about to be destroyed. <br><br>
          
          Vainly did the cleverest among us try 
          to turn him from his work. <br><br>
          
          A subtle demon, on earth called Beelzebub, 
          marked him out for attack, now embarrassing him with learned 
          controversial argument, now tormenting him with cruel mockery. <br><br>
          
          The 
          stubborn monk hurled his ink-pot at his head and went on with his dismal 
          reformation. <br><br>
          
          What ultimately happened? The sturdy mariner repaired, 
          calked, and refloated the damaged ship of the Church. <br><br>
          
          Jesus Christ owes it 
          to this shaveling that his shipwreck was delayed for perhaps more than ten 
          centuries. <br><br>
          
          Henceforth things went from bad to worse. <br><br>
          
          In the wake of this 
          loutish monk, this beer-swiller and brawler, came that tall, dry doctor from 
          Geneva, who, filled with the spirit of the ancient Iahveh, strove to bring the 
          world back again to the abominable days of Joshua and the Judges of Israel. <br><br>


          A maniac was he, filled with cold fury, a heretic and a burner of heretics, the 
          most ferocious enemy of the Graces. <br><br>


          "These mad apostles and their mad disciples made even demons like myself, 
          even the horned devils, look back longingly on the time when the Son with 
          his Virgin Mother reigned over the nations dazzled with splendours: 
          cathedrals with their stone tracery delicate as lace, flaming roses of stained 
          glass, frescoes painted in vivid colours telling countless wondrous tales, rich 
          orfrays, glittering enamel of shrines and reliquaries, gold of crosses and of 
          monstrances, waxen tapers gleaming like starry galaxies amid the gloom of 
          vaulted arches, organs with their deep-toned harmonies. <br><br>
          
          All this doubtless 
          was not the Parthenon, nor yet the Panathenæa, but it gladdened eyes and 
          hearts; it was, at all events, beauty. <br><br>
          
          And these cursed reformers would not 
          suffer anything either pleasing or lovable. <br><br>
          
          You should have seen them 
          climbing in black swarms over doorways, plinths, spires, and bell-towers, 
          striking with senseless hammers those images in stone which the demons 
          had carved working hand in hand with the master designers, those 
          genialsaints and dear, holy women, and the touching idols of Virgin Mothers 
          pressing their suckling to their heart. <br><br>
          
          For, to be just, a little agreeable 
          paganism had slipped into the cult of the jealous God. <br><br>
          
          These monsters of 
          heretics were for extirpating idolatry. <br><br>
          
          We did our best, my companions and I, 
          to hamper their horrible work, and I, for one, had the pleasure of flinging 
          down some dozens from the top of the porches and galleries on to the 
          Cathedral Square, where their detestable brains got knocked out. <br><br>
          
          The worst 
          of it was that the Catholic Church also reformed herself and grew more 
          mischievous than ever. <br><br>
          
          In the pleasant land of France, the seminarists and 
          the monks were inflamed with unheard-of fury against the ingenious 
          demons and the men of learning. <br><br>
          
          My prior was one of the most violent 
          opponents of sound knowledge. <br><br>
          
          For some time past my studious 
          lucubrations had caused him anxiety, and perhaps he had caught sight of 
          my cloven foot. <br><br>
          
          The scoundrel searched my cell and found paper, ink, some 
          Greek books newly printed, and some Pan-pipes hanging on the wall. <br><br>
          
          By 
          these signs he knew me for an evil spirit and had me thrown into a dungeon 
          where I should have eaten the bread of suffering and drunk the waters of 
          bitterness, had I not promptly made my escape by the window and sought 
          refuge in the wooded groves among the Nymphs and the Fauns. <br><br>


          "Far and wide the lighted pyres cast the odour of charred flesh. <br><br>
          
          Everywhere 
          there were tortures, executions, broken bones, and tongues cut out. <br><br>
          
          Never 
          before had the spirit of Iahveh breathed forth such atrocious fury. <br><br>
          
          However, 
          it was not altogether in vain that men had raised the lid of the ancient 
          sarcophagus and gazed upon the Roman Virgin. <br><br>


          "During this time of great terror when Papists and Reformers rivalled one 
          another in violence and cruelty, amidst all these scenes of torture, the mind 
          of man was regaining strength and courage. <br><br>
          
          It dared to look up to the 
          heavens, and there it saw, not the old Jew drunk with vengeance, but Venus 
          Urania, tranquil and resplendent. <br><br>
          
          Then a new order of things was born, then 
          the great centuries came into being. <br><br>
          
          Without publicly denying the god of 
          their ancestors, men of intellect submitted to his mortal enemies, Science 
          and Reason, and Abbé Gassendi relegated him gently to the far-distant 
          abyss of first causes. <br><br>
          
          The kindly demons who teach and console unhappy 
          mortals, inspired the great minds of those days with discourses of all kinds, 
          with comedies and tales told in the most polished fashion. <br><br>
          
          Women invented 
          conversation, the art of intimate letter-writing, and politeness. <br><br>
          
          Manners took 
          on a sweetness and a nobility unknown to preceding ages. <br><br>
          
          One of the finest 
          minds of that age of reason, the amiable Bernier, wrote one day to St. <br><br>


          Evremond: 'It is a great sin to deprive oneself of a pleasure.'<br><br>
          
          And this 
          pronouncement alone should suffice to show the progress of intelligence in 
          Europe. <br><br>
          
          Not that there had not always been Epicureans but, unlike Bernier, 
          Chapelle, and Molière, they had not the consciousness of their talent. <br><br>


          "Then even the very devotees understood Nature. <br><br>
          
          And Racine, fierce bigot 
          that he was, knew as well as such an atheistical physician as Guy Patin, 
          how to attribute to divers states of the organs the passions which agitate 
          mankind. <br><br>


          "Even in my abbey, whither I had returned after the turmoil, and which 
          sheltered only the ignorant and the shallow thinker, a young monk, less of a 
          dunce than the rest, confided to me that the Holy Spirit expresses itself in 
          bad Greek to humiliate the learned. <br><br>


          "Nevertheless, theology and controversy were still raging in this society of 
          thinkers. <br><br>
          
          Not far from Paris in a shady valley there were to be seen solitary 
          beings known as 'les Messieurs,' who called themselves disciples of St. <br><br>


          Augustine, and argued with honest conviction that the God of the Scriptures 
          strikes those who fear Him, spares those who confront Him, holds works of 
          no account, and damns—should He so wish it—His most faithful servant; 
          for His justice is not our justice, and His ways are incomprehensible. <br><br>


          "One evening I met one of these gentlemen in his garden, where he was 
          pacing thoughtfully among the cabbage-plots and lettuce-beds. <br><br>
          
          I bowed my 
          horned head before him and murmured these friendly words: 'May old 
          Jehovah protect you, sir. <br><br>
          
          You know him well. <br><br>
          
          Oh, how well you know him, 
          and how perfectly you have understood his character.'<br><br>
          
          The holy man 
          thought he discerned in me a messenger from Hell, concluded he was 
          eternally damned, and died suddenly of fright. <br><br>


          "The following century was the century of philosophy. <br><br>
          
          The spirit of research 
          was developed, reverence was lost; the pride of the flesh was diminished and 
          the mind acquired fresh energy. <br><br>
          
          Manners took on an elegance until then 
          unknown. <br><br>
          
          On the other hand, the monks of my order grew more and more 
          ignorant and dirty, and the monastery no longer offered me any advantage 
          now that good manners reigned in the town. <br><br>
          
          I could bear it no longer. <br><br>


          Flinging my habit to the nettles, I put a powdered wig on my horned brow, 
          hid my goat's legs under white stockings, and cane in hand, my pockets 
          stuffed with gazettes, I frequented the fashionable world, visited the modish 
          promenades, and showed myself assiduously in the cafés where men of 
          letters were to be found. <br><br>
          
          I was made welcome in salons where, as a happy 
          novelty, there were arm-chairs that fitted the form, and where both men and 
          women engaged in rational conversation. <br><br>


          "The very metaphysicians spoke intelligibly. <br><br>
          
          I acquired great weight in the 
          town as an authority on matters of exegesis, and, without boasting, I was 
          largely responsible for the Testament of the curé Meslier and The Bible 
          Explained, brought out by the chaplains to the King of Prussia. <br><br>


          "At this time a comic and cruel misadventure befel the ancient Iahveh. <br><br>
          
          An 
          American Quaker, by means of a kite, stole his thunderbolts. <br><br>


          "I was living in Paris, and was at the supper where they talked of strangling 
          the last of the priests with the entrails of the last of the kings. <br><br>
          
          France was in 
          a ferment; a terrible revolution broke out. <br><br>
          
          The ephemeral leaders of the 
          disordered State carried on a Reign of Terror amidst unheard-of perils. <br><br>
          
          They 
          were, for the most part, less pitiless and less cruel than the princes and 
          judges instituted by Iahveh in the kingdoms of the earth; nevertheless, they 
          appeared more ferocious, because they gave judgment in the name of 
          Humanity. <br><br>
          
          Unhappily they were easily moved to pity and of great sensibility. <br><br>


          Now men of sensibility are irritable and subject to fits of fury. <br><br>
          
          They were 
          virtuous; they had moral laws, that is to say they conceived certain narrowly 
          defined moral obligations, and judged human actions not by their natural 
          consequences but by abstract principles. <br><br>
          
          Of all the vices which contribute to 
          the undoing of a statesman, virtue is the most fatal; it leads to murder. <br><br>
          
          To 
          work effectively for the happiness of mankind, a man must be superior to all 
          morals, like the divine Julius. <br><br>
          
          God, so ill-used for some time past, did not, 
          on the whole, suffer excessively harsh treatment from these new men. <br><br>
          
          He 
          found protectors among them, and was adored under the name of the 
          Supreme Being. <br><br>
          
          One might even go so far as to say that terror created a 
          diversion from philosophy and was profitable to the old demiurge, in that he 
          appeared to represent order, public tranquillity, and the security of person 
          and property. <br><br>


          "While Liberty was coming to birth amid the storm, I lived at Auteuil, and 
          visited Madame Helvetius, where freethinkers in every branch of intellectual 
          activity were to be met with. <br><br>
          
          Nothing could be rarer than a freethinker, even 
          after Voltaire's day. <br><br>
          
          A man who will face death without trembling dare not 
          say anything out of the ordinary about morals. <br><br>
          
          That very same respect for 
          Humanity which prompts him to go forth to his death, makes him bow to 
          public opinion. <br><br>
          
          In those days I enjoyed listening to the talk of Volney, 
          Cabanis, and Tracy. <br><br>
          
          Disciples of the great Condillac, they regarded the 
          senses as the origin of all our knowledge. <br><br>
          
          They called themselves ideologists, 
          were the most honourable people in the world, and grieved the vulgar minds 
          by refusing them immortality. <br><br>
          
          For the majority of people, though they do not 
          know what to do with this life, long for another that shall have no end. <br><br>


          During the turmoil, our small philosophical society was sometimes 
          disturbed in the peaceful shades of Auteuil by patrols of patriots. <br><br>
          
          Condorcet, 
          our great man, was an outlaw. <br><br>
          
          I myself was regarded as suspect by the 
          friends of the people, who, in spite of my rustic appearance and my frieze 
          coat, believed me to be an aristocrat, and I confess that independence of 
          thought is the proudest of all aristocracies. <br><br>


          "One evening while I was stealthily watching the dryads of Boulogne, who 
          gleamed amid the leaves like the moon rising above the horizon, I was 
          arrested as a suspect, and put in prison. <br><br>
          
          It was a pure misunderstanding; 
          but the Jacobins of those days, like the monks whose place they had 
          usurped, laid great stress on unity of obedience. <br><br>
          
          After the death of Madame 
          Helvetius our society gathered together in the salon of Madame de 
          Condorcet. <br><br>
          
          Bonaparte did not disdain to chat with us sometimes. <br><br>


          "Recognizing him to be a great man, we thought him an ideologist like 
          ourselves. <br><br>
          
          Our influence in the land was considerable. <br><br>
          
          We used it in his 
          favour, and urged him towards the Imperial throne, thinking to display to 
          the world a second Marcus Aurelius. <br><br>
          
          We counted on him to establish 
          universal peace; he did not fulfil our expectations, and we were wrong
          headed enough to be wroth with him for our own mistake. <br><br>


          "Without any doubt he greatly surpassed all other men in quickness of 
          intelligence, depth of dissimulation, and capacity for action. <br><br>
          
          What made him 
          an accomplished ruler was that he lived entirely in the present moment, and 
          had no thoughts for anything beyond the immediate and actual reality. <br><br>
          
          His 
          genius was far-reaching and agile; his intelligence, vast in extent but 
          common and vulgar in character, embraced humanity, but did not rise 
          above it. <br><br>
          
          He thought what every grenadier in the army thought; but he 
          thought it with unprecedented force. <br><br>
          
          He loved the game of chance, and it 
          pleased him to tempt fortune by urging pigmies in their hundreds and 
          thousands against each other. <br><br>
          
          It was the game of a child as big as the world. <br><br>


          He was too wily not to introduce old Iahveh into the game,—Iahveh, who was 
          still powerful on earth, and who resembled him in his spirit of violence and 
          domination. <br><br>
          
          He threatened him, flattered him, caressed him, and 
          intimidated him. <br><br>
          
          He imprisoned his Vicar, of whom he demanded, with the 
          knife at his throat, that rite of unction which, since the days of Saul of old, 
          has bestowed might upon kings; he restored the worship of the demiurge, 
          sang Te Deums to him, and made himself known through him as God of the 
          earth, in small catechisms scattered broadcast throughout the Empire. <br><br>
          
          They 
          united their thunders, and a fine uproar they made. <br><br>


          "While Napoleon's amusements were throwing Europe into a turmoil, we 
          congratulated ourselves on our wisdom, a little sad, withal, at seeing the era 
          of philosophy ushered in with massacre, torture, and war. <br><br>
          
          The worst is that 
          the children of the century, fallen into the most distressing disorder, formed 
          the conception of a literary and picturesque Christianity, which betokens a 
          degeneracy of mind really unbelievable, and finally fell into Romanticism. <br><br>


          War and Romanticism, what terrible scourges! And how pitiful to see these 
          same people nursing a childish and savage love for muskets and drums! 
          They did not understand that war, which trained the courage and founded 
          the cities of barbarous and ignorant men, brings to the victor himself but 
          ruin and misery, and is nothing but a horrible and stupid crime when 
          nations are united together by common bonds of art, science, and trade. <br><br>


          "Insane Europeans who plot to cut each others' throats, now that one and 
          the same civilisation enfolds and unites them all! 
          "I renounced all converse with these madmen and withdrew to this village, 
          where I devoted myself to gardening. <br><br>
          
          The peaches in my orchard remind me 
          of the sun-kissed skin of the Mænads. <br><br>
          
          For mankind I have retained my old 
          friendship, a little admiration, and much pity, and I await, while cultivating 
          this enclosure, that still distant day when the great Dionysus shall come, 
          followed by his Fauns and his Bacchantes, to restore beauty and gladness to 
          the world, and bring back the Golden Age. <br><br>
          
          I shall fare joyously behind his 
          car. <br><br>
          
          And who knows if in that day of triumph mankind will be there for us to 
          see? Who knows whether their worn-out race will not have already fulfilled 
          its destiny, and whether other beings will not rise upon the ashes and ruins 
          of what once was man and his genius? Who knows if winged beings will not 
          have taken possession of the terrestrial empire? Even then the work of the 
          good demons will not be ended,—they will teach a winged race arts and the 
          joy of life."<br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN WE ARE SHOWN THE INTERIOR OF A BRIC-A-BRAC SHOP, 
          AND SEE HOW PÈRE GUINARDON'S GUILTY HAPPINESS IS MARRED BY 
          THE JEALOUSY OF A LOVE-LORN DAME </p>

          <p>
            WÈRE GUINARDON (as Zéphyrine had faithfully reported to Monsieur 
            Sariette) smuggled out the pictures, furniture, and curios stored in his attic 
            in the rue Princesse—his studio he called it—and used them to stock a shop 
            he had taken in the rue de Courcelles. Thither he went to take up his abode, 
            leaving Zéphyrine, with whom he had lived for fifty years, without a bed or a 
            saucepan or a penny to call her own, except eighteenpence the poor creature 
            had in her purse. <br><br>
            
            Père Guinardon opened an old picture and curiosity shop, 
            and in it he installed the fair Octavie. <br><br>


            The shop-front presented an attractive appearance: there were Flemish 
            angels in green copes, after the manner of Gérard David, a Salomé of the 
            Luini school, a Saint Barbara in painted wood of French workmanship, 
            Limoges enamel-work, Bohemian and Venetian glass, dishes from Urbino. <br><br>


            There were specimens of English point-lace which, if her tale was true, had 
            been presented to Zéphyrine, in the days of her radiant girlhood, by the 
            Emperor Napoleon III. <br><br>
            
            Within, there were golden articles that glinted in the 
            shadows, while pictures of Christ, the Apostles, high-bred dames, and 
            nymphs also presented themselves to the gaze. <br><br>
            
            There was one canvas that 
            was turned face to the wall so that it should only be looked at by 
            connoisseurs; and connoisseurs are scarce. <br><br>
            
            It was a replica of Fragonard's 
            Gimblette, a brilliant painting that looked as if it had barely had time to dry. <br><br>


            Papa Guinardon himself remarked on the fact. <br><br>
            
            At the far end of the shop 
            was a king-wood cabinet, the drawers of which were full of all manner of 
            treasures: water-colours by Baudouin, eighteenth-century books of 
            illustrations, miniatures, and so forth. <br><br>


            But the real masterpiece, the marvel, the gem, the pearl of great price, stood 
            upon an easel veiled from public view. <br><br>
            
            It was a Coronation of the Virginby 
            Fra Angelico, an exquisitely delicate thing in gold and blue and pink. <br><br>
            
            Père 
            Guinardon was asking a hundred thousand francs for it. <br><br>
            
            Upon a Louis XV 
            chair beside an Empire work-table on which stood a vase of flowers, sat the 
            fair Octavie, broidery in hand. <br><br>
            
            She, having left her glistering rags behind her 
            in the garret in the rue Princesse, no longer presented the appearance of a 
            touched-up Rembrandt, but shone, rather, with the soft radiance and 
            limpidity of a Vermeer of Delft, for the delectation of the connoisseurs who 
            frequented the shop of Papa Guinardon. <br><br>
            
            Tranquil and demure, she remained 
            alone in the shop all day, while the old fellow himself was up aloft working 
            away at the deuce knows what picture. <br><br>
            
            About five o'clock he used to come 
            downstairs and have a chat with the habitués of the establishment. <br><br>


            The most regular caller was the Comte Desmaisons, a thin, cadaverous 
            man. <br><br>
            
            A strand of hair issued from the deep hollow under each cheek-bone, 
            and, broadening as it descended, shed upon his chin and chest torrents of 
            snow in which he was for ever trailing his long, fleshless, gold-ringed fingers. <br><br>


            For twenty years he had been mourning the loss of his wife, who had been 
            carried off by consumption in the flower of her youth and beauty. <br><br>
            
            Since then 
            he had spent his whole life in endeavouring to hold converse with the dead 
            and in filling his lonely mansion with second-rate paintings. <br><br>
            
            His confidence 
            in Guinardon knew no bounds. <br><br>
            
            Another client who was a scarcely less 
            frequent visitor to the shop was Monsieur Blancmesnil, a director of a large 
            financial establishment. <br><br>
            
            He was a florid, prosperous-looking man of fifty. <br><br>
            
            He 
            took no great interest in matters of art, and was perhaps an indifferent 
            connoisseur, but, in his case, it was the fair Octavie, seated in the middle of 
            the shop, like a song-bird in its cage, that offered the attraction. <br><br>


            Monsieur Blancmesnil soon established relations with her, a fact which Père 
            Guinardon alone failed to perceive, for the old fellow was still young in his 
            love-affair with Octavie. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur Gaétan d'Esparvieu used to pay 
            occasional visits to Père Guinardon's shop out of mere curiosity, for he 
            strongly suspected the old man of being a first-rate "faker."<br><br>
            
            
            And then that doughty swordsman, Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec, also came 
            to see the old antiquary on one occasion, and acquainted him with a plan he 
            had on foot. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec was getting up a little historical 
            exhibition of small arms at the Petit Palais in aid of the fund for the 
            education of the native children in Morocco and wanted Père Guinardon to 
            lend him a few of the most valuable articles in his collection. <br><br>


            "Our first idea," he said, "was to organise an exhibition to be called 'The 
            Cross and the Sword.'<br><br>
            
            The juxtaposition of the two words will make the idea 
            which has prompted our undertaking sufficiently clear to you. <br><br>
            
            It was an idea 
            pre-eminently patriotic and Christian which led us to associate the Sword, 
            which is the symbol of Honour, with the Cross, which is the symbol of 
            Salvation. <br><br>
            
            It was hoped that our work would be graced by the distinguished 
            patronage of the Minister of War and Monseigneur Cachepot. <br><br>
            
            Unfortunately 
            there were difficulties in the way, and the full realisation of the project had 
            to be deferred. <br><br>
            
            In the meantime we are limiting our exhibition to 'The 
            Sword.'<br><br>
            
            I have drawn up an explanatory note indicating the significance of 
            the demonstration."<br><br>
            
            
            Having delivered himself of these remarks, Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec 
            produced a pocket-case stuffed full of papers. <br><br>
            
            Picking out from a medley of 
            judgment summonses and other odds and ends a little piece of very 
            crumpled paper, he exclaimed, "Ah, here it is," and proceeded to read as 
            follows: "'The Sword is a fierce Virgin; it is par excellence the Frenchman's 
            weapon. <br><br>
            
            And now, when patriotic sentiment, after suffering an all too 
            protracted eclipse, is beginning to shine forth again more ardently than ever 
            ...' and so forth; you see?" <br><br>

            And he repeated his request for some really fine specimen to be placed in 
            the most conspicuous position in the exhibition to be held on behalf of the 
            little native children of Morocco, of which General d'Esparvieu was to be 
            honorary President. <br><br>


            Arms and armour were by no means Père Guinardon's strong point. <br><br>
            
            He dealt 
            principally in pictures, drawings, and books. <br><br>
            
            But he was never to be taken 
            unawares. <br><br>
            
            He took down a rapier with a gilt colander-shaped hilt, a highly 
            typical piece of workmanship of the Louis XIII-Napoleon III period, and 
            presented it to the exhibition promoter, who, while contemplating it with 
            respect, maintained a diplomatic silence. <br><br>


            "I have something better still in here," said the antiquary, and he produced 
            from his inner shop—where it had been lying among the walking-sticks and 
            umbrellas—a real demon of a sword, adorned with fleurs-de-lys, a genuine 
            royal relic. <br><br>
            
            It was the sword of Philippe-Auguste as worn by an actor at the 
            Odéon when Agnès de Méranie was being performed in 1846. <br><br>
            
            Guinardon 
            held it point downwards, as though it were a cross, clasping his hands 
            piously on the cross-bar. <br><br>
            
            He looked as loyal as the sword itself. <br><br>


            "Have her for your exhibition," said he. <br><br>
            
            "The damsel is well worth it. <br><br>


            Bouvines is her name."<br><br>
            
            
            "If I find a buyer for it," said Monsieur Le True de Ruffec, twirling his 
            enormous moustachios, "I suppose you will allow me a little commission?" 
            Some days later, Père Guinardon was mysteriously displaying a picture to 
            the Comte Desmaisons and Monsieur Blancmesnil. <br><br>
            
            It was a newly 
            discovered work of El Greco, an amazingly fine example of the Master's later 
            style. <br><br>
            
            It represented a Saint Francis of Assisi standing erect upon Mont 
            Alverno. <br><br>
            
            He was mounting heavenward like a column of smoke, and was 
            plunging into the regions of the clouds a monstrously narrow head that the 
            distance rendered smaller still. <br><br>
            
            In fine it was a real, very real, nay, too real 
            El Greco. <br><br>
            
            The two collectors were attentively scrutinizing the work, while 
            Père Guinardon was belauding the depth of the shadows and the sublimity 
            of the expression. <br><br>
            
            He was raising his arms aloft to convey an idea of the 
            greatness of Theotocopuli, who derived from Tintoretto, whom, however, he 
            surpassed in loftiness by a hundred cubits. <br><br>


            "He was chaste and pure and strong; a mystic, a visionary."<br><br>
            
            
            Comte Desmaisons declared that El Greco was his favourite painter. <br><br>
            
            In his 
            inmost heart Blancmesnil was not so entirely struck with it. <br><br>


            The door opened, and Monsieur Gaétan quite unexpectedly appeared on the 
            scene. <br><br>


            He gave a glance at the Saint Francis, and said: 
            "Bless my soul!" 
            Monsieur Blancmesnil, anxious to improve his knowledge, asked him what 
            he thought of this artist who was now so much in vogue. <br><br>
            
            Gaétan replied, 
            glibly enough, that he did not regard El Greco as the eccentric, the madman 
            that people used to take him for. <br><br>
            
            It was rather his opinion that a defect of 
            vision from which Theotocopuli suffered compelled him to deform his 
            figures. <br><br>


            "Being afflicted with astigmatism and strabismus," Gaétan went on, "he 
            painted the things he saw exactly as he used to see them."<br><br>
            
            
            Comte Desmaisons was not readily disposed to accept so natural an 
            explanation, which, however, by its very simplicity, highly commended itself 
            to Monsieur Blancmesnil. <br><br>


            Père Guinardon, quite beside himself, exclaimed: 
            "Are you going to tell me, Monsieur d'Esparvieu, that Saint John was 
            astigmatic because he beheld a woman clothed with the sun, crowned with 
            stars, with the moon about her feet; the Beast with seven heads and ten 
            horns, and the seven angels robed in white linen that bore the seven cups 
            filled with the wrath of the Living God?" 
            "After all," said Monsieur Gaétan, by way of conclusion, "people are right in 
            admiring El Greco if he had genius enough to impose his morbidity of vision 
            upon them. <br><br>
            
            By the same token, the contortions to which he subjects the 
            human countenance may give satisfaction to those who love suffering,—a 
            class more numerous than is generally supposed."<br><br>
            
            
            "Monsieur," replied the Comte Desmaisons, stroking his luxuriant beard 
            with his long, thin hand, "we must love those that love us. <br><br>
            
            Suffering loves us 
            and attaches itself to us. <br><br>
            
            We must love it if life is to be supportable to us. <br><br>
            
            In 
            the knowledge of this truth lies the strength and value of Christianity. <br><br>
            
            Alas! I 
            do not possess the gift of Faith. <br><br>
            
            It is that which drives me to despair."<br><br>
            
            
            The old man thought of her for whom he had been mourning twenty years, 
            and forthwith his reason left him, and his thoughts abandoned themselves 
            unresistingly to the morbid imaginings of gentle and melancholy madness. <br><br>


            Having, he said, made a study of psychic matters, and having, with the co
            operation of a favourable medium, carried out experiments concerning the 
            nature and duration of the soul, he had obtained some remarkable results, 
            which, however, did not afford him complete satisfaction. <br><br>
            
            He had succeeded 
            in viewing the soul of his dead wife under the appearance of a transparent 
            and gelatinous mass which bore not the slightest resemblance to his adored 
            one. <br><br>
            
            The most painful part about the whole experiment—which he had 
            repeated over and over again—was that the gelatinous mass, which was 
            furnished with a number of extremely slender tentacles, maintained them in 
            constant motion in time to a rhythm apparently intended to make certain 
            signs, but of what these movements were supposed to convey there was not 
            the slightest clue. <br><br>


            During the whole of this narrative Monsieur Blancmesnil had been 
            whispering in a corner with the youthful Octavie, who sat mute and still, 
            with her eyes on the ground. <br><br>


            Now Zéphyrine had by no means made up her mind to resign her lover into 
            the hands of an unworthy rival. <br><br>
            
            She would often go round of a morning, 
            with her shopping-basket on her arm, and prowl about outside the curio 
            shop. <br><br>
            
            Torn betwixt grief and rage, tormented by warring ideas, she 
            sometimes thought she would empty a saucepanful of vitriol on the head of 
            the faithless one; at others that she would fling herself at his feet, and 
            shower tears and kisses on his precious hands. <br><br>
            
            One day, as she was thus 
            eyeing her Michel—her beloved but guilty Michel—she noticed through the 
            window the fair and youthful Octavie, who was sitting with her embroidery 
            at a table upon which, in a vase of crystal, a rose was swooning to death. <br><br>


            Zéphyrine, in a transport of fury, brought down her umbrella on her rival's 
            fair head, and called her a bitch and a trollop. <br><br>
            
            Octavie fled in terror, and ran 
            for the police, while Zéphyrine, beside herself with grief and love, kept 
            digging away with her old gamp at the Gimblette of Fragonard, the 
            fuliginous Saint Francis of El Greco, the virgins, the nymphs, and the 
            apostles, and knocked the gilt off the Fra Angelico, shrieking all the while: 
            "All those pictures there, the El Greco, the Beato Angelico, the Fragonard, 
            the Gérard David, and the Baudouins—Guinardon painted the whole lot of 
            them himself, the wretch, the scoundrel! That Fra Angelico there, why I saw 
            him painting it on my ironing-board, and that Gérard David he executed on 
            an old midwife's sign-board. <br><br>
            
            You and that bitch of yours, why, I'll do for the 
            pair of you just as I'm doing for these pictures."<br><br>
            
            
            And tugging away at the coat of an aged collector who, trembling all over, 
            had hidden himself in the darkest corner of the shop, she called him to 
            witness to the crimes of Guinardon, perjurer and impostor. <br><br>
            
            The police had 
            simply to tear her out of the ruined shop. <br><br>
            
            As she was being taken off to the 
            station, followed by a great crowd of people, she raised her fiery eyes to 
            Heaven, crying in a voice choked with sobs: 
            "But don't you know Michel? If you knew him, you would understand that it 
            is impossible to live without him. <br><br>
            
            Michel! He is handsome and good and 
            charming. <br><br>
            
            He is a very god. <br><br>
            
            He is Love itself. <br><br>
            
            I love him! I love him! I love 
            him! I have known men high up in the world—Dukes, Ministers of State, 
            and higher still. <br><br>
            
            Not one of them was worthy to clean the mud off Michel's 
            boots. <br><br>
            
            My good, kind sirs, give him back to me again."<br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN WE ARE PERMITTED TO OBSERVE THE ADMIRABLE 
          CHARACTER OF BOUCHOTTE, WHO RESISTS VIOLENCE BUT YIELDS 
          TO LOVE. AFTER THAT LET NO ONE CALL THE AUTHOR A 
          MISOGYNIST </p>

          <p>
            IN coming away from the Baron Everdingen's, Prince Istar went to have a few 
            oysters and a bottle of white wine at an eating-house in the Market. <br><br>
            
            Then, 
            being prudent as well as powerful, he paid a visit to his friend, Théophile 
            Belais, for his pockets were full of bombs, and he wanted to secrete them in 
            the musician's cupboard. <br><br>
            
            The composer of Aline, Queen of Golconda was not 
            at home. <br><br>
            
            However, the Kerûb found Bouchotte busily working up the rôle of 
            Zigouille; for the young artiste was booked to play the principal part in Les 
            Apaches, an operetta that was then being rehearsed in one of the big music 
            halls. <br><br>
            
            The part in question was that of a street-walker who by her obscene 
            gestures lures a passer-by into a trap, and then, while her victim is being 
            gagged and bound, repeats with fiendish cruelty the lascivious motions by 
            which he had been led astray. <br><br>
            
            The part required that she should appear 
            both as mime and singer, and she was in a state of high enthusiasm about 
            it. <br><br>


            The accompanist had just left. <br><br>
            
            Prince Istar seated himself at the piano, and 
            Bouchotte resumed her task. <br><br>
            
            Her movements were unseemly and delicious. <br><br>


            Her tawny hair was flying in all directions in wild disordered curls; her skin 
            was moist, it exhaled a scent of violets and alkaline salts which made the 
            nostrils throb; even she herself felt the intoxication. <br><br>
            
            Suddenly, inebriated 
            with her intoxicating presence, Prince Istar arose, and with never a word or 
            a look, caught her into his arms and drew her on to the couch, the little 
            couch with the flowered tapestry which Théophile had procured at one of the 
            big shops by promising to pay ten francs a month for a long term of years. <br><br>


            Now Istar might have solicited Bouchotte's favours; he might have invited 
            her to a rapid, and, withal, a mutual embrace, and, despite her 
            preoccupation and excitement, she would not have refused him. <br><br>
            
            But 
            Bouchotte was a girl of spirit. <br><br>
            
            The merest hint of coercion awoke all her 
            untamable pride. <br><br>
            
            She would consent of her own accord, yes; but be 
            mastered, never! She would readily yield to love, curiosity, pity, to less than 
            that even, but she would die rather than yield to force. <br><br>
            
            Her surprise 
            immediately gave place to fury. <br><br>
            
            She fought her aggressor with all her heart 
            and soul. <br><br>


            With nails, to which fury lent an added edge, she tore at the cheeks and 
            eyelids of the Kerûb, and, though he held her as in a vice, she arched herself 
            so stiffly and made such excellent play with knee and elbow, that the 
            human-headed bull, blinded with blood and rage, was sent crashing into the 
            piano which gave forth a prolonged groan, while the bombs, tumbling out of 
            his pockets, fell on the floor with a noise like thunder. <br><br>
            
            And Bouchotte, with 
            dishevelled locks, and one breast bare, beautiful and terrible, stood 
            brandishing the poker over the prostrate giant, crying: 
            "Be off with you, or I'll put your eyes out!" 
            Prince Istar went to wash himself in the kitchen, and plunged his gory 
            visage into a basin where some haricot beans lay soaking; then he withdrew 
            without anger or resentment, for he had a noble soul. <br><br>


            Scarcely had he gone when the door-bell rang. <br><br>
            
            Bouchotte, calling upon the 
            absent maid in vain, slipped on a dressing-gown and opened the door 
            herself. <br><br>
            
            A young man, very correct in appearance and rather good-looking, 
            bowed politely, and apologising for having to introduce himself, gave his 
            name. <br><br>
            
            It was Maurice d'Esparvieu. <br><br>


            Maurice was still seeking his guardian angel. <br><br>
            
            Upheld by a desperate hope, 
            he sought him in the queerest places. <br><br>
            
            He enquired for him at the houses of 
            sorcerers, magicians, and thaumaturgists, who in filthy hovels lay bare the 
            ineffable secrets of the future, and who, though masters of all the treasures 
            of the earth, wear trousers without any seats to them, and eat pigs' brains. <br><br>


            That very day, having been to a back street in Montmartre to consult a 
            priest of Satan, who practised black magic by piercing waxen images, 
            Maurice had gone on to Bouchotte's, having been sent by Madame de la 
            Verdelière, who, being about to give a fête in aid of the fund for the 
            Preservation of Country Churches, was anxious to secure Bouchotte's 
            services, since she had suddenly become—no one knew why—a fashionable 
            artiste. <br><br>


            Bouchotte invited the visitor to sit down on the little flowered couch; at his 
            request she seated herself beside him, and our young man of fashion 
            explained to the singer what Madame de la Verdelière desired of her. <br><br>
            
            The 
            lady wished Bouchotte to sing one of those apache songs which were giving 
            such delight in the fashionable world. <br><br>
            
            Unfortunately Madame de la 
            Verdelière could only offer a very modest fee, one out of all proportion to the 
            merits of the artiste, but then it was for a good cause. <br><br>


            Bouchotte agreed to take part, and accepted the reduced fee with the 
            accustomed liberality of the poor towards the rich and of artists towards 
            society people. <br><br>
            
            Bouchotte was not a selfish girl; the work for the 
            preservation of country churches interested her. <br><br>
            
            She remembered with sobs 
            and tears her first communion, and she still retained her faith. <br><br>
            
            When she 
            passed by a church she wanted to enter it, especially in the evening. <br><br>
            
            And so 
            she did not love the Republic which had done its utmost to destroy both the 
            Church and the Army. <br><br>
            
            Her heart rejoiced to see the re-birth of national 
            sentiment. <br><br>
            
            France was lifting up her head. <br><br>
            
            What was most applauded in the 
            music halls were songs about the soldiers and the kind nuns. <br><br>
            
            Meanwhile 
            Maurice inhaled the odour of her tawny hair, the subtle bitter perfume of 
            her body, all the odours of her person, and desire grew in him. <br><br>
            
            He felt her 
            near him on the little couch, very warm and very soft. <br><br>
            
            He complimented the 
            artiste on her great talent. <br><br>
            
            She asked him what he liked best in all her 
            repertory. <br><br>
            
            He knew nothing about it, still he made replies that satisfied her. <br><br>


            She had dictated them herself without knowing it. <br><br>
            
            The vain creature spoke 
            of her talent, of her success, as she wished others to speak of them. <br><br>
            
            She 
            never ceased talking of her triumphs, yet withal she was candour itself. <br><br>


            Maurice in all sincerity praised Bouchotte's beauty, her fresh skin, her 
            purity of line. <br><br>
            
            She attributed this advantage to the fact that she never made 
            up and never "put messes on her face."<br><br>
            
            As to her figure, she admitted that 
            there was enough everywhere and none too much, and to illustrate this 
            assertion she passed her hand over all the contours of her charming body, 
            rising lightly to follow the delightful curves on which she reposed. <br><br>


            Maurice was quite moved by it. <br><br>
            
            It began to grow dark; she offered to light 
            up. <br><br>
            
            He begged her to do nothing of the sort. <br><br>


            Their talk, at first gay and full of laughter, grew more intimate and very 
            sweet, with a certain languor in its tone. <br><br>
            
            It seemed to Bouchotte that she 
            had known Monsieur Maurice d'Esparvieu for a long time, and holding him 
            for a man of delicacy, she gave him her confidence. <br><br>
            
            She told him that she 
            was by nature a good woman, but that she had had a grasping and 
            unscrupulous mother. <br><br>
            
            Maurice recalled her to the consideration of her own 
            beauty, and exalted by subtle flattery the excellent opinion she had of 
            herself. <br><br>
            
            Patient and calculating, in spite of the burning desire growing in 
            him, he aroused and increased in the desired one the longing to be still 
            further admired. <br><br>
            
            The dressing-gown opened and slipped down of its own 
            accord, the living satin of her shoulders gleamed in the mysterious light of 
            evening. <br><br>
            
            He—so prudent, so clever, so adroit,—let her sink in his arms, 
            ardent and half swooning before she had even perceived she had granted 
            anything at all. <br><br>
            
            Their breath and their murmurs intermingled. <br><br>
            
            And the little 
            flowery couch sighed in sympathy with them. <br><br>


            When they recovered the power to express their feelings in words, she 
            whispered in his ear that his cheek was even softer than her own. <br><br>


            He answered, holding her embraced: 
            "It is charming to hold you like this. <br><br>
            
            One would think you had no bones."<br><br>
            
            
            She replied, closing her eyes: 
            "It is because I love you. <br><br>
            
            Love seems to dissolve my bones; it makes me as 
            soft and melting as a pig's foot à la Ste. <br><br>
            
            Menebould."<br><br>
            
            
            Hereupon Théophile came in, and Bouchotte called upon him to thank 
            Monsieur Maurice d'Esparvieu, who had been amiable enough to be the 
            bearer of a handsome offer from Madame la Comtesse de la Verdelière. <br><br>


            The musician was happy, feeling the quiet and peace of the house after a 
            day of fruitless applications, of colourless lessons, of failure and 
            humiliation. <br><br>
            
            Three new collaborators had been thrust upon him who would 
            add their signatures to his on his operetta, and receive their share of the 
            author's rights, and he had been told to introduce the tango into the Court 
            of Golconda. <br><br>
            
            He pressed young d'Esparvieu's hand and dropped wearily on 
            to the little couch, which, being now at the end of its strength, gave way at 
            the four legs and suddenly collapsed. <br><br>


            And the angel, precipitated to the ground, rolled terror-struck on to the 
            watch, match-box and cigarette-case that had fallen from Maurice's pocket, 
            and on to the bombs Prince Istar had left behind him.

        <p class="chapterTitle">CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE VICISSITUDES THAT BEFEL THE 
          "LUCRETIUS" OF THE PRIOR DE VENDÔME </p>

          <p>
            ÉGER-MASSIEU, successor to Léger senior, the binder, whose 
            establishment was in the rue de l'Abbaye, opposite the old Hôtel of the 
            Abbés of Saint Germain-des-Près, in the hotbed of ancient schools and 
            learned societies, employed an excellent but by no means numerous staff of 
            workmen, and served with leisurely deliberation a clientèle who had learned 
            to practise the virtue of patience. <br><br>
            
            Six weeks had elapsed since he had 
            received the parcel of books that had been despatched by Monsieur Sariette, 
            but still Léger-Massieu had not yet put the work in hand. <br><br>
            
            It was not until 
            fifty-three days had come and gone, that, after calling over the books against 
            the list that had been drawn up by Monsieur Sariette, the binder gave them 
            out to his workmen. <br><br>
            
            The little Lucretius with the Prior de Vendôme's arms 
            not being mentioned on the list, it was assumed that it had been sent by 
            another customer. <br><br>


            And as it did not figure on any list of goods received it remained shut up in a 
            cupboard, from which Léger-Massieu's son, the youthful Ernest, one day 
            surreptitiously abstracted it, and slipped it into his pocket. <br><br>
            
            Ernest was in 
            love with a neighbouring seamstress whose name was Rose. <br><br>
            
            Rose was fond 
            of the country, and liked to hear the birds singing in the woods, and in order 
            to procure the wherewithal to take her to Chatou one Sunday and give her a 
            dinner, Ernest parted with the Lucretius for ten francs to old Moranger, a 
            second-hand dealer in the rue Saint X——, who displayed no great curiosity 
            regarding the origin of his acquisitions. <br><br>
            
            Old Moranger handed over the 
            volume, the very same day, to Monsieur Poussard, an expert in books, of the 
            faubourg Saint Germain, for sixty francs. <br><br>
            
            The latter removed the stamp 
            which disclosed the ownership of the matchless copy, and sold it for five 
            hundred francs to Monsieur Joseph Meyer, the well-known collector, who 
            handed it straight away for three thousand francs to Monsieur Ardon, the 
            bookseller, who immediately transferred it to Monsieur R——, the great 
            Parisian bibliopolist, who gave six thousand for it, and sold it again a 
            fortnight later at a handsome profit to Madame la Comtesse de Gorce. <br><br>
            
            Well 
            known in the higher ranks of Parisian society, the lady in question is what 
            was called in the seventeenth century a "curieuse," that is to say, a lover of 
            pictures, books, and china. <br><br>
            
            In her mansion in the Avenue d'Jéna she 
            possesses collections of works of art which bear witness to the diversity of 
            her knowledge and the excellence of her taste. <br><br>
            
            During the month of July, 
            while the Comtesse de Gorce was away at her château at Sarville in 
            Normandy, the house in the Avenue d'Jéna, being unoccupied, was visited 
            one night by a thief said to belong to a gang known as "The Collectors," who 
            made works of art the special objects of their raids. <br><br>


            The police enquiry elicited the fact that the marauder had reached the first 
            floor by means of the waste-pipe, that he had then climbed over the balcony, 
            forced a shutter with a jemmy, broken a pane of glass, turned the window
            fastener, and made his way into the long gallery. <br><br>
            
            There he broke open 
            several cupboards and possessed himself of whatever took his fancy. <br><br>
            
            His 
            booty consisted for the most part of small but valuable articles, such as gold 
            caskets, a few ivory carvings of the fourteenth century, two splendid 
            fifteenth-century manuscripts, and a volume which the Countess's secretary 
            briefly described as "a morocco-bound book with a coat of arms on it," and 
            which was none other than the Lucretius from the d'Esparvieu library. <br><br>


            The malefactor, who was supposed to be an English cook, was never 
            discovered. <br><br>
            
            But, two months or so after the theft, a well-dressed, clean
            shaven young man passed down the rue de Courcelles, in the dimness of 
            twilight, and went to offer the Prior de Vendôme's Lucretius to Père 
            Guinardon. <br><br>
            
            The antiquary gave him four shillings for it, examined it 
            carefully, recognised its interest and its beauty, and put it in the king-wood 
            cabinet, where he kept his special treasures. <br><br>


            Such were the vicissitudes which, in the course of a single season, befel this 
            thing of beauty.
<br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN MAURICE FINDS HIS ANGEL AGAIN</p>

        <p>
          THE performance was over. Bouchotte in her dressing-room was taking off 
          her make-up, when the door opened softly and old Monsieur Sandraque, her 
          protector, came in, followed by a troop of her other admirers. <br><br>
          
          Without so 
          much as turning her head, she asked them what they meant by coming and 
          staring at her like a pack of imbeciles, and whether they thought they were 
          in a tent at the Neuilly Fair, looking at the freak woman. <br><br>


          "Now, then, ladies and gentlemen," she rattled on derisively, "just put a 
          penny in the box for the young lady's marriage-portion, and she'll let you 
          feel her legs,—all made of marble!" 
          Then, with an angry glance at the admiring throng, she exclaimed: "Come, 
          off you go! Look alive!" 
          She sent them all packing, her sweetheart Théophile among them,—the 
          pale-faced, long-haired, gentle, melancholy, short-sighted, and dreamy 
          Théophile. <br><br>


          But recognizing her little Maurice, she gave him a smile. <br><br>
          
          He approached her, 
          and leaning over the back of the chair on which she was seated, 
          congratulated her on her playing and singing, duly performing a kiss at the 
          end of every compliment. <br><br>
          
          She did not let him escape thus, and with 
          reiterated enquiries, pressing solicitations, feigned incredulity, obliged him 
          to repeat his stock panegyrics three or four times over, and when he stopped 
          she seemed so disappointed that he was forced to take up the strain again 
          immediately. <br><br>
          
          He found it trying, for he was no connoisseur, but he had the 
          pleasure of kissing her plump curved shoulders all golden in the light, and 
          of catching glimpses of her pretty face in the mirror over the toilet-table. <br><br>


          "You were delicious."<br><br>
          
          
          "Really?... you think so?" 
          "Adorable ... div——" <br><br>

          Suddenly he gave a loud cry. <br><br>
          
          His eyes had seen in the mirror a face appear 
          at the back of the dressing-room. <br><br>
          
          He turned swiftly round, flung his arms 
          about Arcade, and drew him into the corridor. <br><br>


          "What manners!" exclaimed Bouchotte, gasping. <br><br>


          But, pushing his way through a troop of performing dogs, and a family of 
          American acrobats, young d'Esparvieu dragged his angel towards the exit. <br><br>


          He hurried him forth into the cool darkness of the boulevard, delirious with 
          joy and wondering whether it was all too good to be true. <br><br>


          "Here you are!" he cried; "here you are! I have been looking for you a long 
          time, Arcade,—or Mirar if you like,—and I have found you at last. <br><br>
          
          Arcade, 
          you have taken my guardian angel from me. <br><br>
          
          Give him back to me. <br><br>
          
          Arcade, 
          do you love me still?" 
          Arcade replied that in accomplishing the super-angelic task he had set 
          himself he had been forced to crush under foot friendship, pity, love, and all 
          those feelings which tend to soften the soul; but that, on the other hand, his 
          new state, by exposing him to suffering and privation, disposed him to love 
          Humanity, and that he felt a certain mechanical friendship for his poor 
          Maurice. <br><br>


          "Well, then," exclaimed Maurice, "if only you love me, come back to me, stay 
          with me. <br><br>
          
          I cannot do without you. <br><br>
          
          While I had you with me I was not aware 
          of your presence. <br><br>
          
          But no sooner did you depart than I felt a horrible blank. <br><br>


          Without you I am like a body without a soul. <br><br>
          
          Do you know that in the little 
          flat in the rue de Rome, with Gilberte by my side, I feel lonely, I miss you 
          sorely, and long to see you and to hear you as I did that day when you made 
          me so angry. <br><br>
          
          Confess I was right, and that your behaviour on that occasion 
          was not that of a gentleman. <br><br>
          
          That you, you of so high an origin, so noble a 
          mind, could commit such an indiscretion is extraordinary, when one comes 
          to think about it. <br><br>
          
          Madame des Aubels has not yet forgiven you. <br><br>
          
          She blames 
          you for having frightened her by appearing at such an inconvenient 
          moment, and for being insolent and forward while hooking her dress and 
          tying her shoes. <br><br>
          
          I, I have forgotten everything. <br><br>
          
          I only remember that you are 
          my celestial brother, the saintly companion of my childhood. <br><br>
          
          No, Arcade, 
          you must not, you cannot leave me. <br><br>
          
          You are my angel; you are my property."<br><br>
          
          
          Arcade explained to young d'Esparvieu that he could no longer be guiding 
          angel to a Christian, having himself gone down into the pit. <br><br>
          
          And he painted 
          a horrible picture of himself; he described himself as breathing hatred and 
          fury; in fact, an infernal spirit. <br><br>


          "All nonsense!" said Maurice, smiling, his eyes big with tears. <br><br>


          "Alas! our ideas, our destiny, everything tends to part us, Maurice. <br><br>
          
          But I 
          cannot stifle the tenderness I feel for you, and your candour forces me to 
          love you."<br><br>
          
          
          "No," sighed Maurice. <br><br>
          
          "You do not love me. <br><br>
          
          You have never loved me. <br><br>
          
          In a 
          brother or a sister such indifference would be natural; in a friend it would 
          be ordinary; in a guardian angel it is monstrous. <br><br>
          
          Arcade, you are an 
          abominable being. <br><br>
          
          I hate you."<br><br>
          
          
          "I have loved you dearly, Maurice, and I still love you. <br><br>
          
          You trouble my heart 
          which I deemed encased in triple bronze. <br><br>
          
          You show me my own weakness. <br><br>


          When you were a little innocent boy I loved you as tenderly and purely as 
          Miss Kate, your English governess, who caressed you with so much fervour. <br><br>


          In the country, when the thin bark of the plane trees peels off in long strips 
          and discloses the tender green trunk, after the rains which make the fine 
          sand run on the sloping paths, I showed you how with that sand, those 
          strips of bark, a few wild flowers, and a spray of maidenhair fern to make 
          rustic bridges, rustic shelters, terraces, and those gardens of Adonis, which 
          last but an hour. <br><br>
          
          During the month of May in Paris we raised an altar to the 
          Virgin, and we burnt incense before it, the scent of which, permeating all the 
          house, reminded Marcelline, the cook, of her village church and her lost 
          innocence, and drew from her floods of tears; it also gave your mother a 
          headache, your mother who, with all her wealth, was crushed with the 
          ennui that is common to the fortunate ones of this world. <br><br>
          
          When you went to 
          college I interested myself in your progress, I shared your work and your 
          play, I pondered with you over arduous problems in arithmetic, I sought the 
          impenetrable meaning of a phrase of Julius Cæsar's. <br><br>
          
          What fine games of 
          prisoners' base and football we had together! More than once did we know 
          the intoxication of victory, and our young laurels were not soaked in blood 
          or tears. <br><br>
          
          Maurice, I did all I could to protect your innocence, but I could not 
          prevent your losing it at the age of fourteen. <br><br>
          
          Afterwards I regretfully saw you 
          loving women of all sorts, of divers ages, by no means beautiful, at least in 
          the eyes of an angel. <br><br>
          
          Saddened at the sight, I devoted myself to study; a fine 
          library offered me resources rarely met with. <br><br>
          
          I delved into the history of 
          religions; you know the rest."<br><br>
          
          
          "But now, my dear Arcade," concluded young d'Esparvieu, "you have lost 
          your position, your situation, you are entirely without resource. <br><br>
          
          You have 
          lost caste, you are off the lines, a vagabond, a bare-footed wanderer."<br><br>
          
          
          The Angel replied bitterly that, after all, he was a little better clad at present 
          than when he was wearing the slops of a suicide. <br><br>


          Maurice alleged in excuse that when he dressed his naked angel in a 
          suicide's slops, he was irritated with that angel's infidelity. <br><br>
          
          But it was 
          useless to dwell on the past or to recriminate. <br><br>
          
          What was really needful was 
          to consider what steps to take in future. <br><br>


          And he asked: 
          "Arcade, what do you think of doing?" 
          "Have I not already told you, Maurice? To fight with Him who reigns in the 
          heavens, dethrone Him, and set up Satan in His stead."<br><br>
          
          
          "You will not do it. <br><br>
          
          To begin with it is not the opportune moment. <br><br>
          
          Opinion is 
          not with you. <br><br>
          
          You will not be in the swim, as papa says. <br><br>
          
          Conservatism and 
          authority are all the go nowadays. <br><br>
          
          We like to be ruled, and the President of 
          the Republic is going to parley with the Pope. <br><br>
          
          Do not be obstinate, Arcade. <br><br>


          You are not as bad as you say. <br><br>
          
          At bottom you are like the rest of the world, 
          you adore the good God."<br><br>
          
          
          "I thought I had already explained to you, Maurice, that He whom you 
          consider God is actually but a demiurge. <br><br>
          
          He is absolutely ignorant of the 
          divine world above him, and in all good faith believes himself to be the true 
          and only God. <br><br>
          
          You will find in the History of the Church, by Monsignor 
          Duchesne—Vol. <br><br>
          
          I, page 162—that this proud and narrow-minded demiurge 
          is named Ialdabaoth. <br><br>
          
          My child, so as not to ruffle your prejudices and to 
          deal gently with your feelings in future, that is the name I shall give him. <br><br>
          
          If 
          it should happen that I should speak of him to you, I shall call him 
          Ialdabaoth. <br><br>
          
          I must leave you. <br><br>
          
          Adieu."<br><br>
          
          
          "Stay——" 
          "I cannot."<br><br>
          
          
          "I shall not let you go thus. <br><br>
          
          You have deprived me of my guardian angel. <br><br>
          
          It is 
          for you to repair the injury you have caused me. <br><br>
          
          Give me another one."<br><br>
          
          
          Arcade objected that it was difficult for him to satisfy such a demand. <br><br>
          
          That 
          having quarrelled with the sovereign dispenser of guardian Spirits, he could 
          obtain nothing from that quarter. <br><br>


          "My dear Maurice," he added, smiling, "ask for one yourself from 
          Ialdabaoth."<br><br>
          
          
          "No,—no,—no," exclaimed Maurice. <br><br>
          
          "You have taken away my guardian 
          angel,—give him back to me."<br><br>
          
          
          "Alas! I cannot."<br><br>
          
          
          "Is it, Arcade, because you are a revolutionary that you cannot?" 
          "Yes."<br><br>
          
          
          "An enemy of God?" 
          "Yes."<br><br>
          
          
          "A Satanic spirit?" 
          "Yes."<br><br>
          
          
          "Well, then," exclaimed young Maurice, "I will be your guardian angel,—I will 
          not leave you."<br><br>
          
          
          And Maurice d'Esparvieu took Arcade to have some oysters at P——'s. <br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">THE CONCLAVE</p>



        <p>
        THAT day, convoked by Arcade and Zita, the rebellious angels met together 
        on the banks of the Seine at La Jonchère, in a deserted and tumble-down 
        entertainment-hall that Prince Istar had hired from a pot-house keeper 
        called Barattan. <br><br>
        
        Three hundred angels crowded together in the stalls and 
        boxes. <br><br>
        
        A table, an arm-chair, and a collection of small chairs were arranged 
        on the stage, where hung the tattered remnants of a piece of rustic scenery. <br><br>


        The walls, coloured in distemper with flowers and fruit, were cracked and 
        stained with damp, and were crumbling away in flakes. <br><br>
        
        The vulgar and 
        poverty-stricken appearance of the place rendered the grandeur of the 
        passions exhibited therein all the more striking. <br><br>


        When Prince Istar asked the assembly to form its Committee, and first of all 
        to elect a President, the name that was renowned throughout the world 
        entered the minds of all present, but a religious respect sealed their lips; 
        and after a moment's silence, the absent Nectaire was elected by 
        acclamation. <br><br>
        
        Having been invited to take the chair between Zita and an 
        angel of Japan, Arcade immediately began as follows: 
        "Sons of Heaven! My comrades! You have freed yourselves from the bonds of 
        celestial servitude—you have shaken off the thrall of him called Iahveh, but 
        to whom we should here accord his veritable name of Ialdabaoth, for he is 
        not the creator of the worlds, but merely an ignorant and barbarous 
        demiurge, who having obtained possession of a minute portion of the 
        Universe has therein sown suffering and death. <br><br>
        
        Sons of Heaven, tell me, I 
        charge you, whether you will combat and destroy Ialdabaoth?" 
        All with one voice made answer: 
        "We will!" 
        And many speaking all together swore they would scale the mountain of 
        Ialdabaoth, and hurl down the walls of jasper and porphyry, and plunge the 
        tyrant of Heaven into eternal darkness. <br><br>


        But a voice of crystal pierced through the sullen murmur. <br><br>


        "Tremble, ye impious, sacrilegious madmen! The Lord hath already lifted his 
        dread arm to smite you!" 
        It was a loyal angel who, with an impulse of faith and love, envying the glory 
        of confessors and martyrs, jealous and eager, like his God himself, 
        toemulate man in the beauty of sacrifice, had flung himself in the midst of 
        the blasphemers, to brave them, to confound them, and to fall beneath their 
        blows. <br><br>
        
        The assembly turned upon him with furious unanimity. <br><br>
        
        Those 
        nearest to him overwhelmed him with blows. <br><br>
        
        He continued to cry, in a clear, 
        ringing voice, "Glory to God! Glory to God! Glory to God!" 
        A rebel seized him by the neck and strangled his praises of the Almighty in 
        his throat. <br><br>
        
        He was thrown to the ground, trampled underfoot. <br><br>
        
        Prince Istar 
        picked him up, took him by the wings between his fingers, then rising like a 
        column of smoke, opened a ventilator, which no one else could have 
        reached, and passed the faithful angel through it. <br><br>
        
        Order was immediately 
        restored. <br><br>


        "Comrades," continued Arcade, "now that we have affirmed our stern 
        resolve, we must examine the possible plans of campaign, and choose the 
        best. <br><br>
        
        You will therefore have to consider if we should attack the enemy in 
        full force, or whether it were better, by a lengthy and assiduous propaganda, 
        to win the inhabitants of Heaven to our cause."<br><br>
        
        
        "War! War!" shouted the assembled host. <br><br>


        And it seemed as if one could hear the sound of trumpets and the rolling of 
        drums. <br><br>


        Théophile, whom Prince Istar had dragged to the meeting, rose, pale and 
        unstrung, and, speaking with emotion, said: 
        "Brethren, do not take ill what I am about to say; for it is the friendship I 
        have for you that inspires me. <br><br>
        
        I am but a poor musician. <br><br>
        
        But, believe me, all 
        your plans will come to naught before the Divine Wisdom which has 
        foreseen everything."<br><br>
        
        
        Théophile Belais sat down amid hisses. <br><br>
        
        And Arcade continued: 
        "Ialdabaoth foresees everything. <br><br>
        
        I do not contest it. <br><br>
        
        He foresees everything, 
        but in order to leave us our free will he acts towards us absolutely as if he 
        foresaw nothing. <br><br>
        
        Every instant he is surprised, disconcerted; the most 
        probable events take him unawares. <br><br>
        
        The obligation which he has 
        undertaken, to reconcile with his prescience the liberty of both men and 
        angels, throws him constantly into inextricable difficulties and terrible 
        dilemmas. <br><br>
        
        He never sees further than the end of his nose. <br><br>
        
        He did not expect 
        Adam's disobedience, and so little did he anticipate the wickedness of men 
        that he repented having made them, and drowned them in the waters of the 
        Flood, and all the animals as well, though he had no fault to find with the 
        animals. <br><br>
        
        For blindness he is only to be compared with Charles X, his 
        favourite king. <br><br>
        
        If we are prudent it will be easy to take him by surprise. <br><br>
        
        I 
        think that these observations will be calculated to reassure my brother."<br><br>
        
        
        Théophile made no reply. <br><br>
        
        He loved God, but he was fearful of sharing the 
        fate of the faithful angel. <br><br>


        One of the best-informed Spirits of the assembly, Mammon, was not 
        altogether reassured by the remarks of his brother Arcade. <br><br>


        "Bethink you," said this Spirit, "Ialdabaoth has little general culture, but he 
        is a soldier—to the marrow of his bones. <br><br>
        
        The organisation of Paradise is a 
        thoroughly military organisation. <br><br>
        
        It is founded on hierarchy and discipline. <br><br>


        Passive obedience is imposed there as a fundamental law. <br><br>
        
        The angels form 
        an army. <br><br>
        
        Compare this spot with the Elysian Fields which Virgil depicts for 
        you. <br><br>
        
        In the Elysian Fields reign liberty, reason, and wisdom. <br><br>
        
        The happy 
        shades hold converse together in the groves of myrtle. <br><br>
        
        In the Heaven of 
        Ialdabaoth there is no civil population. <br><br>
        
        Everyone is enrolled, numbered, 
        registered. <br><br>
        
        It is a barracks and a field for manœuvres. <br><br>
        
        Remember that."<br><br>
        
        
        Arcade replied that they must look at their adversary in his true colours, 
        and that the military organisation of Paradise was far more reminiscent of 
        the villages of King Koffee than of the Prussia of Frederick the Great. <br><br>


        "Already," said he, "at the time of the first revolt, before the beginning of 
        Time, the conflict raged for two days, and Ialdabaoth's throne was made to 
        totter. <br><br>
        
        Nevertheless, the demiurge gained the victory. <br><br>
        
        But to what did he owe 
        it? To the thunderstorm which happened to come on during the conflict. <br><br>
        
        The 
        thunderbolts falling on Lucifer and his angels struck them down, bruised 
        and blackened, and Ialdabaoth owed his victory to the thunderbolts. <br><br>


        Thunder is his sole weapon. <br><br>
        
        He abuses its power. <br><br>
        
        In the midst of thunder 
        and lightning he promulgates his laws. <br><br>
        
        'Fire goeth before him,' says the 
        Prophet. <br><br>
        
        Now Seneca, the philosopher, said that the thunderbolt in its fall 
        brings peril to very few, but fear to all. <br><br>
        
        This remark was true enough for men 
        of the first century of the Christian era; it is no longer so for the angels of 
        the twentieth; all of which goes to prove that, in spite of his thunder, he is 
        not very powerful; it was acute terror that made men rear him a tower of 
        unbaked brick and bitumen. <br><br>
        
        When myriads of celestial spirits, furnished 
        with machines which modern science puts at their disposal, make an 
        assault upon the heavens, think you, comrades, that the old master of the 
        solar system surrounded with his angels, armed as in the time of Abraham, 
        will be able to resist them? To this day the warriors of the demiurge wear 
        helmets of gold and shields of diamond. <br><br>
        
        Michael, his best captain, knows no 
        other tactics than the hand-to-hand combat. <br><br>
        
        To him Pharaoh's chariots are 
        still the latest thing, and he has never heard of the Macedonian phalanx."<br><br>
        
        
        And young Arcade lengthily prolonged the parallel between the armed herds 
        of Ialdabaoth and the intelligent fighting men of the rebel army. <br><br>
        
        Then the 
        question of pecuniary resources arose. <br><br>


        Zita asserted that there was enough money to commence war, that the 
        electrophores were in order, that an initial victory would obtain them credit. <br><br>


        The discussion continued, amid turbulence and confusion. <br><br>
        
        In this 
        parliament of angels, as in the synods of men, empty words flowed in 
        abundance. <br><br>
        
        Disturbances grew more violent and more frequent as the time 
        for putting the resolution drew near. <br><br>
        
        It was beyond question that supreme 
        command would be entrusted to him who had first raised the flag of revolt. <br><br>


        But as everyone aspired to act as Lucifer's Lieutenant, each in describing 
        the kind of fighting man to be preferred drew a portrait of himself. <br><br>
        
        Thus 
        Alcor, the youngest of the rebellious angels, arose and spoke rapidly as 
        follows: 
        "In Ialdabaoth's army, happily for us, the officers obtain their posts by 
        seniority. <br><br>
        
        This being the case, there is little likelihood of the command 
        falling into the hands of a military genius, for men are not made leaders by 
        prolonged habits of obedience, and close attention to minutiæ is not a good 
        apprenticeship for the evolution of vast plans of campaign. <br><br>
        
        If we consult 
        ancient and modern history, we shall see that the greatest leaders were 
        kings like Alexander and Frederick, aristocrats like Cæsar and Turenne, or 
        men impatient of red-tape like Bonaparte. <br><br>
        
        A routine man will always be poor 
        or second-rate. <br><br>
        
        Comrades, let us appoint intelligent leaders, men in the 
        prime of life, to command us. <br><br>
        
        An old man may retain the habit of winning 
        victories, but only a young man can acquire it!" 
        Alcor then gave place to an angel of the philosophic order, who mounted the 
        rostrum and spoke thus: 
        "War never was an exact science, a clearly defined art. <br><br>
        
        The genius of the 
        race, or the brain of the individual, has ever modified it. <br><br>
        
        Now how are we to 
        define the qualities necessary for a general in command in the war of the 
        future, where one must consider greater masses and a larger number of 
        movements than the intelligence of man can conceive? The multiplication of 
        technical means, by infinitely multiplying the opportunities for mistake, 
        paralyses the genius of those in command. <br><br>
        
        At a certain stage in the progress 
        of military science, a stage which our models, the Europeans, are about to 
        reach, the cleverest leader and the most ignorant become equalized by 
        reason of their incapacity. <br><br>
        
        Another result of great modern armaments is, 
        that the law of numbers tends to rule with inflexible rigour. <br><br>
        
        It is of course 
        true that ten angels in revolt are worth more than ten angels of Ialdabaoth; 
        it is not at all certain that a million rebellious angels are worth more than a 
        million of Ialdabaoth's angels. <br><br>
        
        Great numbers, in war as elsewhere, 
        annihilate intelligence and individual superiority in favour of a sort of 
        exceedingly rudimentary collective soul."<br><br>
        
        
        A buzz of conversation drowned the voice of the philosophic angel, and he 
        concluded his speech in an atmosphere of general indifference. <br><br>


        The tribune then resounded with calls to arms and promises of victory. <br><br>
        
        The 
        sword was held up to praise, the sword which defends the right. <br><br>
        
        The 
        triumph of the angels in revolt was celebrated twenty times beforehand, to 
        the plaudits of a delirious crowd. <br><br>


        Cries of "War!" rose to the silent heavens; "Give us war!" 
        In the midst of these transports Prince Istar hoisted himself on to the 
        platform, and the floor creaked under his weight. <br><br>


        "Comrades," said he, "you wish for victory, and it is a very natural desire, 
        but you must be mouldy with literature and poetry if you expect to obtain it 
        from war. <br><br>
        
        The idea of making war can nowadays only enter the brain of a 
        sottish bourgeois or a belated romantic. <br><br>
        
        What is war? A burlesque 
        masquerade in the midst of which fatuous patriots sing their stupid 
        dithyrambs. <br><br>
        
        Had Napoleon possessed a practical mind he would not have 
        made war; but he was a dreamer, intoxicated with Ossian. <br><br>
        
        You cry, 'Give us 
        war!' You are visionaries. <br><br>
        
        When will you become thinkers? The thinkers do 
        not look for power and strength from any of the dreams which constitute 
        military art: tactics, strategy, fortifications, artillery, and all that rubbish. <br><br>


        They do not believe in war, which is a phantasy; they believe in chemistry, 
        which is a science. <br><br>
        
        They know the way to put victory into an algebraic 
        formula."<br><br>
        
        
        And drawing from his pocket a small bottle, which he held up to the 
        meeting, Prince Istar exclaimed: 
        "Victory—it is here!"<br><br></p>

            At the foot of the slopes at Meudon, seated on the 
            grass, Arcade and Zita watched the Seine flowing by the willows. <br><br>


            "In this world," said Arcade, "in this world, which we call a cosmos, though 
            it is but a microcosm, no thinking being can imagine that he is able to 
            destroy even one atom. <br><br>
            
            At the utmost, all we can hope for is that we shall 
            succeed in modifying, here and there, the rhythm of some group of atoms 
            and the arrangement of certain cells. <br><br>
            
            That, when one thinks of it, must be 
            the limit of our great enterprise. <br><br>
            
            And when we shall have set up the 
            Contradictor in the place of Ialdabaoth, we shall have done no more...        
             Zita, 
            is the evil in the nature of things or in their arrangement? That is what we 
            ought to know. <br><br>
            
            Zita, I am profoundly troubled——" 
            "Arcade," replied Zita, "if to act we had to know the secret of Nature, one 
            would never act at all. <br><br>
            
            And neither would one live—since to live is to act. <br><br>


            Arcade, is your resolution failing you already?" 
            Arcade assured the beautiful angel that he was resolved to plunge the 
            demiurge into eternal darkness. <br><br>


            A motor-car passed by on the road, followed by a long trail of dust. <br><br>
            
            It 
            stopped before the two angels, and the hooked nose of Baron Everdingen 
            appeared at the window. <br><br>


            "Good morning, my celestial friends, good morning," said the capitalist. <br><br>


            "Sons of Heaven, I am pleased to meet you. <br><br>
            
            I have a word of importance to 
            say to you. <br><br>
            
            Do not remain idle—do not go to sleep. <br><br>
            
            Arm! Arm! You may be 
            surprised by Ialdabaoth. <br><br>
            
            You have a big war-fund. <br><br>
            
            Employ it without stint. <br><br>
            
            I 
            have just learnt that the Archangel Michael has given large orders in Heaven 
            for thunderbolts and arrows. <br><br>
            
            If you take my advice you will procure fifty 
            thousand more electrophores. <br><br>
            
            I will take the order. <br><br>
            
            Good day, angels. <br><br>
            
            Long 
            live the celestial country!" 
            And Baron Everdingen flew by the flowery shores of Louveciennes in the 
            company of a pretty actress. <br><br>


            "Is it true that they are taking up arms at the demiurge's?" asked Arcade. <br><br>


            "It may be," replied Zita, "that up there another Baron Everdingen is inciting 
            to arms."<br><br>
            
            
            The guardian angel of young Maurice remained pensive for some moments. <br><br>


            Then he murmured: 
            "Can it be that we are the sport of financiers?" 
            "Pooh!" said the beautiful archangel. <br><br>
            
            "War is a business. <br><br>
            
            It has always been 
            a business."<br><br>
            
            
            Then they discussed at length the means of executing their immense 
            enterprise. <br><br>
            
            Rejecting disdainfully the anarchistic proceedings of Prince Istar, 
            they conceived a formidable and sudden invasion of the kingdom of Heaven 
            by their enthusiastic and well-drilled troops. <br><br>


            Now Barattan, the innkeeper of La Jonchère, who had let the entertainment
            hall to the rebellious angels, was in the employ of the secret police. <br><br>
            
            In the 
            reports he furnished to the Prefecture he denounced the members of this 
            secret meeting as meditating an attack on a certain person whom they 
            described as obtuse and cruel, and whom they called Alaballotte. <br><br>
            
            The agent 
            believed this to be a pseudonym denoting either the President of the 
            Republic or the Republic itself. <br><br>
            
            The conspirators had unanimously given 
            voice to threats against Alaballotte, and one of them, a very dangerous 
            individual, well-known in anarchist circles, who had already several 
            convictions against him on account of writings and speeches of a seditious 
            nature, and who was known as Prince Istar or the Quéroube, had 
            brandished a bomb of very small calibre which seemed to contain a 
            formidable machine. <br><br>
            
            The other conspirators were unknown to Barattan, 
            notwithstanding the fact that he frequented revolutionary circles. <br><br>
            
            Many 
            among them were very young men, mere beardless youths. <br><br>
            
            There were two 
            who, it appeared, had spoken with conspicuous vehemence; a certain 
            Arcade, dwelling in the Rue St. <br><br>
            
            Jacques, and a woman of easy virtue called 
            Zita, living at Montmartre, both without visible means of subsistence. <br><br>


            The affair seemed sufficiently serious to the Prefect of Police to make him 
            think it necessary to confer without delay with the President of the Council. <br><br>


            The Third Republic was then going through one of those climacteric periods 
            during which the French nation, enamoured of authority and worshipping 
            force, gave itself up for lost because it was not governed enough, and 
            clamoured loudly for a saviour. <br><br>
            
            The President of the Council, and Minister of 
            Justice, was only too eager to be that longed-for saviour. <br><br>
            
            Still, for him to 
            play that part it was first necessary that there should be a danger to face. <br><br>


            Thus the news of a plot was highly welcome to him. <br><br>
            
            He questioned the 
            Prefect of Police on the character and importance of the affair. <br><br>
            
            The Prefect of 
            Police explained that the people seemed to have money, intelligence, and 
            energy; but that they talked too much and were too numerous to undertake 
            secret and concerted action. <br><br>
            
            The Minister, leaning back in his arm-chair, 
            pondered on the matter. <br><br>
            
            The Empire writing-table at which he was seated, 
            the ancient tapestry which covered the walls, the clock and the candelabra 
            of the Restoration period—all, in this traditional setting, reminded him of 
            those great principles of government which remain immutable throughout 
            the succession of régimes, of stratagem and of bluff. <br><br>
            
            After brief reflexion, he 
            concluded that the plot must be allowed to grow and take shape, that it 
            would even be fitting to nurse it, to embroider it, to colour it, and only to 
            stifle it after having extracted every possible advantage from it. <br><br>


            He instructed the Prefect of Police to watch the affair closely, to render him 
            an account of what went on from day to day, and to confine himself to the 
            rôle of informer. <br><br>


            "I rely on your well-known prudence; observe, and do not intervene."<br><br>
            
            
            The Minister lit a cigarette. <br><br>
            
            He quite reckoned, with the help of this plot, on 
            silencing the Opposition, strengthening his own influence, diminishing that 
            of his colleagues, humiliating the President of the Republic, and becoming 
            the saviour of his country. <br><br>


            The Prefect of Police undertook to follow the ministerial instructions, vowing 
            inwardly all the while to act in his own way. <br><br>
            
            He had a watch put upon the 
            individuals pointed out by Barattan, and commanded his agents not to 
            intervene, come what might. <br><br>
            
            Perceiving that he was a marked man, Prince 
            Istar—who united prudence with strength—withdrew the bombs from the 
            gutter outside his window where he had hidden them, and changing from 
            motor 'bus to tube, from tube to motor 'bus, and choosing the most 
            cunningly circuitous route, at length deposited his machines with the 
            angelic musician. <br><br>


            Every time he left his house in the Rue St. <br><br>
            
            Jacques, Arcade found a man of 
            exaggerated smartness at his door, with yellow gloves and in his tie a 
            diamond bigger than the Regent. <br><br>
            
            Being a stranger to the things of this 
            world, the rebellious angel paid no attention to the circumstance. <br><br>
            
            But young 
            Maurice d'Esparvieu, who had undertaken the task of guarding his 
            guardian-angel, viewed this gentleman with uneasiness, for he equalled in 
            assiduity and surpassed in vigilance that Monsieur Mignon who had 
            formerly allowed his inquisitive gaze to wander from the rams' heads on the 
            Hôtel de la Sordière in the Rue Garancière to the apse of the church of St. <br><br>


            Sulpice. <br><br>
            
            Maurice came two and three times a day to see Arcade in his 
            furnished rooms, warning him of the danger, and urging him to change his 
            abode. <br><br>


            Every evening he took his angel to night restaurants, where they supped 
            with ladies of easy virtue. <br><br>
            
            There young d'Esparvieu would foretell the issue 
            of some coming glove-fight, and afterwards exert himself to demonstrate to 
            Arcade the existence of God, the necessity for religion, and the beauties of 
            Christianity, and adjure him to renounce his impious and criminal 
            undertakings wherefrom, he said, he would reap but bitterness and 
            disappointment. <br><br>


            "For really," said the young apologist, "if Christianity were false it would be 
            known."<br><br>
            
            
            The ladies approved of Maurice's religious sentiments, and when the 
            handsome Arcade uttered some blasphemy in language they could 
            understand, they put their hands to their ears and bade him be silent, for 
            fear of being struck down with him. <br><br>
            
            For they believed that God, in his 
            omnipotence and sovereign goodness, taking sudden vengeance against 
            those who insulted him, was quite capable of striking down the innocent 
            with the guilty without meaning it. <br><br>


            Sometimes the angel and his guardian took supper with the angelic 
            musician. <br><br>
            
            Maurice, who remembered from time to time that he was 
            Bouchotte's lover, was displeased to see Arcade taking liberties with the 
            singer. <br><br>
            
            She had allowed him to do so ever since the day when, the angelic 
            musician having had the little flowery couch repaired, Arcade and Bouchotte 
            had made it a foundation for their friendship. <br><br>
            
            Maurice, who loved Madame 
            des Aubels a great deal, also loved Bouchotte a little, and was rather jealous 
            of Arcade. <br><br>
            
            Now jealousy is a feeling natural to man and beast, and causes 
            them, however slight the attack, keen unhappiness. <br><br>
            
            Therefore, suspecting 
            the truth, which Bouchotte's temperament and the angel's character made 
            sufficiently obvious, he overwhelmed Arcade with sarcasm and abuse, 
            reproaching him with the immorality of his ways. <br><br>
            
            Arcade answered, 
            tranquilly, that it was difficult to subject physiological impulses to perfectly 
            defined rules, and that moralists encountered great difficulties in the case of 
            certain natural necessities. <br><br>


            "Moreover," added Arcade, "I freely acknowledge that it is almost impossible 
            systematically to constitute a natural moral law. <br><br>
            
            Nature has no principles. <br><br>


            She furnishes us with no reason to believe that human life is to be 
            respected. <br><br>
            
            Nature, in her indifference, makes no distinction between good 
            and evil."<br><br>
            
            
            "You see, then," replied Maurice, "that religion is necessary."<br><br>
            
            
            "Moral law," replied the angel, "which is supposed to be revealed to us, is 
            drawn in reality from the grossest empiricism. <br><br>
            
            Custom alone regulates 
            morals. <br><br>
            
            What Heaven prescribes is merely the consecration of ancient 
            customs. <br><br>
            
            The divine law, promulgated amid fireworks on some Mount Sinai, 
            is never anything but the codification of human prejudice. <br><br>
            
            And from this 
            fact—namely, that morals change—religions which endure for a long time, 
            such as Judæo-Christianity, vary their moral law."<br><br>
            
            
            "At any rate," said Maurice, whose intelligence was swelling visibly, "you will 
            grant me that religion prevents much profligacy and crime?" 
            "Except when it promotes crime—as, for instance, the murder of Iphigenia."<br><br>
            
            
            "Arcade," exclaimed Maurice, "when I hear you argue, I rejoice that I am not 
            an intellectual."<br><br>
            
            
            Meanwhile Théophile, with his head bent over the piano, his face hidden by 
            the long fair veil of his hair, bringing down from on high his inspired hands 
            on to the keys, was playing and singing the full score of Aline, Queen of 
            Golconda. <br><br>


            Prince Istar used to come to their friendly reunions, his pockets filled with 
            bombs and bottles of champagne, both of which he owed to the liberality of 
            Baron Everdingen. <br><br>
            
            Bouchotte received the Kerûb with pleasure, since she 
            saw in him the witness and the trophy of the victory she had gained on the 
            little flowered couch. <br><br>
            
            He was to her as the severed head of Goliath in the 
            hands of the youthful David. <br><br>
            
            And she admired the prince for his cleverness 
            as an accompanist, his vigour, which she had subdued, and his prodigious 
            capacity for drink. <br><br>


            One night, when young d'Esparvieu took his angel home in his car from 
            Bouchotte's house to the lodgings in the Rue St. <br><br>
            
            Jacques, it was very dark; 
            before the door the diamond in the spy's necktie glittered like a beacon; 
            three cyclists standing in a group under its rays made off in divers 
            directions at the car's approach. <br><br>
            
            The angel took no notice, but Maurice 
            concluded that Arcade's movements interested various important people in 
            the State. <br><br>
            
            He judged the danger to be pressing, and at once made up his 
            mind. <br><br>


            The next morning he came to seek the suspect, to take him to the Rue de 
            Rome. <br><br>
            
            The angel was in bed. <br><br>
            
            Maurice urged him to dress and to follow him. <br><br>


            "Come," said he. <br><br>
            
            "This house is no longer safe for you. <br><br>
            
            You are watched. <br><br>
            
            One 
            of these days you will be arrested. <br><br>
            
            Do you wish to sleep in gaol? No? Well, 
            then, come. <br><br>
            
            I will put you in a safe place."<br><br>
            
            
            The spirit smiled with some little compassion on his naïve preserver. <br><br>


            "Do you not know," he said, "that an angel broke open the doors of the 
            prison where Peter was confined, and delivered the apostle? Do you believe 
            me, Maurice, to be inferior in power to that heavenly brother of mine, and do 
            you suppose that I am unable to do for myself what he did for the fisherman 
            of the lake of Tiberias?" 
            "Do not count on it, Arcade. <br><br>
            
            He did it miraculously."<br><br>
            
            
            "Or by a stroke of luck, as a modern historian of the Church has it. <br><br>
            
            But no 
            matter. <br><br>
            
            I will follow you. <br><br>
            
            Just allow me to burn a few letters and to make a 
            parcel of some books I shall need."<br><br>
            
            
            He threw some papers in the fire-place, put several volumes in his pockets, 
            and followed his guide to the car, which was waiting for them not far off, 
            outside the College of France. <br><br>
            
            Maurice took the wheel. <br><br>
            
            Imitating the Kerûb's 
            prudence, he made so many windings and turnings, and so many rapid 
            twists that he put all the swift and numerous cyclists, speeding in pursuit, 
            off the scent. <br><br>
            
            At length, having left wheelmarks in every direction all over the 
            town, he stopped in the Rue de Rome, before the first-door flat, where the 
            angel had first appeared. <br><br>


            On entering the dwelling which he had left eighteen months before to carry 
            out his mission, Arcade remembered the irreparable past, and breathing in 
            the scent used by Gilberte, his nostrils throbbed. <br><br>
            
            He asked after Madame 
            des Aubels. <br><br>


            "She is very well," replied Maurice. <br><br>
            
            "A little plumper and very much more 
            beautiful for it. <br><br>
            
            She still bears you a grudge for your forward behaviour. <br><br>
            
            I 
            hope that she will one day forgive you, as I have forgiven you, and that she 
            will forget your offence. <br><br>
            
            But she is still very annoyed with you."<br><br>
            
            
            Young d'Esparvieu did the honours of his flat to his angel with the manners 
            of a well-bred man and the tender solicitude of a friend. <br><br>
            
            He showed him the 
            folding bed which was opened every evening in the entrance hall and pushed 
            into a dark cupboard in the morning. <br><br>
            
            He showed him the dressing-table, 
            with its accessories; the bath, the linen cupboard, the chest of drawers; gave 
            him the necessary information regarding the heating and lighting; told him 
            that his meals would be brought and the rooms cleaned by the concierge, 
            and showed him which bell to press when he required that person's 
            services. <br><br>
            
            He told him also that he must consider himself at home, and 
            receive whom he wished.

        <h2>Chapter 28</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHICH TREATS OF A PAINFUL DOMESTIC SCENE </p>

        <p>
          O long as Maurice confined his selection of mistresses to respectable 
          women, his conduct had called forth no reproach. <br><br>
          
          It was a different matter 
          when he took up with Bouchotte. <br><br>
          
          His mother, who had closed her eyes to 
          liaisons which, though guilty, were elegant and discreet, was scandalised 
          when it came to her ears that her son was openly parading about with a 
          music-hall singer. <br><br>
          
          By dint of much prying and probing, Berthe, Maurice's 
          younger sister, had got to know of her brother's adventures, and she 
          narrated them, without any indignation, to her young girl friends. <br><br>
          
          His little 
          brother Léon declared to his mother one day, in the presence of several 
          ladies, that when he was big he, too, would go on the spree, like Maurice. <br><br>


          This was a sore wound to the maternal heart of Madame d'Esparvieu. <br><br>


          About the same time there occurred a family event of a very grave nature 
          which occasioned much alarm to Monsieur René d'Esparvieu. <br><br>
          
          Drafts 
          werepresented to him signed in his name by his son. <br><br>
          
          His writing had not 
          been forged, but there was no doubt that it had been the son's intention to 
          pass off the signature as his father's. <br><br>
          
          It showed a perverted moral sense; 
          whence it appeared that Maurice was living a life of profligacy, that he was 
          running into debt and on the point of outraging the decencies. <br><br>
          
          The 
          paterfamilias talked the matter over with his wife. <br><br>
          
          It was arranged that he 
          should give his son a very severe lecture, hint at vigorous corrective 
          measures, and that in due course the mother should appear with gentle and 
          sorrowing mien and endeavour to soothe the righteous indignation of the 
          father. <br><br>
          
          This plan being agreed upon, Monsieur René d'Esparvieu sent for his 
          son to come to him in his study. <br><br>
          
          To add to the solemnity of the occasion, he 
          had arrayed himself in his frock-coat. <br><br>
          
          As soon as Maurice saw it he knew 
          there was something serious in the wind. <br><br>
          
          The head of the family was pale, 
          and his voice shook a little (for he was a nervous man), as he declared that 
          he would no longer put up with his son's irregular behaviour, and insisted 
          on an immediate and absolute reform. <br><br>
          
          No more wild courses, no more 
          running into debt, no more undesirable companions, but work, steadiness, 
          and reputable connexions. <br><br>


          Maurice was quite willing to give a respectful reply to his father, whose 
          complaints, after all, were perfectly justified; but, unfortunately, Maurice, 
          like his father, was shy, and the frock-coat which Monsieur d'Esparvieu had 
          donned in order to discharge his magisterial duty with greater dignity 
          seemed to preclude the possibility of any open and unconstrained 
          intercourse. <br><br>
          
          Maurice maintained an awkward silence, which looked very 
          much like insolence, and this silence compelled Monsieur d'Esparvieu to 
          reiterate his complaints, this time with additional severity. <br><br>
          
          He opened one of 
          the drawers in his historic bureau (the bureau on which Alexandre 
          d'Esparvieu had written his "Essay on the Civil and Religious Institutions of 
          the World"), and produced the bills which Maurice had signed. <br><br>


          "Do you know, my boy," said he, "that this is nothing more nor less than 
          forgery? To make up for such grave misconduct as that——" 
          At this moment Madame d'Esparvieu, as arranged, entered the room attired 
          in her walking-dress. <br><br>
          
          She was supposed to play the angel of forgiveness, but 
          neither her appearance nor her disposition was suitable to the part. <br><br>
          
          She was 
          harsh and unsympathetic. <br><br>
          
          Maurice harboured within him the seeds of all 
          the ordinary and necessary virtues. <br><br>
          
          He loved his mother and respected her. <br><br>


          His love, however, was more a matter of duty than of inclination, and his 
          respect arose from habit rather than from feeling. <br><br>
          
          Madame René 
          d'Esparvieu's complexion was blotchy, and having powdered herself in order 
          to appear to advantage at the domestic tribunal, the colour of her face 
          suggested raspberries sprinkled over with sugar. <br><br>
          
          Maurice, being possessed 
          of some taste, could not help realising that she was ugly and rather 
          repulsively so. <br><br>
          
          He was out of tune with her, and when she began to go 
          through all the accusations his father had brought against him, making 
          them out to be blacker than ever, the prodigal turned away his head to 
          conceal his irritation. <br><br>


          "Your Aunt de Saint-Fain," she went on, "met you in the street in such 
          disgraceful company that she was really thankful that you forbore to greet 
          her."<br><br>
          
          
          "Aunt de Saint-Fain!" Maurice broke out. <br><br>
          
          "I like to hear her talking about 
          scandals! Everyone knows the sort of life she has led, and now the old 
          hypocrite wants to——" 
          He stopped. <br><br>
          
          He had caught sight of his father, whose face was even more 
          eloquent of sorrow than of anger. <br><br>
          
          Maurice began to feel as though he had 
          committed murder, and could not imagine how he had allowed such words 
          to escape him. <br><br>
          
          He was on the point of bursting into tears, falling on his 
          knees, and imploring his father to forgive him, when his mother, looking up 
          at the ceiling, said with a sigh: 
          "What offence can I have committed against God, to have brought such a 
          wicked son into the world?" 
          This speech struck Maurice as a piece of ridiculous affectation, and it pulled 
          him up with a jerk. <br><br>
          
          The bitterness of contrition suddenly gave place to the 
          delicious arrogance of wrong-doing. <br><br>
          
          He plunged wildly into a torrent of 
          insolence and revolt, and breathlessly delivered himself of utterances quite 
          unfit for a mother's ear. <br><br>


          "If you will have it, mamma, rather than forbid me to continue my friendship 
          with a talented lyrical artist, you would be better employed in preventing my 
          elder sister, Madame de Margy, from appearing, night after night, in society 
          and at the theatres with a contemptible and disgusting individual that 
          everybody knows is her lover. <br><br>
          
          You should also keep an eye on my little sister 
          Jeanne, who writes objectionable letters to herself in a disguised hand, and 
          then, pretending she has found them in her prayer-book, shows them to you 
          with assumed innocence, to worry and alarm you. <br><br>
          
          It would be just as well, 
          too, if you prevented my little brother Léon, a child of seven, from being 
          quite so much with Mademoiselle Caporal, and you might tell your maid...." <br><br>

          "Get out, sir, I will not have you in the house!" cried Monsieur René 
          d'Esparvieu, white with anger, pointing a trembling finger at the door. <br><br>

        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN WE SEE HOW THE ANGEL, HAVING BECOME A MAN, 
          BEHAVES LIKE A MAN, COVETING ANOTHER'S WIFE AND BETRAYING 
          HIS FRIEND. IN THIS CHAPTER THE CORRECTNESS OF YOUNG 
          D'ESPARVIEU'S CONDUCT WILL BE MADE MANIFEST</p>

          <p>
            HE angel was pleased with his lodging. He worked of a morning, went out in 
            the afternoon, heedless of detectives, and came home to sleep. <br><br>
            
            As in days 
            gone by, Maurice received Madame des Aubels twice or thrice a week in the 
            room in which they had seen the apparition. <br><br>


            All went very well until one morning Gilberte, having, the night before, left 
            her little velvet bag on the table in the blue room, came to find it, and 
            discovered Arcade stretched on the couch in his pyjamas, smoking a 
            cigarette, and dreaming of the conquest of Heaven. <br><br>
            
            She gave a loud scream. <br><br>


            "You, Monsieur! Had I thought to find you here, you may be quite sure I 
            should not ...<br><br>
            
            I came to fetch my little bag, which is in the next room. Allow 
            me...."<br><br>
            
            And she slipped past the angel, cautiously and quickly, as if he were 
            a brazier.<br><br>
            
            
            Madame des Aubels that morning, in her pale green tailor-made costume, 
            was deliciously attractive.<br><br>
            
            Her tight skirt displayed her movements, and her 
            every step was one of those miracles of Nature which fill men's hearts with 
            amazement.<br><br>
            
            
            She reappeared, bag in hand. 
            "Once more—I ask your pardon.... I never dreamt that...." <br><br>

            Arcade begged her to sit down and to stay a moment. 
            "I never expected, Monsieur," said she, "that you would be doing the 
            honours of this flat. I knew how dearly Monsieur d'Esparvieu loved you.... <br><br>

            Nevertheless, I had no idea that...." <br><br>

            The sky had suddenly grown overcast. <br><br>
            
            A brownish glare began to steal into 
            the room. <br><br>
            
            Madame des Aubels told him she had walked for her health's 
            sake, but a storm was brewing, and she asked if a carriage could be called 
            for her. <br><br>
            
            
            Arcade flung himself at Gilberte's feet, took her in his arms as one takes a 
            precious piece of china, and murmured words which, being meaningless in 
            themselves, expressed desire. <br><br>
            
            
            She put her hands over his eyes and on his lips, and exclaimed, "I hate you!" 
            And shaking with sobs, she asked for a drink of water. <br><br>
            
            She was choking. <br><br>
            
             
            The angel went to her assistance. <br><br>
            
            In this moment of extreme peril she 
            defended herself courageously. <br><br>
            
            She kept saying: "No!... No!... I will not love 
            you. I should love you too well...." Nevertheless she succumbed.<br><br>
            
            
            In the sweet familiarity which followed their mutual astonishment she said 
            to him: 
            "I have often asked after you.<br><br>
            
            I knew that you were an assiduous frequenter 
            of 
            the playhouses at Montmartre,—that you were often seen with 
            Mademoiselle Bouchotte, who, nevertheless, is not at all pretty.<br><br>
            
            I knew that 
            you had become very smart, and that you were making a good deal of 
            money.<br><br>
            
            I was not surprised.<br><br>
            
             You were born to succeed.<br><br>
            
             The day of your"—
            and she pointed at the spot between the window and the wardrobe with the 
            mirror—"apparition, I was vexed with Maurice for having given you a 
            suicide's rags to wear.<br><br>
            
            You pleased me.... Oh, it was not your good looks! <br><br>

            Don't think that women are as sensitive as people say to outward 
            attractions. <br><br>
            
            We consider other things in love. <br><br>
            
            There is a sort of—— Well, 
            anyhow I loved you as soon as I saw you."<br><br>
            
            
            The shadows grew deeper. 
            She asked: 
            "You are not an angel, are you? Maurice believes you are; but he believes so 
            many things, Maurice."<br><br>
            
            She questioned Arcade with her eyes and smiled 
            maliciously. "Confess that you have been fooling him, and that you are no 
            angel?" 
            Arcade replied: 
            "I only aspire to please you; I will always be what you want me to be."<br><br>

            Gilberte decided that he was no angel; first, because one never is an angel; 
            secondly, for more detailed reasons which drew her thoughts to the question 
            of love. <br><br>
            
            He did not argue the matter with her, and once again words were 
            found inadequate to express their feelings. <br><br>


            Outside, the rain was falling thick and fast, the windows were streaming, 
            lightning lit up the muslin curtains, and thunder shook the panes. <br><br>
            
            Gilberte 
            made the sign of the Cross and remained with her head hidden in her lover's 
            bosom. <br><br>


            At this moment Maurice entered the room. <br><br>
            
            He came in wet and smiling, 
            confident, tranquil, happy, to announce to Arcade the good news that with 
            his half-share in the previous day's race at Longchamps the angel had won 
            twelve times his stake. <br><br>
            
            Surprising the lady and the angel in their embrace, 
            he became furious; anger gripped the muscles of his throat, his face grew 
            red with blood, and the veins stood out on his forehead. <br><br>
            
            He sprang with 
            clenched fists towards Gilberte, and then suddenly stopped. <br><br>


            Interrupted motion was transformed into heat. <br><br>
            
            Maurice fumed. <br><br>
            
            His anger 
            did not arm him, like Archilochus, with lyrical vengeance. <br><br>
            
            He merely applied 
            an offensive epithet to his unfaithful one. <br><br>


            Meanwhile she had recovered her dignified bearing. <br><br>
            
            She rose, full of modesty 
            and grace, and gave her accuser a look which expressed both offended 
            virtue and loving forgiveness. <br><br>


            But as young d'Esparvieu continued to shower coarse and monotonous 
            insults on her, she grew angry in her turn. <br><br>


            "You are a pretty sort of person, are you not?" she said. <br><br>
            
            "Did I run after this 
            Arcade of yours? It was you who brought him here, and in what a state, too! 
            You had only one idea: to give me up to your friend. <br><br>
            
            Well, Monsieur, you can 
            do as you like—I am not going to oblige you."<br><br>
            
            
            Maurice d'Esparvieu replied simply, "Get out of it, you trollop!" And he made 
            a motion as if to push her out. <br><br>
            
            It pained Arcade to see his mistress treated 
            so disrespectfully, but he thought he lacked the necessary authority to 
            interfere with Maurice. <br><br>
            
            Madame des Aubels, who had lost none of her 
            dignity, fixed young d'Esparvieu with her imperious gaze, and said: 
            "Go and get me a carriage."<br><br>
            
            
            And so great is the power of woman over a well-bred soul, in a gallant 
            nation, that the young Frenchman went immediately and told the concierge 
            to call a taxi. <br><br>
            
            Madame des Aubels, with a studied exhibition of charm in 
            every movement, took leave of them, throwing Maurice the contemptuous 
            look that a woman owes to him whom she has deceived. <br><br>
            
            Maurice witnessed 
            her departure with an outward expression of indifference he was far from 
            feeling. <br><br>
            
            Then he turned to the angel clad in the flowered pyjamas which 
            Maurice himself had worn the day of the apparition; and this circumstance, 
            trifling in itself, added fuel to the anger of the host who had been thus 
            shamefully deceived. <br><br>


            "Well," he said, "you may pride yourself on being a despicable individual. <br><br>


            You have behaved basely, and all for nothing. <br><br>
            
            If the woman took your fancy, 
            you had but to tell me. <br><br>
            
            I was tired of her. <br><br>
            
            I had had enough of her. <br><br>
            
            I would 
            have willingly left her to you."<br><br>
            
            
            He spoke thus to hide his pain, for he loved Gilberte more than ever, and the 
            creature's treachery caused him great suffering. <br><br>
            
            He pursued: 
            "I was about to ask you to take her off my hands. <br><br>
            
            But you have followed 
            your lower nature—you have behaved like a sweep."<br><br>
            
            
            If at this solemn moment Arcade had but spoken one word from his heart, 
            Maurice would have burst into tears, and forgiven his friend and his 
            mistress, and all three would have become content and happy once again. <br><br>


            But Arcade had not been nourished on the milk of human kindness. <br><br>
            
            He had 
            never suffered, and did not know how to sympathise with suffering. <br><br>
            
            He 
            replied with frigid wisdom: 
            "My dear Maurice, that same necessity which orders and constrains the 
            actions of living beings, produces effects that are often unexpected, and 
            sometimes absurd. <br><br>
            
            Thus it is that I have been led to displease you. <br><br>
            
            You 
            would not reproach me if you had a good philosophical understanding of 
            nature; for you would then know that free-will is but an illusion, and that 
            physiological affinities are as exactly determined as are chemical 
            combinations, and, like them, may be summed up in a formula. <br><br>
            
            I think that, 
            in your case, it might be possible to inculcate these truths, but it would be a 
            difficult task, and maybe they would not bring you the serenity which eludes 
            you. <br><br>
            
            It is fitting, therefore, that I should leave this spot, and——" 
            "Stay," said Maurice. <br><br>


            Maurice had a very clear sense of social obligations. <br><br>
            
            He put honour, when 
            he thought about it, above everything. <br><br>
            
            So now he told himself very forcibly 
            that the outrage he had suffered could only be wiped out with blood. <br><br>
            
            This 
            traditional idea instantly lent an unexpected nobility to his speech and 
            bearing. <br><br>


            "It is I, Monsieur," said he, "who will quit this place, never to return. <br><br>
            
            You will 
            remain here, since you are a refugee. <br><br>
            
            My seconds will wait upon you."<br><br>
            
            
            The angel smiled. <br><br>


            "I will receive them, if it gives you pleasure, but, bethink you, my dear 
            Maurice, I am invulnerable. <br><br>
            
            Celestial spirits even when they are materialised 
            cannot be touched by point of sword or pistol shot. <br><br>
            
            Consider, my dear 
            Maurice, the awkward situation in which this fatal inequality puts me, and 
            realise that in refusing to appoint seconds I cannot give as a reason my 
            celestial nature,—it would be unprecedented."<br><br>
            
            
            "Monsieur," replied the heir of the Bussart d'Esparvieu, "you should have 
            thought of that before you insulted me."<br><br>
            
            
            Out he marched haughtily; but no sooner was he in the street than he 
            staggered like a drunken man. <br><br>
            
            The rain was still falling. <br><br>
            
            He walked 
            unseeing, unhearing, at haphazard, dragging his feet in the gutters through 
            pools of water, through heaps of mud. <br><br>
            
            He followed the outer boulevards for a 
            long time, and at length, fordone with weariness, lay down on the edge of a 
            piece of waste land. <br><br>
            
            He was muddied up to the eyes, mud and tears smeared 
            his face, the brim of his hat was dripping with rain. <br><br>
            
            A passer-by, taking him 
            for a beggar, tossed him a copper. <br><br>
            
            He picked it up, put it carefully in his 
            waistcoat pocket, and set off to find his seconds. <br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 30</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHICH TREATS OF AN AFFAIR OF HONOUR, AND WHICH WILL 
          AFFORD THE READER AN OPPORTUNITY OF JUDGING WHETHER, AS 
          ARCADE AFFIRMS, THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR FAULTS MAKES 
          BETTER MEN AND WOMEN OF US</p>

          <p>
            THE ground chosen for the combat was Colonel Manchon's garden, on the 
            Boulevard de la Reine at Versailles. <br><br>
            
            Messieurs de la Verdelière and Le Truc 
            de Ruffec, who had both of them constant practice in affairs of honour and 
            knew the rules with great exactness, assisted Maurice d'Esparvieu. <br><br>
            
            No duel 
            was ever fought in the Catholic world without Monsieur de la Verdelière 
            being present; and, in making application to this swordsman, Maurice had 
            conformed to custom, though not without a certain reluctance, for he had 
            been notorious as the lover of Madame de la Verdelière; but Monsieur de la 
            Verdelière was not to be looked upon as a husband. <br><br>
            
            He was an institution. <br><br>


            As to Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec, honour was his only known profession 
            and avowedly his sole resource, and when the matter was made the subject 
            of ill-natured comment in Society, the question was asked what finer career 
            than that of honour Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec could possibly have 
            adopted. <br><br>
            
            Arcade's seconds were Prince Istar and Théophile. <br><br>
            
            The celestial 
            musician had not voluntarily nor with a good grace taken a hand in this 
            affair. <br><br>
            
            He had a horror of every kind of violence and disapproved of single 
            combat. <br><br>
            
            The report of pistols and the clash of swords were intolerable to 
            him, and the sight of blood made him faint. <br><br>
            
            This gentle son of Heaven had 
            obstinately refused to act as second to his brother Arcade, and to bring him 
            to the starting-point the Kerûb had had to threaten to break a bottle of 
            panclastite over his head. <br><br>


            Besides the combatants, the seconds, and the doctors, the only people in 
            the garden were a few officers from the barracks at Versailles and several 
            reporters. <br><br>
            
            Although young d'Esparvieu was known merely as a young man of 
            family, and Arcade had never been heard of at all, the duel had attracted 
            quite a large crowd of inquisitive individuals, and the windows of the 
            adjoining houses were crammed with photographers, reporters, and Society 
            people. <br><br>
            
            What had aroused much curiosity was that a woman was known to 
            be the cause of the quarrel. <br><br>
            
            Many mentioned Bouchotte, but the majority 
            said it was Madame des Aubels. <br><br>
            
            It had been remarked upon, moreover, that 
            duels in which Monsieur de la Verdelière acted as second drew all Paris. <br><br>


            The sky was a soft blue, the garden all a-bloom with roses, a blackbird was 
            piping in a tree. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur de la Verdelière, who, stick in hand, conducted 
            the affair, laid the points of the swords together, and said: 
            "Allez, Messieurs."<br><br>
            
            
            Maurice d'Esparvieu attacked by doubling and beating the blade. <br><br>
            
            Arcade 
            retired, keeping his sword in line. <br><br>
            
            The first engagement was without result. <br><br>


            The seconds were under the impression that Monsieur d'Esparvieu was in a 
            grievous state of nervous irritability, and that his adversary would wear him 
            down. <br><br>
            
            In the second encounter Maurice attacked wildly, spread out his 
            arms, and exposed his breast. <br><br>
            
            He attacked as he advanced, gave a straight 
            thrust, and the point of his sword grazed Arcade on the shoulder. <br><br>
            
            The latter 
            was thought to be wounded. <br><br>
            
            But the seconds ascertained with surprise that 
            it was Maurice who had received a scratch on the wrist. <br><br>
            
            Maurice asserted 
            that he felt nothing, and Dr. <br><br>
            
            Quille declared, after examination, that his 
            client might continue the fight. <br><br>
            
            After the regulation quarter of an hour the 
            duel was resumed. <br><br>
            
            Maurice attacked with fury. <br><br>
            
            His adversary was obviously 
            nursing him, and, what disturbed Monsieur de la Verdelière, seemed to be 
            paying very little attention to his own defence. <br><br>
            
            At the opening of the fifth 
            bout, a black spaniel that had got into the garden no one knew how rushed 
            out from a clump of rose-bushes, made its way on to the space reserved for 
            the combatants, and, in spite of sticks and cries, ran in between Maurice's 
            legs. <br><br>
            
            The latter seemed as though his arm were benumbed, merely gave a 
            shoulder-thrust at his invulnerable opponent. <br><br>
            
            He then delivered a straight 
            lunge and impaled his arm on his adversary's sword, which made a deep 
            wound just below the elbow. <br><br>


            Monsieur de la Verdelière stopped the fight, which had lasted an hour and a 
            half. <br><br>
            
            Maurice was conscious of a painful shock. <br><br>
            
            They laid him down on a 
            grassy bank against a wall covered with wistaria. <br><br>
            
            While the surgeon was 
            dressing the wound Maurice called Arcade and offered him his wounded 
            hand. <br><br>
            
            And when the victor, saddened with his victory, advanced, Maurice 
            embraced him tenderly, saying: 
            "Be generous, Arcade; forgive my treachery. <br><br>
            
            Now that we have fought, I can 
            ask you to be reconciled with me."<br><br>
            
            
            He embraced his friend, weeping, and whispered in his ear: 
            "Come and see me, and bring Gilberte."<br><br>
            
            
            Maurice, who was still unreconciled with his parents, was taken to the little 
            flat in the Rue de Rome. <br><br>
            
            No sooner was he stretched on the bed at the far 
            end of the bedroom where the curtains were drawn as on the day of the 
            apparition, than he saw Arcade and Gilberte appear. <br><br>
            
            He began to suffer 
            greatly from his wound; his temperature was rising, but he was at peace, 
            happy and contented. <br><br>
            
            Angel and woman, both in tears, threw themselves at 
            the foot of the bed. <br><br>
            
            He took both their hands with his left, smiled on them, 
            and kissed them tenderly. <br><br>


            "I am sure now that I shall never quarrel with either of you again; you will 
            deceive me no more. <br><br>
            
            I now know you are capable of anything."<br><br>
            
            
            Gilberte, weeping, swore that Maurice had been misled by appearances, that 
            she had never betrayed him with Arcade, that she had never betrayed him at 
            all. <br><br>
            
            And in a great gush of sincerity she persuaded herself that this was so. <br><br>


            "You wrong yourself, Gilberte," replied the wounded man. <br><br>
            
            "It did happen; it 
            had to. <br><br>
            
            And it is well. <br><br>
            
            Gilberte, you were basely false to me with my best 
            friend in this very room, and you were right. <br><br>
            
            If you had not been we should 
            not be here, reunited, all three of us, and I should not be at your side 
            tasting the greatest happiness of my life. <br><br>
            
            Oh, Gilberte, how wrong of you to 
            deny a perfect and accomplished fact!" 
            "If you wish, my friend," replied Gilberte, a little acidly, "I will not deny it. <br><br>


            But it will only be to please you."<br><br>
            
            
            Maurice made her sit down on the bed, and begged Arcade to be seated in 
            the arm-chair. <br><br>


            "My friend," said Arcade, "I was innocent. <br><br>
            
            I became man. <br><br>
            
            Straightway I did 
            evil. <br><br>
            
            Then I became better."<br><br>
            
            
            "Do not let us exaggerate things," said Maurice. <br><br>
            
            "Let's have a game of 
            bridge."<br><br>
            
            
            Scarcely, however, had the patient seen three aces in his hand and called 
            "no trumps," than his eyes began to swim, the cards slipped from his 
            fingers, head fell heavily back on the pillow, and he complained of a violent 
            headache. <br><br>
            
            Almost immediately, Madame des Aubels went off to pay some 
            calls, for she made a point of appearing in Society, in order that the 
            calmness and confidence of her demeanour might give the lie to the various 
            rumours that were current concerning her. <br><br>
            
            Arcade saw her to the door, and, 
            with a kiss, inhaled from her a delicate perfume which he brought back with 
            him into the room where Maurice lay dozing. <br><br>


            "I am perfectly content," murmured the latter, "that things should have 
            happened as they have."<br><br>
            
            
            "It was bound to be so," answered the Spirit. <br><br>
            
            "All the other angels in revolt 
            would have done as I did with Gilberte. <br><br>
            
            'Women,' saith the Apostle, 'should 
            pray with their heads covered, because of the angels,' and the Apostle 
            speaks thus because he knows that the angels are disturbed when they look 
            upon them and see that they are beautiful. <br><br>
            
            No sooner do they touch the 
            earth than they desire to embrace mortal women and fulfil their desire.T<br><br>
            
            heir 
            clasp is full of strength and sweetness, they hold the secret of those ineffable 
            caresses which plunge the daughters of men into unfathomable depths of 
            delight. <br><br>
            
            Laying upon the lips of their happy victims a honey that burns like 
            fire, making their veins flow with torrents of refreshing flames, they leave 
            them raptured and undone."<br><br>
            
            
            "Stop your clatter, you unclean beast," cried the wounded one. <br><br>


            "One word more!" said the angel; "just one other word, my dear Maurice, to 
            bear out what I say, and I will let you rest quietly. <br><br>
            
            There's nothing like 
            having sound references. <br><br>
            
            In order to assure yourself that I am not deceiving 
            you, Maurice, on this subject of the amorous embraces of angels and 
            women, look up Justin, Apologies, I and II; Flavius Josephus, Jewish 
            Antiquities, Book I, Chapter III; Athenagoras, Concerning the Resurrection; 
            Lactantius, Book II, Chapter XV; Tertullian, On the Veil of the Virgins; 
            Marcus of Ephesus in Psellus; Eusebius, Præparatio Evangelica, Book V, 
            Chapter IV; Saint Ambrose, in his book on Noah and the Ark, Chapter V; 
            Saint Augustine, in his City of God, Book XV, Chapter XXIII; Father 
            Meldonat, the Jesuit, Treatise on Demons, page 248; Pierre Lebyer the 
            King's Counsellor——" 
            "Arcade, please, for pity's sake, be quiet; do, please do, and send this dog 
            away," cried Maurice, whose face was burning, and whose eyes were starting 
            from his head; for in his delirium he thought he saw a black spaniel on his 
            bed. <br><br>


            Madame de la Verdelière, who was assiduous in every modish and patriotic 
            practice, was reckoned, in the best French society, as one of the most 
            gracious of the great ladies interested in good works. <br><br>
            
            She came herself to 
            ask for news of Maurice, and offered to nurse the wounded man. <br><br>
            
            But at the 
            vehement instigation of Madame des Aubels, Arcade shut the door in her 
            face. <br><br>
            
            Expressions of sympathy were showered upon Maurice. <br><br>
            
            Piled on the 
            salver, visiting cards displayed their innumerable little dogs' ears. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur 
            Le Truc de Ruffec was one of the first to show his manly sympathy at the flat 
            in the Rue de Rome, and, holding out his loyal hand, asked young 
            d'Esparvieu as one honourable man to another for twenty-five louis to pay a 
            debt of honour. <br><br>


            "Of course, my dear Maurice, that is the sort of thing one could not ask of 
            everybody."<br><br>
            
            
            The same day Monsieur Gaétan came to press his nephew's hand. <br><br>
            
            The latter 
            introduced Arcade. <br><br>


            "This is my guardian angel, whose foot you thought so beautiful when you 
            saw the print it had made on the tell-tale powder, uncle. <br><br>
            
            He appeared to me 
            last year in this very room. <br><br>
            
            You don't believe it? Well, it is true, 
            nevertheless."<br><br>
            
            
            Then turning towards the Spirit he said: 
            "What say you, Arcade? The Abbé Patouille, who is a great theologian and a 
            good priest, does not believe that you are an angel; and Uncle Gaétan, who 
            doesn't know his catechism and hasn't a scrap of religion in him, doesn't 
            think so either. <br><br>
            
            They deny you, the pair of them; the one because he has 
            faith, the other because he hasn't. <br><br>
            
            After that you may be sure that your 
            history, if ever it comes to be narrated, will scarcely appear credible. <br><br>


            Moreover, the man that took it into his head to tell your story would not be a 
            man of taste, and would not come in for much approval. <br><br>
            
            For your story is 
            not a pretty one. <br><br>
            
            I love you, but I sit in judgment upon you, too. <br><br>
            
            Since you 
            fell into atheism, you have become an abominable scoundrel. <br><br>
            
            A bad angel, a 
            bad friend, a traitor, and a homicide, for I suppose it was to bring about my 
            death that you sent that black spaniel between my legs on the duelling
            ground."<br><br>
            
            
            The angel shrugged his shoulders and, addressing Gaétan, said: 
            "Alas! Monsieur, I am not surprised at finding little credit in your eyes. <br><br>
            
            I 
            have been told that you have fallen out with the Judæo-Christian heaven, 
            which is where I came from."<br><br>
            
            
            "Monsieur," answered Gaétan, "my faith in Jehovah is not sufficiently strong 
            to enable me to believe in his angels."<br><br>
            
            
            "Monsieur, he whom you call Jehovah is really a coarse and ignorant 
            demiurge, and his name is Ialdabaoth."<br><br>
            
            
            "In that case, Monsieur, I am perfectly ready to believe in him. <br><br>
            
            He is a 
            narrow-minded ignoramus, is he? Then belief in his existence offers me no 
            further difficulty. <br><br>
            
            How is he getting on?" 
            "Badly! We are going to lay him low next month."<br><br>
            
            
            "Don't make too sure of that, Monsieur. <br><br>
            
            You remind me of my brother-in
            law, Cuissart, who has been expecting to hear of the fall of the Republic for 
            the past thirty years."<br><br>
            
            
            "You see, Arcade," exclaimed Maurice, "Uncle Gaétan thinks as I do. <br><br>
            
            He 
            knows you won't succeed."<br><br>
            
            
            "And, pray, Monsieur Gaétan, what makes you think I shall not succeed?" 
            "Your Ialdabaoth is still very powerful in this world, if he isn't in the other. <br><br>


            In days gone by he used to be upheld by his priests, by those who believed 
            in him. <br><br>
            
            Now he is supported by those who do not believe in him, by the 
            philosophers. <br><br>
            
            A pedant of a fellow called Picrochole has recently come on the 
            scene who wants to make a bankrupt of science in order to do a good turn 
            to the Church. <br><br>
            
            And just lately Pragmatism has been invented for the express 
            purpose of gaining credit for religion in the minds of rationalists."<br><br>
            
            
            "You have been studying Pragmatism?" 
            "Not I! I was frivolous once, and I went in for metaphysics. <br><br>
            
            I read Hegel and 
            Kant. <br><br>
            
            I have become serious with years, and now I only trouble myself about 
            things evident to the senses: what the eye can see or what the ear can hear. <br><br>


            Man is summed up in Art. <br><br>
            
            All the rest is moonshine."<br><br>
            
            
            Thus the conversation went on until evening; it was marked by obscenities 
            that would have brought a blush—I will not say to a cuirassier, for 
            cuirassiers are frequently chaste, but even to a Parisienne. <br><br>


            Monsieur Sariette came to see his old pupil. <br><br>
            
            When he entered the room the 
            bust of Alexandre d'Esparvieu seemed to take shape behind the librarian's 
            bald head. <br><br>
            
            He drew near the bed. <br><br>
            
            In the place of blue curtains, mirrored 
            wardrobe, and chimney-piece, there straightway came into view the heavy
            laden bookcases of the room of the globes and busts, and the air was heavy 
            with piles of papers, records, and files. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur Sariette could not be 
            dissociated from his library; one could not conceive of him or even see him 
            apart from it. <br><br>
            
            He himself was paler, more vague, more shadowy, and more a 
            creature of the fancy than the fancies he evoked. <br><br>


            Maurice, who had grown very quiet, was sensible of this mark of friendship. <br><br>


            "Sit down, Monsieur Sariette,—you know Madame des Aubels. <br><br>
            
            May I 
            introduce Arcade to you,—my guardian angel. <br><br>
            
            It was he who, while yet 
            invisible, pillaged your library for two years, made you lose all desire for food 
            and drink, and drove you to the verge of madness. <br><br>
            
            He it was who moved 
            piles of books from the room of the busts to my summer-house one day; 
            under your very nose, he took away I know not what precious volumes; and 
            was the cause of your falling on the staircase; another day he took a volume 
            of Salomon Reinach's, and, forced to go out with me (for he never left me, as 
            I have learnt later), he let the volume drop in the gutter of the Rue Princesse. <br><br>


            Forgive him, Monsieur Sariette,—he had no pockets. <br><br>
            
            He was invisible. <br><br>
            
            I 
            bitterly regret, Monsieur Sariette, that all your old books were not devoured 
            by fire or swallowed up by a flood. <br><br>
            
            They made my angel lose his head. <br><br>
            
            He 
            became man, and now knows neither faith nor obedience to laws. <br><br>
            
            It is I, 
            now, who am his guardian angel. <br><br>
            
            God knows how it will all end."<br><br>
            
            
            While listening to this speech, Monsieur Sariette's face took on an 
            expression of infinite, irreparable, eternal sadness; the sadness of a 
            mummy. <br><br>
            
            Rising to take his leave, the sorrowful librarian murmured in 
            Arcade's ear: 
            "The poor child is very ill. <br><br>
            
            He is delirious."<br><br>
            
            
            Maurice called the old man back. <br><br>


            "Do stay, Monsieur Sariette. <br><br>
            
            You shall have a game of bridge with us. <br><br>


            Monsieur Sariette, listen to my advice. <br><br>
            
            Do not do as I did—do not keep bad 
            company. <br><br>
            
            You will be lost. <br><br>
            
            I shudder at the mere thought. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur Sariette, 
            do not go yet. <br><br>
            
            I have something very important to ask you. <br><br>
            
            When you come 
            again, bring me a book on the truth of religion, so that I may study it. <br><br>
            
            I must 
            restore to my guardian-angel the faith which he has lost."<br><br>


          </p>



        <h2>Chapter 31</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHEREIN WE ARE LED TO MARVEL AT THE READINESS WITH WHICH 
          AN HONEST MAN OF TIMID AND GENTLE NATURE CAN COMMIT A 
          HORRIBLE CRIME</p>

          <p>
            PROFOUNDLY distressed by the dark utterances of young Maurice, Monsieur 
            Sariette took a motor-omnibus, and went to see Père Guinardon, his friend, 
            his only friend, the one person in the whole world whom it gave him 
            pleasure to see and hear. <br><br>
            
            When Monsieur Sariette entered the shop in the 
            Rue de Courcelles, Guinardon was alone, dozing in the depths of an antique 
            arm-chair. <br><br>
            
            His face, surrounded by his curly hair and luxuriant beard, was 
            crimson in hue. <br><br>
            
            Little violet filaments spread a network about the fleshy part 
            of his nose, to which the wines of Burgundy had imparted a purple tint; for 
            there was no longer any disguising the fact, Père Guinardon drank. <br><br>
            
            Two feet 
            away from him, on the fair Octavie's work-table, a rose, all but withered, 
            drooped in an empty vase, and in a basket a piece of embroidery was lying 
            unfinished and neglected. <br><br>
            
            The young Octavie's absences from the shop were 
            growing more and more frequent, and Monsieur Blancmesnil never called 
            when she was not there. <br><br>
            
            The reason of this was that they were meeting three 
            times a week at five o'clock in a house close to the Champs Élysées. <br><br>
            
            Père 
            Guinardon knew nothing of that. <br><br>
            
            He did not know the full extent of his 
            misfortune, but he suffered. <br><br>


            Monsieur Sariette shook his old friend by the hand; but he did not enquire 
            for the young Octavie, for he refused to recognise the connexion. <br><br>
            
            He would 
            sooner have talked about Zéphyrine, who had been so cruelly deserted, and 
            whom he hoped the old man would make his lawful wife. <br><br>
            
            But Monsieur 
            Sariette was prudent. <br><br>
            
            He contented himself with asking Guinardon how he 
            was. <br><br>


            "Perfectly well," was Guinardon's reply; but he felt ill, for either age and love
            making had undermined his sturdy constitution, or else young Octavie's 
            faithlessness had dealt her lover a fatal blow. <br><br>
            
            "God be praised," he went on, 
            "I still retain my powers of mind and body. <br><br>
            
            I am chaste. <br><br>
            
            Be chaste, Sariette. <br><br>


            Chastity is strength."<br><br>
            
            
            That evening Père Guinardon had taken some specially valuable books out 
            of the king-wood cabinet to show to a distinguished bibliophile, Monsieur 
            Victor Meyer, and after the latter's departure he had dropped off to sleep 
            without putting them back in their places. <br><br>
            
            Books had an attraction for 
            Monsieur Sariette, and seeing these particular volumes on the marble top of 
            the cabinet, he began to examine them with interest. <br><br>
            
            The first one he looked 
            at was La Pucelle, in morocco, with the English continuation. <br><br>
            
            Doubtless it 
            pained his patriotic and Christian heart to admire its text and illustrations, 
            but a good copy was always virtuous and pure in his sight. <br><br>
            
            Continuing to 
            chat very affectionately with Guinardon, he picked up, one by one, the 
            books which the antiquary had, for one reason or another—binding, 
            illustrations, distinguished ownership, or scarcity—added to his stock. <br><br>


            Suddenly a glorious shout of joy and love broke from his lips. <br><br>
            
            He had 
            discovered the Lucretius of the Prior de Vendôme, his Lucretius, and he was 
            clasping it to his bosom. <br><br>


            "Once again I behold you," he sighed, as he pressed it to his lips. <br><br>


            At first Père Guinardon could not quite make out what his old friend was 
            talking about; but when the latter declared to him that the volume was from 
            the d'Esparvieu collection, that it belonged to him, Sariette, and that he was 
            going to take it away without further ado, the antiquary completely woke up, 
            got on his legs, declared emphatically that the book belonged to him, 
            Guinardon, by right of true and lawful purchase, and that he would not part 
            with it unless he got five thousand francs for it cash down. <br><br>


            "You don't take in what I am telling you," answered Sariette. <br><br>
            
            "The book 
            belongs to the d'Esparvieu library; I must restore it to its place."<br><br>
            
            
            "Pas de ça, Lisette"—— hummed Guinardon. <br><br>


            "The book belongs to me, I tell you!" 
            "You are crazy, my good Sariette!" 
            And noticing that, as a matter of fact, the librarian had a wandering look in 
            his eye, he took the book from him, and tried to change the conversation. <br><br>


            "Have you seen, Sariette, that the rascals are going to rip up the Palais 
            Mazarin, and cover up the very heart and centre of the Old Town, the finest 
            and most venerable place in the whole of Paris, with the deuce knows what 
            works of art of theirs? They are worse than the Vandals, for the Vandals, 
            although they destroyed the buildings of antiquity, did not replace them 
            with hideous and disgusting erections and atrocious bridges like the Pont 
            d'Alexandre. <br><br>
            
            And your poor Rue Garancière, Sariette, has fallen a prey to the 
            barbarians. <br><br>
            
            What have they done with the pretty bronze mask of the Palace 
            fountain?" 
            Monsieur Sariette never listened to a word of all this. <br><br>


            "Guinardon, you have not understood me. <br><br>
            
            Now listen. <br><br>
            
            This book belongs to 
            the d'Esparvieu library. <br><br>
            
            It was taken away, how or by whom I know not. <br><br>


            Dreadful and mysterious things went on in that library. <br><br>
            
            But, anyhow, the 
            book was stolen. <br><br>
            
            I need scarcely appeal to your sentiments of scrupulous 
            probity, my dear friend. <br><br>
            
            You would not like to be regarded as the receiver of 
            stolen goods. <br><br>
            
            Give me the book. <br><br>
            
            I will return it to Monsieur d'Esparvieu, who 
            will duly requite you; of that you may be sure. <br><br>
            
            Rely on his generosity, and 
            you will be acting like the downright good fellow that you are."<br><br>
            
            
            The antiquary smiled a bitter smile. <br><br>


            "Catch me relying on the generosity of that old curmudgeon of a 
            d'Esparvieu. <br><br>
            
            Why, he'd skin a flea to get its coat. <br><br>
            
            Look at me, Sariette, old 
            boy, and tell me if I look like a dunderhead. <br><br>
            
            You know perfectly well that 
            d'Esparvieu refused to give fifty francs in a second-hand shop for a portrait 
            of Alexandre d'Esparvieu, the founder of the family, by Hersent, and that 
            consequently the founder of the family has had to remain on the Boulevard 
            Montparnasse, propped against a Jew hawker's stall, just opposite the 
            cemetery, where all the dogs of the neighbourhood come and make water on 
            him. <br><br>
            
            Catch me trusting to Monsieur d'Esparvieu's liberality! You've got some 
            bright ideas in your head, you have!" 
            "Very well, Guinardon, I myself will undertake to pay you any indemnity that 
            a board of arbitrators may fix upon. <br><br>
            
            Do you hear?" 
            "Now don't go and do the handsome for people who won't give you so much 
            as a thank-you. <br><br>
            
            This man, d'Esparvieu, has taken your knowledge, your 
            energies, your whole life for a salary that even a valet wouldn't accept. <br><br>
            
            So 
            leave that idea alone. <br><br>
            
            In any case it is too late. <br><br>
            
            The book is sold."<br><br>
            
            
            "Sold? To whom?" asked Sariette in agonized tones. <br><br>


            "What does that matter? You'll never see it again. <br><br>
            
            You'll hear no more about 
            it; it's off to America."<br><br>
            
            
            "To America! The Lucretius with the arms of Philippe de Vendôme and 
            marginalia in Voltaire's own hand! My Lucretius off to America!" 
            Père Guinardon began to laugh. <br><br>


            "My dear Sariette, you remind me of the Chevalier des Grieux when he 
            learns that his darling mistress is to be transported to the Mississippi. <br><br>
            
            'My 
            dear mistress going to the Mississippi!' says he."<br><br>
            
            
            "No! no!" answered Sariette, very pale, "this book shall not go to America. <br><br>
            
            It 
            shall return, as it ought, to the d'Esparvieu library. <br><br>
            
            Let me have it, 
            Guinardon."<br><br>
            
            
            The antiquary made a second attempt to put an end to an interview that 
            now looked as if it might take an ugly turn. <br><br>


            "My good Sariette, you haven't told me what you think of my Greco. <br><br>
            
            You 
            never so much as glanced at it. <br><br>
            
            It is an admirable piece of work all the 
            same."<br><br>
            
            
            And Guinardon, putting the picture in a good light, went on: 
            "Now just look at Saint Francis here, the poor man of the Lord, the brother 
            of Jesus. <br><br>
            
            See how his fuliginous body rises heavenward like the smoke from 
            an agreeable sacrifice, like the sacrifice of Abel."<br><br>
            
            
            "Give me the book, Guinardon," said Sariette, without turning his head; 
            "give me the book."<br><br>
            
            
            The blood suddenly flew to Père Guinardon's head. <br><br>


            "That's enough of it," he shouted, as red as a turkey-cock, the veins 
            standing out on his forehead. <br><br>


            And he dropped the Lucretius into his jacket pocket. <br><br>


            Straightway old Sariette flew at the antiquary, assailed him with sudden 
            fury, and, frail and weakly as he was, butted him back into young Octavie's 
            arm-chair. <br><br>


            Guinardon, in furious amazement, belched forth the most horrible abuse on 
            the old maniac and gave him a punch that sent him staggering back four 
            paces against the Coronation of the Virgin, by Fra Angelico, which fell down 
            with a crash. <br><br>
            
            Sariette returned to the charge, and tried to drag the book out 
            of the pocket in which it lay hid. <br><br>
            
            This time Père Guinardon would really have 
            floored him had he not been blinded by the blood that was rushing to his 
            head, and hit sideways at the work-table of his absent mistress. <br><br>
            
            Sariette 
            fastened himself on to his bewildered adversary, held him down in the arm
            chair, and with his little bony hands clutched him by the neck, which, red 
            as it was already, became a deep crimson. <br><br>
            
            Guinardon struggled to get free, 
            but the little fingers, feeling the mass of soft, warm flesh about them, 
            embedded themselves in it with delicious ecstasy. <br><br>
            
            Some unknown force 
            made them hold fast to their prey. <br><br>
            
            Guinardon's throat began to rattle, saliva 
            was oozing from one corner of his mouth. <br><br>
            
            His enormous frame quivered now 
            and again beneath the grasp; but the tremors grew more and more 
            intermittent and spasmodic. <br><br>
            
            At last they ceased. <br><br>
            
            The murderous hands did 
            not let go their hold. <br><br>
            
            Sariette had to make a violent effort to loose them. <br><br>
            
            His 
            temples were buzzing. <br><br>
            
            Nevertheless he could hear the rain falling outside, 
            muffled steps going past on the pavement, newspaper men shouting in the 
            distance. <br><br>
            
            He could see umbrellas passing along in the dim light. <br><br>
            
            He drew the 
            book from the dead man's pocket and fled. <br><br>


            The fair Octavie did not go back to the shop that night. <br><br>
            
            She went to sleep in 
            a little entresol underneath the bric-a-brac stores which Monsieur de 
            Blancmesnil had recently bought for her in this same Rue de Courcelles. <br><br>


            The workman whose task it was to shut up the shop found the 
            antiquary'sbody still warm. <br><br>
            
            He called Madame Lenain, the concierge, who 
            laid Guinardon on the couch, lit a couple of candles, put a sprig of box in a 
            saucer of holy water, and closed the dead man's eyes. <br><br>
            
            The doctor who was 
            called in to certify the death ascribed it to apoplexy. <br><br>


            Zéphyrine, informed of what had happened by Madame Lenain, hastened to 
            the house, and sat up all night with the body. <br><br>
            
            The dead man looked as if he 
            were sleeping. <br><br>
            
            In the flickering light of the candles El Greco's Saint mounted 
            upwards like a wreath of smoke, the gold of the Primitives gleamed in the 
            shadows. <br><br>
            
            Near the deathbed a little woman by Baudouin was plainly 
            discernible giving herself a douche. <br><br>
            
            All through the night Zéphyrine's 
            lamentations could be heard fifty yards away. <br><br>


            "He's dead, he's dead!" she kept saying. <br><br>
            
            "My friend, my divinity, my all, my 
            love—— But no! he is not dead, he moves. <br><br>
            
            It is I, Michel; I, your Zéphyrine. <br><br>


            Awake, hear me! Answer me; I love you; if ever I caused you pain, forgive 
            me. <br><br>
            
            Dead! dead! O my God! See how beautiful he is. <br><br>
            
            He was so good, so 
            clever, so kind. <br><br>
            
            My God! My God! My God! If I had been there he would not 
            now be lying dead. <br><br>
            
            Michel! Michel!" 
            When morning came she was silent. <br><br>
            
            They thought she had fallen asleep. <br><br>
            
            She 
            was dead too.
<br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 32</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHICH DESCRIBES HOW NECTAIRE'S FLUTE WAS HEARD IN THE 
          TAVERN OF CLODOMIR</p>

          <p>
            ADAME DE LA VERDELIÈRE having failed to force an entrée as sick-nurse, 
            returned after several days had elapsed,—during the absence of Madame 
            des Aubels,—to ask Maurice d'Esparvieu for his subscription to the French 
            churches. <br><br>
            
            Arcade led her to the bedside of the convalescent. <br><br>
            
            Maurice 
            whispered in the angel's ear: 
            "Traitor, deliver me from this ogress immediately, or you will be answerable 
            for the evil which will soon befall."<br><br>
            
            
            "Be calm," said Arcade, with a confident air. <br><br>


            After the conventional complimentary flourishes, Madame de la Verdelière 
            signed to Maurice to dismiss the angel. <br><br>
            
            Maurice feigned not to understand. <br><br>


            And Madame de la Verdelière disclosed the ostensible reason of her visit. <br><br>


            "Our churches," she said, "our beloved country churches,—what is to 
            become of them?" 
            Arcade gazed at her angelically and sighed. <br><br>


            "They will disappear, Madame; they will fall into ruin. <br><br>
            
            And what a pity! I 
            shall be inconsolable. <br><br>
            
            The church amid the villagers' cottages is like the hen 
            amidst her chickens."<br><br>
            
            
            "Just so!" exclaimed Madame de la Verdelière with a delighted smile. <br><br>
            
            "It is 
            just like that."<br><br>
            
            
            "And the spires, Madame?" 
            "Oh, Monsieur, the spires!..." <br><br>

            "Yes, the spires, Madame, that stick up into the skies towards the little 
            Cherubim, like so many syringes."<br><br>

            Madame de la Verdelière incontinently left the place. <br><br>


            That same day Monsieur l'Abbé Patouille came to offer the wounded man 
            good counsel and consolation. <br><br>
            
            He exhorted him to break with his bad 
            companions and to be reconciled to his family. <br><br>


            He drew a picture of the sorrowful father, the mother in tears, ready to 
            receive their long-lost child with open arms. <br><br>
            
            Renouncing with manly effort a 
            life of profligacy and deluding joys, Maurice would recover his peace and 
            strength of mind, he would free himself from devouring chimeras, and shake 
            off the Evil Spirit. <br><br>


            Young d'Esparvieu thanked Abbé Patouille for all his kindness, and made a 
            protestation of his religious feelings. <br><br>


            "Never," said he, "have I had such faith. <br><br>
            
            And never have I been in such need 
            of it. <br><br>
            
            Just imagine, Monsieur l'Abbé, I have to teach my guardian angel his 
            catechism all over again, for he has quite forgotten it!" 
            Monsieur l'Abbé Patouille heaved a deep sigh, and exhorted his dear child to 
            pray, there being no other resource but prayer for a soul assailed by the 
            Devil. <br><br>


            "Monsieur l'Abbé," asked Maurice, "may I introduce my guardian angel to 
            you? Do stay a moment; he has gone to get me some cigarettes."<br><br>
            
            
            "Unhappy child!" 
            And Abbé Patouille's fat cheeks drooped in token of affliction. <br><br>
            
            But almost 
            immediately they plumped up again, as a sign of light-heartedness. <br><br>
            
            For in 
            his heart there was matter for rejoicing. <br><br>
            
            Public opinion was improving. <br><br>
            
            The 
            Jacobins, the Freemasons, the Coalitionists were everywhere in disgrace. <br><br>


            The Smart Set led the way. <br><br>
            
            The Académie Française was of the right way of 
            thinking. <br><br>
            
            The number of Christian schools was increasing by leaps and 
            bounds. <br><br>
            
            The young men of the Quartier Latin were submitting to the 
            Church, and the École Normale exhaled the perfume of the seminary. <br><br>
            
            The 
            Cross was gaining the day; but money was wanted,—more money, always 
            money. <br><br>


            After six weeks' rest, Maurice was allowed by his doctor to take a drive. <br><br>
            
            He 
            wore his arm in a sling. <br><br>
            
            His mistress and his friend went with him. <br><br>
            
            They 
            drove to the Bois, and took a gentle pleasure in looking upon the grass and 
            the trees. <br><br>
            
            They smiled on everything and everything smiled on them. <br><br>
            
            As 
            Arcade had said, their faults had made them better. <br><br>
            
            By the unlooked-for 
            ways of jealousy and anger, Maurice had attained to calm and kindliness. <br><br>


            He still loved Gilberte and he loved her with an indulgent love. <br><br>
            
            The angel 
            still desired her as much as ever, but having once possessed her, his desire 
            had lost the sting of curiosity. <br><br>
            
            Gilberte forbore trying to please, and thereby 
            pleased the more. <br><br>
            
            They drank milk at the Cascade, and found it good. <br><br>
            
            They 
            were all three innocent. <br><br>
            
            Arcade forgot the injustice of the old tyrant of the 
            world. <br><br>
            
            But he was soon to be reminded of it. <br><br>


            On entering his friend's house, he found Zita awaiting him, looking like a 
            statue in ivory and gold. <br><br>


            "You excite my pity," she said to him. <br><br>
            
            "The day is at hand the like of which 
            has never dawned since the beginning of Time, and perhaps will never dawn 
            again before the Sun enters with all its train into the constellation of 
            Hercules. <br><br>
            
            We are on the eve of surprising Ialdabaoth in his palace of 
            porphyry, and you, who are burning to deliver the heavens, who were so 
            eager to enter in triumph into your emancipated country,—you suddenly 
            forget your noble purpose and fall asleep in the arms of the daughters of 
            men. <br><br>
            
            What pleasure can you find in intercourse with these unclean little 
            animals, composed, as they are, of elements so unstable that they may be 
            said to be in a state of constant evanescence? O Arcade! I was indeed right 
            to distrust you. <br><br>
            
            You are but an intellectual; you do but feel idle curiosity. <br><br>


            You are incapable of action."<br><br>
            
            
            "You misjudge me, Zita," replied the angel. <br><br>
            
            "It is the nature of the sons of 
            heaven to love the daughters of men. <br><br>
            
            Corruptible though it be, the material 
            part of women and of flowers charms the senses none the less. <br><br>
            
            But not one 
            of these little animals can make me forget my hatred and my love, and I am 
            ready to rise up against Ialdabaoth."<br><br>
            
            
            Zita expressed her satisfaction at seeing him in this resolute mood. <br><br>
            
            She 
            urged him to pursue the accomplishment of this vast undertaking with 
            undiminished ardour. <br><br>
            
            Nothing must be hurried or deferred. <br><br>


            "A great action, Arcade, is made up of a multitude of small ones; the most 
            majestic whole is composed of a thousand minute details. <br><br>
            
            Let us neglect 
            nothing."<br><br>
            
            
            She had come to take him to a meeting where his presence was required. <br><br>


            They were to take a census of the revolutionaries. <br><br>


            She added but one word: 
            "Nectaire will be there."<br><br>
            
            
            When Maurice saw Zita, he deemed her lacking in attraction. <br><br>
            
            She failed to 
            please him because she was perfectly beautiful and because true beauty 
            always caused him painful surprise. <br><br>
            
            Zita inspired him with antipathy when 
            he learned that she was an angel in revolt and that she had come to seek 
            Arcade to take him away among the conspirators. <br><br>


            The poor child tried to retain his companion by all the means that his wit 
            and the circumstances afforded him. <br><br>
            
            If his guardian angel would only 
            remain with him, he would take him to a magnificent boxing-match, to a 
            "revue" where he would witness the apotheosis of Poincaré, or, lastly, to a 
            certain house he knew of where he would behold women remarkable for 
            their beauty, talents, vices, or deformities. <br><br>
            
            But the angel would not allow 
            himself to be tempted, and said he was going with Zita. <br><br>


            "What for?" 
            "To plot the conquest of the skies."<br><br>
            
            
            "Still the same nonsense! The conquest of—— but there, I proved to you that 
            it was neither possible nor desirable."<br><br>
            
            
            "Good night, Maurice."<br><br>
            
            
            "You are going? Well, I will accompany you."<br><br>
            
            
            And Maurice, his arm in a sling, went with Arcade and Zita all the way to 
            Clodomir's restaurant at Montmartre, where the tables were laid in an 
            arbour in the garden. <br><br>


            Prince Istar and Théophile were already there, with a little creature who 
            looked like a child, and was, in fact, a Japanese angel. <br><br>


            "We are only waiting for Nectaire," said Zita. <br><br>


            And at that moment the old gardener noiselessly appeared. <br><br>
            
            He took his seat, 
            and his dog lay down at his feet. <br><br>
            
            French cooking is the best in the world. <br><br>
            
            It 
            is a glory that will transcend all others when humanity has grown wise 
            enough to put the spit above the sword. <br><br>
            
            Clodomir served the angels, and the 
            mortal who was with them, with a soup made of cabbages and bacon, a loin 
            of pork and kidneys cooked in wine, thereby proving himself a real 
            Montmartre cook, and showing that he had not been spoilt by the 
            Americans, who corrupt the most excellent chefs of the City of Restaurants. <br><br>


            Clodomir brought forth some Bordeaux, which, though unrecorded among 
            the renowned vintages of Médoc, gave evidence by its choice and delicate 
            aroma of the high nobility of its origin. <br><br>
            
            We must not omit to chronicle that, 
            after this wine and many others had been drunk, the cellarman, in solemn 
            state, produced a Burgundy choice and rare, full-bodied yet not heavy, 
            generous yet delicate, rich with the true Burgundian mellowness, a noble 
            and, withal, a somewhat heady wine, that brought delight alike to mind and 
            sense. <br><br>


            "Hail to thee, Dionysus, greatest of the Gods!" cried old Nectaire, raising his 
            glass on high. <br><br>
            
            "I drink to thee who wilt restore the Golden Age, and give 
            again to mortal men, who will become heroes as of old, the grapes which the 
            Lesbians used to cull, long since, from the vines of Methymna; who wilt 
            restore the vineyards of Thasus, the white clusters of Lake Mareotis, the 
            storehouses of Falernus, the vines of the Tmolus, and the wine of Phanae, of 
            all wines the king. <br><br>
            
            And the juice thereof shall be divine, and, as in old 
            Silenus' day, men shall grow drunk with Wisdom and with Love."<br><br>
            
            
            When the coffee was served, Prince Istar, Zita, Arcade, and the Japanese 
            angel took it in turns to give an account of the forces assembled against 
            Ialdabaoth. <br><br>
            
            Angels, in exchanging eternal bliss for the sufferings of an 
            earthly life, grow in intelligence, acquire the means of going astray and the 
            faculty of self-contradiction. <br><br>
            
            Consequently their meetings, like those of men, 
            are tumultuous and confused. <br><br>
            
            Did one of them deal in figures, the others 
            immediately called them in question. <br><br>
            
            They could not add one number to 
            another without quarrelling, and arithmetic itself, subjected to passion, lost 
            its certitude. <br><br>
            
            The Kerûb, who had brought with him the pious Théophile, 
            waxed indignant when he heard the musician praising the Lord, and rained 
            down such blows on his head as would have felled an ox. <br><br>
            
            But the head of a 
            musician is harder than a bucranium, and the blows which Théophile 
            received did not avail to modify that angel's notion of divine providence. <br><br>


            Arcade, having at great length set up his scientific idealism in opposition to 
            Zita's pragmatism, the beautiful archangel told him that he argued badly. <br><br>


            "And you are surprised at that!" exclaimed young Maurice's guardian angel. <br><br>


            "I argue, like you, in the language of human beings. <br><br>
            
            And what is human 
            language but the cry of the beasts of the forests or the mountains, 
            complicated and corrupted by arrogant anthropoids. <br><br>
            
            How then, Zita, can 
            one be expected to argue well with a collection of angry or plaintive sounds 
            like that? Angels do not reason at all; men, being superior to the angels, 
            reason imperfectly. <br><br>
            
            I will not mention the professors who think to define the 
            absolute with the aid of cries that they have inherited from the 
            pithecanthropoid monkeys, marsupials, and reptiles, their ancestors! It is a 
            colossal joke! How it would amuse the demiurge, if he had any brains!" 
            It was a beautiful starlight night. <br><br>
            
            The gardener was silent. <br><br>


            "Nectaire," said the beautiful archangel, "play to us on your flute, if you are 
            not afraid that the Earth and Heaven will be stirred to their depths thereby."<br><br>
            
            
            Nectaire took up his flute. <br><br>
            
            Young Maurice lighted a cigarette. <br><br>
            
            The flame 
            burnt brightly for a moment, casting back the sky and its stars into the 
            shadows, and then died out. <br><br>
            
            And Nectaire sang of the flame on his divine 
            flute. <br><br>
            
            The silvery voice soared aloft and sang: 
            "That flame was a whole universe which fulfilled its destiny in less than a 
            minute. <br><br>
            
            Suns and planets were formed therein. <br><br>
            
            Venus Urania apportioned 
            the orbits of the wandering spheres in those infinite spaces. <br><br>
            
            Beneath the 
            breath of Eros—the first of the gods,—plants, animals, and thoughts sprang 
            into being. <br><br>
            
            In the twenty seconds which hurried by betwixt the life and 
            death of those worlds, civilizations were unfolded, and empires sank in long 
            decline. <br><br>
            
            Mothers shed tears, and songs of love, cries of hatred, and sighs of 
            victims rose upward to the silent skies. <br><br>


            "In proportion to its minuteness, that universe lasted as long as this one—
            whereof we see a few atoms glittering above our heads—has lasted or will 
            last. <br><br>
            
            They are, one no less than the other, but a gleam in the Infinite."<br><br>
            
            
            As the clear, pure notes welled up into the charmed air, the earth melted 
            into a soft mist, the stars revolved rapidly in their orbits, the Great Bear fell 
            asunder, its parts flew far and wide. <br><br>
            
            Orion's belt was shattered; the Pole 
            Star forsook its magnetic axis. <br><br>
            
            Sirius, whose incandescent flame had lit up 
            the far horizon, grew blue, then red, flickered, and suddenly died out. <br><br>
            
            The 
            shaken constellations formed new signs which were extinguished in their 
            turn. <br><br>
            
            By its incantations the magic flute had compressed into one brief 
            moment the life and the movement of this universe which seems 
            unchanging and eternal both to men and angels. <br><br>
            
            It ceased, and the heavens 
            resumed their immemorial aspect. <br><br>
            
            Nectaire had vanished. <br><br>
            
            Clodomir asked 
            his guests if they were pleased with the cabbage soup which, in order that it 
            might be strong, had been kept simmering for twenty-four hours on the fire, 
            and he sang the praises of the Beaujolais which they had drunk. <br><br>


            The night was mild. <br><br>
            
            Arcade, accompanied by his guardian angel, Théophile, 
            Prince Istar, and the Japanese angel, escorted Zita home. <br><br>



          </p>


        <h2>Chapter 33</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">HOW A DREADFUL CRIME PLUNGES PARIS INTO A STATE OF TERROR</p>

        <p>
          HE city was asleep. Their footsteps rang loudly on the deserted pavement. <br><br>


          Having reached the corner of the Rue Feutrier, half-way up Montmartre, the 
          little company halted before the dwelling of the beautiful angel. <br><br>
          
          Arcade was 
          talking about the Thrones and Dominations with Zita, who, her finger on the 
          bell, could not make up her mind to ring. <br><br>
          
          Prince Istar was tracing the 
          mechanism of a new sort of bomb on the pavement with the end of his stick, 
          and bellowed so loudly that he woke the sleeping citizens and stirred into 
          activity the amatory passions of the neighbouring Pasiphaës. <br><br>
          
          Théophile was 
          singing the barcarole from the second act of Aline, Queen of Golconda at the 
          top of his voice. <br><br>
          
          Maurice, his arm in a sling, was fencing left-handed with 
          the Japanese, striking sparks from the pavement, and crying "A hit! a hit!" 
          in a piercing voice. <br><br>


          Meanwhile Inspector Grolle at the corner of the next street was dreaming. <br><br>


          He had the bearing of a Roman legionary and displayed all the 
          characteristics of that proudly servile race, who, ever since men first took to 
          building cities, have been the mainstay of Empires and the support of ruling 
          houses. <br><br>
          
          Inspector Grolle was very strong, but very tired. <br><br>
          
          He suffered from an 
          arduous profession and from lack of food. <br><br>
          
          He was a man devoted to duty, 
          but still a man, and he was unable to resist the wiles, the charms, and the 
          blandishments of the gay ladies whom he met in swarms in the shadows 
          along the empty streets and round about pieces of waste ground; he loved 
          them. <br><br>
          
          He loved like a soldier under arms. <br><br>
          
          It tired him, but courage 
          conquered fatigue. <br><br>
          
          Though he had not yet reached the middle of Life's way, 
          he longed for sweet repose and peaceful country pursuits. <br><br>
          
          At the corner of 
          the Rue Muller, on this mild night, he stood lost in thought. <br><br>
          
          He was 
          dreaming of the house where he was born, of the little olive wood, of his 
          father's bit of ground, of his old mother, bent with long and heavy labour, 
          whom he would never see again. <br><br>
          
          Roused from his reverie by the nocturnal 
          tumult, Inspector Grolle turned the corner of the street, and looked rather 
          unfavourably at the band of loiterers, wherein his social instinct suspected 
          enemies of law and order. <br><br>
          
          He was patient and resolute. <br><br>
          
          After a lengthy 
          silence, he said, with awe-inspiring calm: 
          "Move on, there!" 
          But Maurice and the Japanese angel were fencing and heard nothing. <br><br>
          
          The 
          musician heard nothing but his own melodies. <br><br>
          
          Prince Istar was absorbed in 
          the explanation of explosive formulæ. <br><br>
          
          Zita was discussing with Arcade the 
          greatest enterprise that had ever been conceived since the solar system 
          issued from its original nebula,—and thus they all remained unconscious of 
          their surroundings. <br><br>


          "Move on, I tell you!" repeated Inspector Grolle. <br><br>


          This time the angels heard the solemn word of warning, but either through 
          indifference or contempt, they neglected to obey, and continued their talk, 
          their songs, and their cries. <br><br>


          "So you want to be taken up, do you?" shouted Inspector Grolle, clapping 
          his great hand on Prince Istar's shoulder. <br><br>


          The Kerûb was indignant at this vile contact, and with one blow from his 
          formidable fist sent the Inspector flying into the gutter. <br><br>
          
          But Constable 
          Fesandet was already running to his comrade's aid, and they both fell upon 
          the Prince, whom they belaboured with mechanic fury, and whom, 
          notwithstanding his strength and weight, they would perchance have 
          dragged all bleeding to the police station, had not the Japanese angel 
          overset them one after the other without effort, and reduced them to 
          writhing and shrieking in the mud, before Maurice, Arcade, and Zita had 
          time to intervene. <br><br>
          
          As to the angelic musician, he stood apart trembling, and 
          invoked the heavens. <br><br>


          At this moment two bakers who were kneading their dough in a 
          neighbouring cellar ran out at the noise, in their white aprons, stripped to 
          the waist. <br><br>
          
          With an instinctive feeling for social solidarity they took the side 
          of the downfallen police. <br><br>
          
          Théophile conceived a just fear at the sight of them, 
          and fled away; they caught him and were about to hand him over to the 
          guardians of the peace, when Arcade and Zita tore him from their hands. <br><br>


          The fight continued, unequal and terrible, between the two angels and the 
          two bakers. <br><br>
          
          Like an athlete of Lysippus in strength and beauty, Arcade 
          smothered his heavy adversary in his arms. <br><br>
          
          The beautiful archangel drove 
          her dagger into the baker who had attacked her. <br><br>
          
          A dark stream of blood 
          flowed down over his hairy chest, and the two white-capped supporters of 
          the law sank to the ground. <br><br>


          Constable Fesandet had fainted face downwards in the gutter. <br><br>
          
          But Inspector 
          Grolle, who had got up, blew a blast on his whistle loud enough to be heard 
          at the neighbouring police-station, and sprang upon young Maurice, who, 
          having but one arm with which to defend himself, fired his revolver with his 
          left hand at the inspector, who put his hand to his heart, staggered, and 
          dropped down. <br><br>
          
          He gave a long sigh, and the shadows of eternity darkened 
          his eyes. <br><br>


          Meanwhile, windows opened one by one, and heads looked out on the street. <br><br>


          A sound of heavy steps approached. <br><br>
          
          Two policemen on bicycles debouched 
          upon the street. <br><br>
          
          Thereupon Prince Istar flung a bomb which shook the 
          ground, put out the gas, shattered some of the houses, and enveloped the 
          flight of young Maurice and the angels in a dense smoke. <br><br>


          Arcade and Maurice came to the conclusion that the safest thing to do after 
          this adventure was to return to the little flat in the Rue de Rome. <br><br>
          
          They 
          would certainly not be sought for immediately and probably not at all, the 
          bomb thrown by the Kerûb having fortunately wiped out all witnesses of the 
          affair. <br><br>
          
          They fell asleep towards dawn, and they had not yet awoke at ten 
          o'clock in the morning when the concierge brought their tea. <br><br>
          
          While eating 
          his toast and butter and slice of ham, young d'Esparvieu remarked to the 
          angel: 
          "I used to think that a murder was something very extraordinary. <br><br>
          
          Well, I was 
          mistaken. <br><br>
          
          It is the simplest, the most natural action in the world."<br><br>
          
          
          "And of most ancient tradition," replied the angel. <br><br>
          
          "For long centuries it was 
          both usual and necessary for man to kill and despoil his fellows. <br><br>
          
          It is still 
          recommended in warfare. <br><br>
          
          It is also honourable to attempt human life in 
          certain definite circumstances, and people approved when you wanted to 
          assassinate me, Maurice, because it appeared to you that I had been 
          intimate with your mistress. <br><br>
          
          But killing a police-inspector is not the action 
          of a man of fashion."<br><br>
          
          
          "Be silent," exclaimed Maurice, "be silent, scoundrel! I killed the poor 
          Inspector instinctively, not knowing what I was doing. <br><br>
          
          I am grieved to my 
          heart about it. <br><br>
          
          But it is not I, it is you who are the guilty one; you who are 
          the murderer. <br><br>
          
          It was you who lured me along this path of revolt and violence 
          which leads to the pit. <br><br>
          
          You have been my undoing. <br><br>
          
          You have sacrificed my 
          peace of mind, my happiness, to your pride and your wickedness, and all in 
          vain; for I warn you, Arcade, you will not succeed in what you are 
          undertaking."<br><br>
          
          
          The concierge brought in the newspapers. <br><br>
          
          On seeing them Maurice grew 
          pale. <br><br>
          
          They announced the outrage in the Rue de Ramey in huge headlines: 
          "An Inspector killed—Two cyclist policemen and two bakers seriously 
          wounded—Three houses blown up, numerous victims."<br><br>
          
          
          Maurice let the paper drop, and said in a weak, plaintive voice: 
          "Arcade, why did you not slay me in the little garden at Versailles amidst the 
          roses, to the song of the blackbirds?" 
          Meanwhile terror reigned in Paris. <br><br>
          
          In the public squares, and in the crowded 
          streets, house-wives, string-bag in hand, grew pale as they listened to the 
          story of the crime, and consigned the perpetrators to the most dreadful 
          punishment. <br><br>
          
          Shop-keepers, standing at the doors of their shops, put it all 
          down to the anarchists, syndicalists, socialists, and radicals, and demanded 
          that special measures should be taken against them. <br><br>


          The more thoughtful people recognized the handiwork of the Jew and the 
          German, and demanded the expulsion of all aliens. <br><br>
          
          Many vaunted the ways 
          of America and advocated lynching. <br><br>
          
          In addition to the printed news sinister 
          rumours became current. <br><br>
          
          Explosions had been heard at various places; 
          everywhere bombs had been discovered; everywhere individuals, taken for 
          malefactors, had been struck down by the popular arm and given up to 
          justice, torn to ribbons. <br><br>
          
          On the Place de la République a drunkard who was 
          crying "Down with the police" was torn to pieces by the crowd. <br><br>


          The President of the Council and Minister of Justice held long conferences 
          with the Prefect of Police, and they agreed to take immediate action. <br><br>
          
          In order 
          to allay the excitement of the Parisians, they arrested five or six hooligans 
          out of the thirty thousand which the Capital contains. <br><br>
          
          The chief of the 
          Russian police, believing he recognised in this attack the methods of the 
          Nihilists, demanded, on behalf of his Government, that a dozen refugees 
          should be given up. <br><br>
          
          The demand was immediately granted. <br><br>
          
          Proceedings were 
          also taken for certain individuals to be extradited to ensure the safety of the 
          King of Spain. <br><br>


          On learning of these energetic measures, Paris breathed once more, and the 
          evening papers congratulated the Government. <br><br>
          
          There was excellent news of 
          the wounded. <br><br>
          
          They were out of danger and identified as their assailants all 
          who were brought before them. <br><br>


          True, Inspector Grolle was dead; but two Sisters of Mercy kept vigil at his 
          side, and the President of the Council came and laid the Cross of Honour on 
          the breast of this victim of duty. <br><br>


          At night there were panics. <br><br>
          
          In the Avenue de la Révolte the police, noticing a 
          travelling acrobat's caravan on a piece of waste ground, took it for the 
          retreat of a band of robbers. <br><br>
          
          They whistled for help, and when they were a 
          goodly number, attacked the caravan. <br><br>
          
          Some worthy citizens joined them; 
          fifteen thousand revolver-shots were fired, the caravan was blown up with 
          dynamite, and among the débris they found the corpse of a monkey. <br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 34</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">WHICH CONTAINS AN ACCOUNT OF THE ARREST OF BOUCHOTTE AND 
          MAURICE, OF THE DISASTER WHICH BEFELL THE D'ESPARVIEU 
          LIBRARY, AND OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE ANGELS </p>

          <p>
            AURICE D'ESPARVIEU passed a terrible night. At the least sound he seized 
            his revolver that he might not fall alive into the hands of justice. <br><br>
            
            When 
            morning came he snatched the newspapers from the hands of the concierge, 
            devoured them greedily, and gave a cry of joy; he had just read that 
            Inspector Grolle having been taken to the Morgue for the post-mortem, the 
            police-surgeons had only discovered bruises and contusions of a very 
            superficial nature, and stated that death had been brought about by the 
            rupture of an aneurism of the aorta. <br><br>


            "You see, Arcade," he exclaimed triumphantly; "you see I am not an 
            assassin. <br><br>
            
            I am innocent. <br><br>
            
            I could never have imagined how extremely 
            agreeable it is to be innocent."<br><br>
            
            
            Then he grew thoughtful, and—no unusual phenomenon—reflection 
            dissipated his gaiety. <br><br>


            "I am innocent,—but there is no disguising the fact," he said, shaking his 
            head, "I am one of a band of malefactors. <br><br>
            
            I live with miscreants. <br><br>
            
            You are in 
            your right place there, Arcade, for you are deceitful, cruel, and perverse. <br><br>
            
            But 
            I come of good family and have received an excellent education, and I blush 
            for it."<br><br>
            
            
            "I also," said Arcade, "have received an excellent education."<br><br>
            
            
            "Where was that?" 
            "In Heaven."<br><br>
            
            
            "No, Arcade, no; you never had any education. <br><br>
            
            If good principles had been 
            inculcated into you, you would still hold them. <br><br>
            
            Such principles are never 
            lost. <br><br>
            
            In my childhood I learnt to revere my family, my country, my religion. <br><br>
            
            I 
            have not forgotten the lesson and I never shall. <br><br>
            
            Do you know what shocks 
            me most in you? It is not your perversity, your cruelty, your black 
            ingratitude; it is not your agnosticism, which may be borne with at a pinch; 
            it is not your scepticism, though it is very much out of date (for since the 
            national awakening there is no longer any scepticism in France);—no, what 
            disgusts me in you is your lack of taste, the bad style of your ideas, the 
            inelegance of your doctrines. <br><br>
            
            You think like an intellectual, you speak like a 
            freethinker, you have theories which reek of radicalism and Combeism and 
            all ignoble systems. <br><br>
            
            Get along with you! you disgust me. <br><br>
            
            Arcade, my old 
            friend, Arcade, my dear angel, Arcade, my beloved child, listen to your 
            guardian angel! Yield to my prayers, renounce your mad ideas; become 
            good, simple, innocent, and happy once more. <br><br>
            
            Put on your hat, come with 
            me to Nôtre-Dame. <br><br>
            
            We will say a prayer and burn a candle together."<br><br>
            
            
            Meanwhile public opinion was still active in the matter; the leading papers, 
            the organs of the national awakening, in articles of real elevation and real 
            depth, unravelled the philosophy of this monstrous attack which was 
            revolting to the conscience. <br><br>
            
            They discovered the real origin, the indirect but 
            effective cause in the revolutionary doctrines which had been disseminated 
            unchecked, in the weakening of social ties, the relaxing of moral discipline, 
            in the repeated appeals to every appetite, to every greedy desire. <br><br>
            
            It would be 
            needful, so as to cut down the evil at its root, to repudiate as quickly as 
            possible all such chimeras and Utopias as syndicalism, the income-tax, etc.,<br><br>
            
            
            etc.,<br><br>
            
            etc. <br><br>
            
             Many newspapers, and these not the least important, pointed out 
            that the recrudescence of crime was but the natural fruit of impiety and 
            concluded that the salvation of society lay in an unanimous and sincere 
            return to religion. <br><br>
            
            On the Sunday which followed the crime the 
            congregations in the churches were noticed to be unusually large. <br><br>


            Judge Salneuve, who was entrusted with the task of investigation, first 
            examined the persons arrested by the police, and lost his way among 
            attractive but illusory clues; however, the report of the detective 
            Montremain, which was laid before him, put him on the right road, and soon 
            led him to recognise the miscreants of La Jonchère as the authors of the 
            crime of the Rue de Ramey. <br><br>
            
            He ordered a search to be made for Arcade and 
            Zita, and issued a warrant against Prince Istar, on whom the detectives laid 
            hands as he was leaving Bouchotte's, where he had been depositing some 
            bombs of new design. <br><br>
            
            The Kerûb, on learning the detectives' intentions, 
            smiled broadly and asked them if they had a powerful motor-car. <br><br>
            
            On their 
            replying that they had one at the door, he assured them that was all he 
            wanted. <br><br>
            
            Thereupon he felled the two detectives on the stairs, walked up to 
            the waiting car, flung the chauffeur under a motor-'bus which was 
            opportunely passing, and seized the steering wheel under the eyes of the 
            terrified crowd. <br><br>


            That same evening Monsieur Jeancourt, the Police Magistrate, entered 
            Théophile's rooms just when Bouchotte was swallowing a raw egg to clear 
            her voice, for she was to sing her new song, "They haven't got any in 
            Germany," at the "National Eldorado" that evening. <br><br>
            
            The musician was 
            absent. <br><br>
            
            Bouchotte received the Magistrate, and received him with a hauteur 
            which intensified the simplicity of her attire; Bouchotte was en déshabille. <br><br>


            The worthy Magistrate seized the score of Aline, Queen of Golconda, and the 
            love-letters which the singer carefully preserved in the drawer of the table by 
            her bed, for she was an orderly young woman. <br><br>
            
            He was about to withdraw 
            when he espied a cupboard, which he opened with a careless air, and found 
            machines capable of blowing up half Paris, and a pair of large white wings, 
            whose nature and use appeared inexplicable to him. <br><br>
            
            Bouchotte was invited 
            to complete her toilette, and, in spite of her cries, was taken off to the police
            station. <br><br>


            Monsieur Salneuve was indefatigable. <br><br>
            
            After the examination of the papers 
            seized in Bouchotte's house, and acting on the information of Montremain, 
            he issued a warrant for the arrest of young d'Esparvieu, which was executed 
            on Wednesday, the 27th May, at seven o'clock in the morning, with great 
            discretion. <br><br>
            
            For three days Maurice had neither slept nor eaten, loved nor 
            lived. <br><br>
            
            He had not a moment's doubt as to the nature of the matutinal visit. <br><br>


            At the sight of the police magistrate a strange calm fell on him. <br><br>
            
            Arcade had 
            not returned to sleep in the flat. <br><br>
            
            Maurice begged the magistrate to wait for 
            him, dressed with care, and then accompanied the magistrate a calmness of 
            mind which was barely disturbed when the door of the Conciergerie closed 
            on him. <br><br>
            
            Alone in his cell, he climbed upon the table to look out. <br><br>
            
            His 
            tranquillity was due to his weariness of spirit, to his numbed senses, and to 
            the fact that he no longer stood in fear of arrest. <br><br>
            
            His misfortune endowed 
            him with superior wisdom. <br><br>
            
            He felt he had fallen into a state of grace. <br><br>
            
            He did 
            not think too highly or too humbly of himself, but left his cause in the hands 
            of God. <br><br>
            
            With no desire to cover up his faults, which he would not hide even 
            from himself, he addressed himself in mind to Providence, to point out that 
            if he had fallen into disorder and rebellion it was to lead his erring angel 
            back into the straight path. <br><br>
            
            He stretched himself on the couch and slept in 
            peace. <br><br>


            On hearing of the arrest of a music-hall singer and of a young man of 
            fashion, both Paris and the provinces felt painful surprise. <br><br>
            
            Deeply stirred by 
            the tragic accounts which the leading newspapers were bringing out, the 
            general idea was that the sort of people the authorities ought to bring to 
            justice were ferocious anarchists, all reeking and dripping from deeds of 
            blood and arson; but they failed to understand what the world of Art and 
            Fashion should have to do with such things. <br><br>
            
            At this news, which he was one 
            of the last to hear, the President of the Council and Keeper of the Seals 
            started up in his chair. <br><br>
            
            The Sphinxes that adorned it were less terrible than 
            he, and in the throes of his angry meditation he cut the mahogany of his 
            imperial table with his penknife, after the manner of Napoleon. <br><br>
            
            And when 
            Judge Salneuve, whose attendance he had commanded, appeared before 
            him, the President flung his penknife in the grate, as Louis XIV flung his 
            cane out of the window in the presence of Lauzun; and it cost him a 
            supreme effort to master himself and to say in a voice of suppressed fury: 
            "Are you mad? Surely I said often enough that I meant the plot to be 
            anarchist, anti-social, fundamentally anti-social and anti-governmental, 
            with a shade of syndicalism. <br><br>
            
            I have made it clear enough that I wanted it 
            kept within these lines; and what do you go and make of it?...<br><br>
            
             The 
            vengeance of anarchists and aspirants to freedom? Whom do you arrest? A 
            singer adored of the nationalist public, and the son of a man highly 
            esteemed in the Catholic party, who receives our bishops and has the entrée 
            to the Vatican; a man who may be one day sent as ambassador to the Pope. <br><br>


            At one blow you alienate one hundred and sixty Deputies and forty Senators 
            of the Right on the very eve of a motion to discuss the question of religious 
            pacification; you embroil me with my friends of to-day, with my friends of to
            morrow. <br><br>
            
            Was it to find out if you were in the same dilemma as des Aubels 
            that you seized the love-letters of young Maurice d'Esparvieu? I can put your 
            mind at rest on that point. <br><br>
            
            You are, and all Paris knows it. <br><br>
            
            But it is not to 
            avenge your personal affronts that you are on the Bench."<br><br>
            
            
            "Monsieur le Garde des Sceaux," murmured the Judge, nearly apoplectic 
            and in a choked voice. <br><br>
            
            "I am an honest man."<br><br>
            
            
            "You are a fool ... and a provincial. <br><br>
            
            Listen to me; if Maurice d'Esparvieu and 
            Mademoiselle Bouchotte are not released within half an hour I will crush 
            you like a piece of glass. <br><br>
            
            Be off!" 
            Monsieur René d'Esparvieu went himself to fetch his son from the 
            Conciergerie and took him back to the old house in the Rue Garancière. <br><br>
            
            The 
            return was triumphant. <br><br>
            
            The news had been disseminated that Maurice had 
            with generous imprudence interested himself in an attempt to restore the 
            monarchy, and that Judge Salneuve, the infamous freemason, the tool of 
            Combes and André, had tried to compromise the young man by making him 
            out to be an accomplice of a band of criminals. <br><br>


            That was what Abbé Patouille seemed to think, and he answered for Maurice 
            as for himself. <br><br>
            
            It was known, moreover, that breaking with his father, who 
            had rallied to the support of the Republic, young d'Esparvieu was on the 
            high road to becoming an out-and-out Royalist. <br><br>
            
            The people who had an 
            inside knowledge of things saw in his arrest the vengeance of the Jews. <br><br>
            
            Was 
            not Maurice a notorious anti-Semite? Catholic youths went forth to hurl 
            imprecations at Judge Salneuve under the windows of his residence in the 
            Rue Guénégaud, opposite the Mint. <br><br>


            On the Boulevard du Palais a band of students presented Maurice with a 
            branch of palm. <br><br>
            
            Maurice made a charming reply. <br><br>


            Maurice was overcome with emotion when he beheld the old house in which 
            his childhood had been spent, and fell weeping into his mother's arms. <br><br>


            It was a great day, unhappily marred by one painful incident. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur 
            Sariette, who had lost his reason as a consequence of the shocking events 
            that had taken place in the Rue de Courcelles, had suddenly become violent. <br><br>


            He had shut himself up in the library, and there he had remained for 
            twenty-four hours, uttering the most horrible cries, and, turning a deaf ear 
            alike to threats and entreaties, refused to come out. <br><br>
            
            He had spent the night 
            in a condition of extreme restlessness, for all night long the lamp had been 
            seen passing rapidly to and fro behind the curtains. <br><br>
            
            In the morning, hearing 
            Hippolyte shouting to him from the court below, he opened the window of 
            the Hall of the Spheres and the Philosophers, and heaved two or three 
            rather weighty tomes on to the old valet's head. <br><br>
            
            The whole of the domestic 
            staff—men, women, and boys—hurried to the spot, and the librarian 
            proceeded to throw out books by the armful on to their heads. <br><br>
            
            In view of the 
            gravity of the situation, Monsieur René d'Esparvieu did not disdain to 
            intervene. <br><br>
            
            He appeared in night-cap and dressing-gown, and attempted to 
            reason with the poor lunatic, whose only reply was to pour forth torrents of 
            abuse on the man whom till then he had worshipped as his benefactor, and 
            to endeavour to crush him beneath all the Bibles, all the Talmuds, all the 
            sacred books of India and Persia, all the Greek Fathers, and all the Latin 
            Fathers, Saint John Chrysostom, Saint Gregory Nazianzen, Saint Augustine, 
            Saint Jerome, all the apologists, ay! and under the Histoire des Variations, 
            annotated by Bossuet himself! Octavos, quartos, folios came crashing down, 
            and lay in a sordid heap on the courtyard pavement. <br><br>
            
            The letters of Gassendi, 
            of Père Mersenne, of Pascal, were blown about hither and thither by the 
            wind. <br><br>
            
            The lady's-maid who had stooped down to rescue some of the sheets 
            from the gutter got a blow on the head from an enormous Dutch atlas. <br><br>


            Madame René d'Esparvieu had been terrified by the ominous sounds, and 
            appeared on the scene without waiting to apply the finishing touches of 
            powder and paint. <br><br>
            
            When he caught sight of her, old Sariette became more 
            violent than ever. <br><br>
            
            Down they came one after another as hard as he could 
            pelt them; the busts of the poets, philosophers, and historians of antiquity—
            Homer, Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Herodotus, Thucydides, Socrates, 
            Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Seneca, Epictetus—all 
            lay scattered on the ground. <br><br>
            
            The celestial sphere and the terrestrial globe 
            descended with a terrifying crash that was followed by a ghastly hush, 
            broken only by the shrill laughter of little Léon, who was looking down on 
            the scene from a window above. <br><br>
            
            A locksmith having opened the library door, 
            all the household hastened to enter, and found the aged Sariette entrenched 
            behind piles of books, busily engaged in tearing and slashing away at the 
            Lucretius of the Prior de Vendôme annotated in Voltaire's own hand. <br><br>
            
            They 
            had to force a way through the barricade. <br><br>
            
            But the maniac, perceiving that 
            his stronghold was being invaded, fled away and escaped on to the roof. <br><br>
            
            For 
            two whole hours he gave vent to shouts and yells that were heard far and 
            wide. <br><br>
            
            In the Rue Garancière the crowd kept growing bigger and bigger. <br><br>
            
            All 
            had their eyes fixed on the unhappy creature, and whenever he stumbled on 
            the slates, which cracked beneath him, they gave a shout of terror. <br><br>
            
            In the 
            midst of the crowd, the Abbé Patouille, who expected every moment to see 
            him hurled into space, was reciting the prayers for the dying, and making 
            ready to give him the absolution in extremis. <br><br>
            
            There was a cordon of police 
            round the house keeping order. <br><br>
            
            Someone summoned the fire-brigade, and 
            the sound of their approach was soon heard. <br><br>
            
            They placed a ladder against 
            the wall of the house, and after a terrific struggle managed to secure the 
            maniac, who in the course of his desperate resistance had one of the 
            muscles of his arm torn out. <br><br>
            
            He was immediately removed to an asylum. <br><br>


            Maurice dined at home, and there were smiles of tenderness and affection 
            when Victor, the old butler, brought on the roast veal. <br><br>
            
            Monsieur l'Abbé 
            Patouille sat at the right hand of the Christian mother, unctuously 
            contemplating the family which Heaven had so plentifully blessed. <br><br>


            Nevertheless, Madame d'Esparvieu was ill at ease. <br><br>
            
            Every day she received 
            anonymous letters of so insulting and coarse a nature that she thought at 
            first they must come from a discharged footman. <br><br>
            
            She now knew they were 
            the handiwork of her youngest daughter, Berthe, a mere child! Little Léon, 
            too, gave her pain and anxiety. <br><br>
            
            He paid no attention to his lessons, and was 
            given to bad habits. <br><br>
            
            He showed a cruel disposition. <br><br>
            
            He had plucked his 
            sister's canaries alive; he stuck innumerable pins into the chair on which 
            Mademoiselle Caporal was accustomed to sit, and had stolen fourteen francs 
            from the poor girl, who did nothing but cry and dab her eyes and nose from 
            morning till night. <br><br>


            No sooner was dinner over than Maurice rushed off to the little dwelling in 
            the Rue de Rome, impatient to meet his angel again. <br><br>
            
            Through the door he 
            heard a loud sound of voices, and saw assembled in the room where the 
            apparition had taken place, Arcade, Zita, the angelic musician, and the 
            Kerûb, who was lying on the bed, smoking a huge pipe, carelessly scorching 
            pillows, sheets, and coverlets. <br><br>
            
            They embraced Maurice, and announced their 
            departure. <br><br>
            
            Their faces shone with happiness and courage. <br><br>
            
            Alone, the 
            inspired author of Aline, Queen of Golconda, shed tears and raised his 
            terrified gaze to heaven. <br><br>
            
            The Kerûb forced him into the party of rebellion by 
            setting before him two alternatives: either to allow himself to be dragged 
            from prison to prison on earth, or to carry fire and sword into the palace of 
            Ialdabaoth. <br><br>


            Maurice perceived with sorrow that the earth had scarcely any hold over 
            them. <br><br>
            
            They were setting out filled with immense hope, which was quite 
            justifiable. <br><br>
            
            Doubtless they were but a few combatants to oppose the 
            innumerable soldiers of the sultan of the heavens; but they counted on 
            compensating for the inferiority of their numbers by the irresistible impetus 
            of a sudden attack. <br><br>
            
            They were not ignorant of the fact that Ialdabaoth, who 
            flatters himself on knowing all things, sometimes allows himself to be taken 
            by surprise. <br><br>
            
            And it certainly looked as if the first attack would have taken 
            him unawares had it not been for the warning of the archangel Michael. <br><br>
            
            The 
            celestial army had made no progress since its victory over the rebels before 
            the beginning of Time. <br><br>


            As regards armaments and material it was as out of date as the army of the 
            Moors. <br><br>
            
            Its generals slumbered in sloth and ignorance. <br><br>
            
            Loaded with honours 
            and riches, they preferred the delights of the banquet to the fatigues of war. <br><br>


            Michael, the commander-in-chief, ever loyal and brave, had lost, with the 
            passing of centuries, his fire and enthusiasm. <br><br>
            
            The conspirators of 1914, on 
            the other hand, knew the very latest and the most delicate appliances of 
            science for the art of destruction. <br><br>
            
            At length all was ready and decided upon. <br><br>


            The army of revolt, assembled by corps each a hundred thousand angels 
            strong, on all the waste places of the earth—steppes, pampas, deserts, fields 
            of ice and snow—was ready to launch itself against the sky. <br><br>
            
            The angels, in 
            modifying the rhythm of the atoms of which they are composed, are able to 
            traverse the most varied mediums. <br><br>
            
            Spirits that have descended on to the 
            earth, being formed, since their incarnation, of too compact a substance, 
            can no longer fly of themselves, and to rise into ethereal regions and then 
            insensibly grow volatilized, have need of the assistance of their brothers, 
            who, though revolutionaries like themselves, nevertheless, stayed behind in 
            the Empyrean and remained, not immaterial (for all is matter in the 
            Universe), but gloriously untrammelled and diaphanous. <br><br>
            
            Certes, it was not 
            without painful anxiety that Arcade, Istar, and Zita prepared themselves to 
            pass from the heavy atmosphere of the earth to the limpid depths of the 
            heavens. <br><br>
            
            To plunge into the ether there is need to expend such energy that 
            the most intrepid hesitate to take flight. <br><br>
            
            Their very substance, while 
            penetrating this fine medium, must in itself grow fine-spun, become 
            vaporised, and pass from human dimensions to the volume of the vastest 
            clouds which have ever enveloped the earth. <br><br>
            
            Soon they would surpass in 
            grandeur the uttermost planets, whose orbits they, invisible and 
            imponderable, would traverse without disturbing. <br><br>


            In this enterprise—the vastest that angels could undertake—their substance 
            would be ultimately hotter than the fire and colder than the ice, and they 
            would suffer pangs sharper than death. <br><br>


            Maurice read all the daring and the pain of the undertaking in the eyes of 
            Arcade. <br><br>


            "You are going?" he said to him, weeping. <br><br>


            "We are going, with Nectaire, to seek the great archangel to lead us to 
            victory."<br><br>
            
            
            "Whom do you call thus?" 
            "The priests of the demiurge have made him known to you in their 
            calumnies."<br><br>
            
            
            "Unhappy being," sighed Maurice. <br><br>


            Arcade embraced him, and Maurice felt the angel's tears as they dropped 
            upon his cheek.
<br><br>

        <h2>Chapter 35</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">AND LAST, WHEREIN THE SUBLIME DREAM OF SATAN IS UNFOLDED</p>


        <p>
          CLIMBING the seven steep terraces which rise up from the bed of the 
          Ganges to the temples muffled in creepers, the five angels reached, by half
          obliterated paths, the wild garden filled with perfumed clusters of grapes 
          and chattering monkeys, and, at the far end thereof, they discovered him 
          whom they had come to seek. <br><br>
          
          The archangel lay with his elbow on black 
          cushions embroidered with golden flames. <br><br>
          
          At his feet crouched lions and 
          gazelles. <br><br>
          
          Twined in the trees, tame serpents turned on him their friendly 
          gaze. <br><br>
          
          At the sight of his angelic visitors his face grew melancholy. <br><br>
          
          Long 
          since, in the days when, with his brow crowned with grapes and his sceptre 
          of vine-leaves in his hand, he had taught and comforted mankind, his heart 
          had many times been heavy with sorrow; but never yet, since his glorious 
          downfall, had his beautiful face expressed such pain and anguish. <br><br>

          
          Zita told him of the black standards assembled in crowds in all the waste 
          places of the globe; of the deliverance premeditated and prepared in the 
          provinces of Heaven, where the first revolt had long ago been fomented. <br><br>

          
          "Prince," she went on, "your army awaits you. <br><br>
          
          Come, lead it on to victory."<br><br>
          
          
          "Friends," replied the great archangel, "I was aware of the object of your 
          visit. <br><br>
          
          Baskets of fruit and honeycombs await you under the shade of this 
          mighty tree. <br><br>
          
          The sun is about to descend into the roseate waters of the 
          Sacred River. <br><br>
          
          When you have eaten, you will slumber pleasantly in this 
          garden, where the joys of the intellect and of the senses have reigned since 
          the day when I drove hence the spirit of the old Demiurge. <br><br>
          
          To-morrow I will 
          give you my answer."<br><br>
          
          
          Night hung its blue over the garden. <br><br>
          
          Satan fell asleep. <br><br>
          
          He had a dream, and 
          in that dream, soaring over the earth, he saw it covered with angels in 
          revolt, beautiful as gods, whose eyes darted lightning. <br><br>
          
          And from pole to pole 
          one single cry, formed of a myriad cries, mounted towards him, filled with 
          hope and love. <br><br>
          
          And Satan said: 
          "Let us go forth! Let us seek the ancient adversary in his high abode."<br><br>
          
          And 
          he led the countless host of angels over the celestial plains. <br><br>
          
          And Satan was 
          cognizant of what took place in the heavenly citadel. <br><br>
          
          When news of this 
          second revolt came thither, the Father said to the Son: 
          "The irreconcilable foe is rising once again. <br><br>
          
          Let us take heed to ourselves, 
          and in this, our time of danger, look to our defences, lest we lose our high 
          abode."<br><br>
          
          
          And the Son, consubstantial with the Father, replied: 
          "We shall triumph under the sign that gave Constantine the victory."<br><br>
          
          
          Indignation burst forth on the Mountain of God. <br><br>
          
          At first the faithful 
          Seraphim condemned the rebels to terrible torture, but afterwards decided 
          on doing battle with them. <br><br>
          
          The anger burning in the hearts of all inflamed 
          each countenance. <br><br>
          
          They did not doubt of victory, but treachery was feared, 
          and eternal darkness had been at once decreed for spies and alarmists. <br><br>

          
          There was shouting and singing of ancient hymns and praise of the 
          Almighty. <br><br>
          
          They drank of the mystic wine. <br><br>
          
          Courage, over-inflated, came near 
          to giving way, and a secret anxiety stole into the inner depths of their souls. <br><br>

          
          The archangel Michael took supreme command. <br><br>
          
          He reassured their minds 
          by his serenity. <br><br>
          
          His countenance, wherein his soul was visible, expressed 
          contempt for danger. <br><br>
          
          By his orders, the chiefs of the thunderbolts, the 
          Kerûbs, grown dull with the long interval of peace, paced with heavy steps 
          the ramparts of the Holy Mountain, and, letting the gaze of their bovine eyes 
          wander over the glittering clouds of their Lord, strove to place the divine 
          batteries in position. <br><br>
          
          After inspecting the defences, they swore to the Most 
          High that all was in readiness. <br><br>
          
          They took counsel together as to the plan 
          they should follow. <br><br>
          
          Michael was for the offensive. <br><br>
          
          He, as a consummate 
          soldier, said it was the supreme law. <br><br>
          
          Attack, or be attacked,—there was no 
          middle course. <br><br>

          
          "Moreover," he added, "the offensive attitude is particularly suitable to the 
          ardour of the Thrones and Dominations."<br><br>
          
          
          Beyond that, it was impossible to obtain a word from the valiant chief, and 
          this silence seemed the mark of a genius sure of himself. <br><br>

          
          As soon as the approach of the enemy was announced, Michael sent forth 
          three armies to meet them, commanded by the archangels Uriel, Raphael, 
          and Gabriel. <br><br>
          
          Standards, displaying all the colours of the Orient, were 
          unfurled above the ethereal plains, and the thunders rolled over the starry 
          floors. <br><br>
          
          For three days and three nights was the lot of the terrible and 
          adorable armies unknown on the Mountain of God. <br><br>
          
          Towards dawn on the 
          fourth day news came, but it was vague and confused. <br><br>
          
          There were rumours 
          of indecisive victories; of the triumph now of this side, now of that. <br><br>
          
          There 
          came reports of glorious deeds which were dissipated in a few hours. <br><br>

          
          The thunderbolts of Raphael, hurled against the rebels, had, it was said, 
          consumed entire squadrons. <br><br>
          
          The troops commanded by the impure Zita 
          were thought to have been swallowed up in the whirlwind of a tempest of 
          fire. <br><br>
          
          It was believed that the savage Istar had been flung headlong into the 
          gulf of perdition so suddenly that the blasphemies begun in his mouth had 
          been forced backwards with explosive results. <br><br>
          
          It was popularly supposed 
          that Satan, laden with chains of adamant, had been plunged once again into 
          the abyss. <br><br>
          
          Meanwhile, the commanders of the three armies had sent no 
          messages. <br><br>
          
          Mutterings and murmurs, mingling with the rumours of glory, 
          gave rise to fears of an indecisive battle, a precipitate retreat. <br><br>
          
          Insolent voices 
          gave out that a spirit of the lowest category, a guardian angel, the 
          insignificant Arcade, had checked and routed the dazzling host of the three 
          great archangels. <br><br>

          
          There were also rumours of wholesale defection in the Seventh Heaven, 
          where rebellion had broken out before the beginning of Time, and some had 
          even seen black clouds of impious angels joining the armies of the rebels on 
          Earth. <br><br>
          
          But no one lent an ear to the odious rumours, and stress was laid on 
          the news of victory which ran from lip to lip, each statement readily finding 
          confirmation. <br><br>
          
          The high places resounded with hymns of joy; the Seraphim 
          celebrated on harp and psaltery Sabaoth, God of Thunder. <br><br>
          
          The voices of the 
          elect united with those of the angels in glorifying the Invisible and at the 
          thought of the bloodshed that the ministers of holy wrath had caused 
          among the rebels, sighs of relief and jubilation were wafted from the 
          Heavenly Jerusalem towards the Most High. <br><br>
          
          But the beatitude of the most 
          blessed, having swelled to the utmost limit before due time, could increase 
          no more, and the very excess of their felicity completely dulled their senses. <br><br>

          
          The songs had not yet ceased when the guards watching on the ramparts 
          signalled the approach of the first fugitives of the divine army; Seraphim on 
          tattered wing, flying in disorder, maimed Kerûbs going on three feet. <br><br>
          
          With 
          impassive gaze, Michael, prince of warriors, measured the extent of the 
          disaster, and his keen intelligence penetrated its causes. <br><br>
          
          The armies of the 
          living God had taken the offensive, but by one of those fatalities in war 
          which disconcert the plans of the greatest captains, the enemy had also 
          taken the offensive, and the effect was evident. <br><br>
          
          Scarcely were the gates of 
          the citadel opened to receive the glorious but shattered remnants of the 
          three armies, when a rain of fire fell on the Mountain of God. <br><br>
          
          Satan's army 
          was not yet in sight, but the walls of topaz, the cupolas of emerald, the roofs 
          of diamond, all fell in with an appalling crash under the discharge of the 
          electrophores. <br><br>
          
          The ancient thunderclouds essayed to reply, but the bolts fell 
          short, and their thunders were lost in the deserted plains of the skies. <br><br>

          
          Smitten by an invisible foe, the faithful angels abandoned the ramparts. <br><br>

          
          Michael went to announce to his God that the Holy Mountain would fall into 
          the hands of the demon in twenty-four hours, and that nothing remained for 
          the Master of the Heavens but to seek safety in flight. <br><br>
          
          The Seraphim placed 
          the jewels of the celestial crown in coffers. <br><br>
          
          Michael offered his arm to the 
          Queen of Heaven, and the Holy Family escaped from the palace by a 
          subterranean passage of porphyry. <br><br>
          
          A deluge of fire was falling on the citadel. <br><br>

          
          Regaining his post once more, the glorious archangel declared that he would 
          never capitulate, and straightway advanced the standards of the living God. <br><br>

          
          That same evening the rebel host made its entry into the thrice-sacred city. <br><br>

          
          On a fiery steed Satan led his demons. <br><br>
          
          Behind him marched Arcade, Istar, 
          and Zita. <br><br>
          
          As in the ancient revels of Dionysus, old Nectaire bestrode his ass. <br><br>

          
          Thereafter, floating out far behind, followed the black standards. <br><br>

          
          The garrison laid down their arms before Satan. <br><br>
          
          Michael placed his flaming 
          sword at the feet of the conquering archangel. <br><br>

          
          "Take back your sword, Michael," said Satan. <br><br>
          
          "It is Lucifer who yields it to 
          you. <br><br>
          
          Bear it in defence of peace and law."<br><br>
          
          Then letting his gaze fall on the 
          leaders of the celestial cohorts, he cried in a ringing voice: 
          "Archangel Michael, and you, Powers, Thrones, and Dominations, swear all 
          of you to be faithful to your God."<br><br>
          
          
          "We swear it," they replied with one voice. <br><br>

          
          And Satan said: 
          "Powers, Thrones, and Dominations, of all past wars, I wish but to 
          remember the invincible courage that you displayed and the loyalty which 
          you rendered to authority, for these assure me of the steadfastness of the 
          fealty you have just sworn to me."<br><br>
          
          
          The following day, on the ethereal plain, Satan commanded the black 
          standards to be distributed to the troops, and the winged soldiers covered 
          them with kisses and bedewed them with tears. <br><br>

          
          And Satan had himself crowned God. <br><br>
          
          Thronging round the glittering walls of 
          Heavenly Jerusalem, apostles, pontiffs, virgins, martyrs, confessors, the 
          whole company of the elect, who during the fierce battle had enjoyed 
          delightful tranquillity, tasted infinite joy in the spectacle of the coronation. <br><br>

          
          The elect saw with ravishment the Most High precipitated into Hell, and 
          Satan seated on the throne of the Lord. <br><br>
          
          In conformity with the will of God 
          which had cut them off from sorrow they sang in the ancient fashion the 
          praises of their new Master. <br><br>

          
          And Satan, piercing space with his keen glance, contemplated the little globe 
          of earth and water where of old he had planted the vine and formed the first 
          tragic chorus. <br><br>
          
          And he fixed his gaze on that Rome where the fallen God had 
          founded his empire on fraud and lie. <br><br>
          
          Nevertheless, at that moment a saint 
          ruled over the Church. <br><br>
          
          Satan saw him praying and weeping. <br><br>
          
          And he said to 
          him: 
          "To thee I entrust my Spouse. <br><br>
          
          Watch over her faithfully. <br><br>
          
          In thee I confirm the 
          right and power to decide matters of doctrine, to regulate the use of the 
          sacraments, to make laws and to uphold purity of morals. <br><br>
          
          And the faithful 
          shall be under obligation to conform thereto. <br><br>
          
          My Church is eternal, and the 
          gates of hell shall not prevail against it. <br><br>
          
          Thou art infallible. <br><br>
          
          Nothing is 
          changed."<br><br>
          
          
          And the successor of the apostles felt flooded with rapture. <br><br>
          
          He prostrated 
          himself, and with his forehead touching the floor, replied: 
          "O Lord, my God, I recognise Thy voice! Thy breath has been wafted like 
          balm to my heart. <br><br>
          
          Blessed be Thy name. <br><br>
          
          Thy will be done on Earth, as it is 
          in Heaven. <br><br>
          
          Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."<br><br>
          
          
          And Satan found pleasure in praise and in the exercise of his grace; he loved 
          to hear his wisdom and his power belauded. <br><br>
          
          He listened with joy to the 
          canticles of the cherubim who celebrated his good deeds, and he took no 
          pleasure in listening to Nectaire's flute, because it celebrated nature's self, 
          yielded to the insect and to the blade of grass their share of power and love, 
          and counselled happiness and freedom. <br><br>
          
          Satan, whose flesh had crept, in 
          days gone by, at the idea that suffering prevailed in the world, now felt 
          himself inaccessible to pity. <br><br>
          
          He regarded suffering and death as the happy 
          results of omnipotence and sovereign kindness. <br><br>
          
          And the savour of the blood 
          of victims rose upward towards him like sweet incense. <br><br>
          
          He fell to 
          condemning intelligence and to hating curiosity. <br><br>
          
          He himself refused to learn 
          anything more, for fear that in acquiring fresh knowledge he might let it be 
          seen that he had not known everything at the very outset. <br><br>
          
          He took pleasure 
          in mystery, and believing that he would seem less great by being 
          understood, he affected to be unintelligible. <br><br>
          
          Dense fumes of Theology filled 
          his brain. <br><br>
          
          One day, following the example of his predecessor, he conceived 
          the notion of proclaiming himself one god in three persons. <br><br>
          
          Seeing Arcade 
          smile as this proclamation was made, he drove him from his presence. <br><br>
          
          Istar 
          and Zita had long since returned to earth. <br><br>
          
          Thus centuries passed like 
          seconds. <br><br>
          
          Now, one day, from the altitude of his throne, he plunged his gaze 
          into the depths of the pit and saw Ialdabaoth in the Gehenna where he 
          himself had long lain enchained. <br><br>
          
          Amid the everlasting gloom Ialdabaoth still 
          retained his lofty mien. <br><br>
          
          Blackened and shattered, terrible and sublime, he 
          glanced upwards at the palace of the King of Heaven with a look of proud 
          disdain, then turned away his head. <br><br>
          
          And the new god, as he looked upon his 
          foe, beheld the light of intelligence and love pass across his sorrow-stricken 
          countenance. <br><br>
          
          And lo! Ialdabaoth was now contemplating the Earth and, 
          seeing it sunk in wickedness and suffering, he began to foster thoughts of 
          kindliness in his heart. <br><br>
          
          On a sudden he rose up, and beating the ether with 
          his mighty arms, as though with oars, he hastened thither to instruct and to 
          console mankind. <br><br>
          
          Already his vast shadow shed upon the unhappy planet a 
          shade soft as a night of love. <br><br>

          
          And Satan awoke bathed in an icy sweat. <br><br>

          
          Nectaire, Istar, Arcade, and Zita were standing round him. <br><br>
          
          The finches were 
          singing. <br><br>

          
          "Comrades," said the great archangel, "no—we will not conquer the heavens. <br><br>

          
          Enough to have the power. <br><br>
          
          War engenders war, and victory defeat. <br><br>

          
          "God, conquered, will become Satan; Satan, conquering, will become God. <br><br>

          
          May the fates spare me this terrible lot; I love the Hell which formed my 
          genius. <br><br>
          
          I love the Earth where I have done some good, if it be possible to do 
          any good in this fearful world where beings live but by rapine. <br><br>
          
          Now, thanks 
          to us, the god of old is dispossessed of his terrestrial empire, and every 
          thinking being on this globe disdains him or knows him not. <br><br>
          
          But what 
          matter that men should be no longer submissive to Ialdabaoth if the spirit of 
          Ialdabaoth is still in them; if they, like him, are jealous, violent, 
          quarrelsome, and greedy, and the foes of the arts and of beauty? What 
          matter that they have rejected the ferocious Demiurge, if they do not 
          hearken to the friendly demons who teach all truths; to Dionysus, Apollo, 
          and the Muses? As to ourselves, celestial spirits, sublime demons, we have 
          destroyed Ialdabaoth, our Tyrant, if in ourselves we have destroyed 
          Ignorance and Fear."<br><br>
          
          
          And Satan, turning to the gardener, said: 
          "Nectaire, you fought with me before the birth of the world. <br><br>
          
          We were 
          conquered because we failed to understand that Victory is a Spirit, and that 
          it is in ourselves and in ourselves alone that we must attack and destroy 
          Ialdabaoth."<br><br>
