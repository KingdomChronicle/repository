          <h2>Revelation 21:3-4</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>

          <p><sup>3</sup> And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. <sup>4</sup> He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” </p>

          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

          <p class="chapterTitle" style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>The Story of Salvation (God’s Redemptive Plan)</b></p>
          <p class="chapterTitle" style="color: #008000;"><b>Eternal Life: God's Forever Home for Us
        </b></p>

          <p>
            Have you ever gone on a trip and stayed in a really nice place? Maybe it was a fun vacation or a sleepover at a friend’s house. Now imagine the most beautiful, happiest place ever—a place where there is no sadness, no pain, and no goodbyes. That’s what Heaven is like! <br><br>

            In John 14:2-3, Jesus said something amazing to His friends: “In my Father’s house are many rooms… I go to prepare a place for you… I will come back and take you to be with me.”<br><br>

            Jesus was talking about Heaven, a real place where He lives and where everyone who believes in Him will go one day. He said He’s getting it ready just for us! That means you and me have a special place in God’s forever home.<br><br>

            And guess what? In Revelation 21:4, the Bible tells us what Heaven will be like:  “He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain.”<br><br>

            Isn’t that incredible? In Heaven, there won’t be any sickness, fear, or sadness. There won’t be any more goodbyes. Everything will be new, perfect, and full of joy! We will be with God forever, and we’ll never be lonely or hurt again.<br><br>

            Eternal life means living forever with Jesus. It begins when we trust in Him and accept Him into our hearts. Even though our time on earth has an end, our time with Jesus never ends. It goes on forever in the most amazing place we could imagine.<br><br>

            So, when life gets hard or scary, remember that Jesus has something wonderful waiting for you. Heaven is real, and God wants you to be there with Him. Trust in Jesus, follow Him, and one day, you’ll see that beautiful place with your own eyes!
