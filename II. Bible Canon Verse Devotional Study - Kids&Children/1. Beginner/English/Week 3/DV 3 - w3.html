          <p class="chapterTitle" style="color: #008000;"><b>The Cross and Resurrection: The Greatest Story Ever Told</b></p>

          <p>
            Have you ever heard about the greatest act of love in the whole world? It happened over 2,000 years ago, and it’s still changing lives today. It’s the story of Jesus, the cross, and the resurrection. <br><br>

            In 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, the Bible says, “Christ died for our sins… He was buried, and He was raised on the third day.” These verses tell us the heart of the Good News.<br><br>

            Jesus, who never did anything wrong, chose to die on a cross for us. Why? Because He loves us so much and wanted to take the punishment for all the wrong things people do—like lying, being mean, or disobeying. He didn’t want sin to keep us away from God. So, Jesus took our place on the cross. That’s how much He cares about each one of us.<br><br>

            But the story doesn’t end there!<br><br>

            After Jesus died, He was buried in a tomb. Everyone thought it was over. But on the third day, something amazing happened—Jesus came back to life! He rose from the dead! This is called the resurrection, and it proves that Jesus has power over sin, death, and anything we could ever face.<br><br>

            Because Jesus is alive, we can have hope, joy, and a forever friendship with God. The cross shows His love, and the resurrection shows His power.<br><br>

            So whenever you feel afraid, lost, or unsure, remember: Jesus died for you and rose again. He’s alive today, and He wants to live in your heart and be with you forever.
