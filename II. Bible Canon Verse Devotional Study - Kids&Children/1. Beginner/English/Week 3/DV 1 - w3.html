          <h2>Genesis 3:15</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>

          <p><sup>15</sup>I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel. </p>

          <p class="chapterTitle" style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>The Story of Salvation (God’s Redemptive Plan)</b></p>
          <p class="chapterTitle" style="color: #008000;"><b>The Promise of a Savior</b></p>

          <p>
            A long, long time ago, at the very beginning of the world, God created a beautiful garden called Eden. He filled it with colorful flowers, tall trees, singing birds, and peaceful animals. God made the first man and woman—Adam and Eve—to live in that garden and take care of it. They were happy because they walked with God and had everything they needed.
            <br><br>

            <b>But something went wrong.</b><br><br>

            One day, a sneaky snake—Satan in disguise—tricked Eve into eating the one fruit God told them not to eat. Adam did the same. Because of that choice, sin entered the world. It was a very sad day. Adam and Eve had to leave the garden, and pain, sadness, and death came into the world.<br><br>

            <b>But God didn’t leave them without hope.</b><br><br>

            Right then and there, God made a promise. In Genesis 3:15, God spoke to the snake and said, “I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.” This was the very first promise of a Savior!<br><br>

            God was saying that one day, a special child would come from the family of Eve. That child would fight against the snake (Satan) and win. Satan would try to hurt Him, but this Savior would crush Satan completely.<br><br>

            <b>That Savior is Jesus.</b><br><br>

            Even though it took many years, Jesus came just like God promised. He lived a perfect life, loved everyone, healed the sick, and taught about God. Then He died on the cross for our sins. But He didn’t stay dead—He rose again! That was the moment He crushed the serpent’s head. Sin and death no longer had power over us.<br><br>

            Genesis 3:15 shows us that even when people make mistakes, God has a plan to bring them back to Him. It shows us that Jesus was part of God’s plan from the very beginning.<br><br>

            So whenever you feel scared, sad, or like the world is too dark, remember: God made a promise—and He kept it. Jesus, our Savior, is proof that God always keeps His word.
