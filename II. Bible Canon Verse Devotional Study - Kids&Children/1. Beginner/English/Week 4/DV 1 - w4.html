          <p class="chapterTitle" style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>Living for God (Christian Discipleship)</b></p>
          <p class="chapterTitle" style="color: #008000;"><b>Talking to God: What Jesus Taught Us About Prayer</b></p>

          <p>
            Have you ever talked to your best friend about your day, your dreams, or even your worries? That’s kind of what prayer is like—except you’re talking to God, who loves you even more than anyone else ever could. <br><br>

            In Matthew 6:9-13, Jesus teaches us how to pray. This passage is known as The Lord’s Prayer, and it's a beautiful guide to help us know what to say when we talk to God. Let’s explore what it means!</p>

            <ol>
              <li><b> "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name"</b><br>
                Jesus starts by reminding us that God is our Father. That means He cares for us, listens to us, and wants a relationship with us. Saying “hallowed be your name” means we respect and honor God because He is holy and awesome.</li><br>

              <li><b>"Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven"</b><br>
                Here, we pray for God’s way to be done in our world. We ask Him to help people love, forgive, and do what is right—just like it's done in heaven. Even young people can make a big difference by living out God’s love.</li><br>

              <li><b>"Give us today our daily bread"</b><br>
                This reminds us that we can ask God for the things we need—like food, strength, and help in school or life. God cares about our needs, even the small ones!</li><br>

              <li><b>"Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors"</b><br>
                We all make mistakes, and this part shows us that we can ask God to forgive us. It also reminds us to forgive others, just like God forgives us. It’s not always easy, but it's a big part of living like Jesus.</li><br>

              <li><b>"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one"</b><br>
                Life has challenges and choices, and sometimes we are tempted to do the wrong thing. Jesus tells us it’s okay to ask God for help to stay strong and make good choices.</li><br>
            </ol>

            <p>
            <b>Why Prayer Matters for You</b><br><br>

            Prayer isn’t about using fancy words or being perfect. It’s about being real with God—talking to Him like you would talk to someone who loves you and wants the best for you.<br><br>

            Whether you're a child, a teen, or an adult, prayer is a powerful way to stay close to God. You can pray anywhere—at home, at school, even in your heart when you're scared or happy.<br><br>

            So don’t be afraid to talk to God. He’s always listening, and He always cares.
