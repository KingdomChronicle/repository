        <h2>John 1:1</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
          <sup>1</sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Guiding Light</b></p>

        <p> This profound opening verse from the Gospel of John reveals that Jesus—the Word—has always existed and is the ultimate source of truth, light, and life. For teens navigating challenges, doubts, and important decisions, this truth offers valuable wisdom for everyday living. <br><br>

        <b>1. Jesus Is the Foundation of Truth</b><br><br>
        
        John 1:1 affirms that Jesus (the Word) is eternal and divine. In a world filled with shifting opinions, trends, and pressures, His teachings remain unchanging. When you struggle to discern right from wrong, turn to God’s Word for guidance.<br><br>
        
        <b>2. God’s Word Illuminates Our Path</b><br><br>
        
        Later in John 1, Jesus is described as "the light of all mankind" (John 1:4). Just as light reveals what is hidden, God’s truth helps us see clearly—whether in relationships, decisions, or struggles. When life feels uncertain or dark, His Word brings clarity, hope, and direction.<br><br>
        
        <b>3. You Were Created for a Relationship With God</b><br><br>
        
        Since Jesus has always been with God, He understands the importance of connection. He desires a real, personal relationship with you. No matter how alone or misunderstood you feel, He is always near, ready to listen and guide you.<br><br>
        
        <b>Practical Applications</b><br><br>
        
        <b>Hold on to truth:</b> When social media, friends, or emotions push you in different directions, align your choices with God’s Word.<br><br>
        
        <b>Be a light to others:</b> Just as Jesus brings light, your kindness, honesty, and faith can positively impact those around you.<br><br>
        
        <b>Stay connected to God:</b> Prayer and Scripture are not just for Sundays—they are essential for daily life. Start small (a verse a day, short prayers) and watch your faith grow.<br><br>
        
        John 1:1 is more than just a historical statement—it’s an invitation. Jesus, the eternal Word, wants to be the foundation of your life’s story. Will you let Him lead?<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 119:105 ESV</b><br>
        Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.</i><br><br>
        
        <b>Reflection:</b><br><br>
        <i>
        1. What have you learned from your devotion today?<br><br>
        
        2. Based on what you have learned, what advice can you give to people your age who are not yet part of God's Kingdom?</i><br><br>
