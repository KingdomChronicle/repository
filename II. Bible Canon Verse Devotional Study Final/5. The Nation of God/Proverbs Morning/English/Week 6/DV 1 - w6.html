        <h2>Proverbs 6:9-15</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <i><sup>9</sup> How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?<sup>10</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,<sup>11</sup> and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.
            <sup>12</sup> A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,
            <sup>13</sup>  winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,
            <sup>14</sup> with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;
            </i><b><sup>15</sup> therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</b>
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:9-15 (7/7)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Consequence of Wickedness</b></p>

        <p> This verse is a warning against the fate of the wicked, emphasizing that their punishment will be swift, decisive, and irreversible. Solomon, the author of Proverbs, assures his readers that those who engage in deceit and wickedness cannot continue indefinitely without facing divine justice. While they may believe they can escape the consequences of their actions, God's judgment is inevitable and often comes without warning. <br><br>

        <b>The Inescapable Justice of God</b><br><br>
        
        Throughout the Bible, God makes it clear that He does not tolerate evil indefinitely. Proverbs 6:12–14 describes the characteristics of a wicked person: one who lies, sows discord, and plots evil. Such a person may seem to prosper for a time, but their downfall is assured. The phrase "broken beyond healing" signifies a judgment so severe that there is no recovery. This echoes the ultimate fate of those who reject God—not only will they face ruin in this life, but they will also suffer eternal separation from Him in the next.<br><br>
        
        <b><i>Revelation 22:14-15 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>14</sup> Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates. <sup>15</sup> Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.</i><br><br>
        
        <b>Biblical Examples of Sudden Judgment</b><br><br>
        
        Scripture provides many examples of God executing swift and decisive judgment against the wicked. One notable case is Alexander the coppersmith, whom Paul mentions:<br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 4:14 ESV</b><br>
        Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.</i><br><br>
        
        Paul trusted that God would administer justice to those who opposed the gospel.<br><br>
        
        Another example is found in the story of Korah’s rebellion (Numbers 16). Korah led a group of Israelites in defying Moses and Aaron, attempting to usurp their God-given leadership. However, God responded swiftly, causing the earth to open and swallow Korah and his followers. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Numbers 16:33 ESV</b><br>
        So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly. </i><br><br>
        
        The verse states that they "went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed over them." Their punishment was not only sudden but also final, reinforcing the truth of Proverbs 6:15.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Warning for Today</b><br><br>
        
        While Proverbs 6:15 speaks of divine judgment, its message remains relevant in modern times. Those who persist in deception, corruption, and harming others may believe they are beyond consequences, but their downfall can come suddenly. Sometimes, this judgment occurs through personal failure, exposure of their wrongdoing, or destruction caused by their own actions. In the ultimate sense, those who reject God’s grace will face eternal judgment.<br><br>
        
        The passage serves as both a warning and a call to righteousness. Instead of living in deception and malice, believers are urged to seek wisdom, integrity, and obedience to God. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 3:5-6 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>5</sup> Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; <sup>6</sup> In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.</i><br><br>
        
        As Proverbs 3:5–6 reminds us, those who trust in the Lord and follow His ways will find security, while those who defy Him will inevitably meet destruction.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Proverbs 6:15 is a stark reminder that no one can escape the consequences of sin. Those who choose wickedness and deceit will eventually face sudden and irreversible judgment, whether in this life or the next. The Bible consistently teaches that God is just and will repay people according to their deeds. Therefore, the wise course of action is to live in righteousness, turn away from sin, and seek the grace and mercy of God before it is too late.
