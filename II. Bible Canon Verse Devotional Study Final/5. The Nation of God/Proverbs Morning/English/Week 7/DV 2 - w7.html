        <h2>Proverbs 6:16-19</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>16</sup> There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: 
            <sup>17</sup>  haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 
            <sup>18</sup>  a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, 
            <sup>19</sup>  <u><b>a false witness who breathes out lies</b></u>, and one who sows discord among brothers. 
        </p>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:16-19 (7/8)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>A False Witness Who Breathes Out Lies: The Perils of Deception
        </b></p>

        <p> Bearing false witness is a serious offense because it distorts justice, ruins reputations, and causes immense suffering. This sin is condemned in the ninth commandment: <br><br>

        <i><b>Exodus 20:16 NKJV</b><br>
        You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</i><br><br>
        
        God values truth and integrity, and He calls His people to be truthful in all circumstances. A society built on deception is bound for corruption, but a community that upholds truth thrives in righteousness and justice.<br><br>
        
        <b>The False Witnesses Against Jesus</b><br><br>
        
        One of the most tragic examples of false witness in the Bible is during the trial of Jesus Christ. The religious leaders, desperate to convict Jesus and secure His execution, sought false witnesses to testify against Him.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Mark 14:55-56 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>55</sup> Now the chief priests and all the council sought testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but found none. <sup>56</sup> For many bore false witness against Him, but their testimonies did not agree.</i><br><br>
        
        These false witnesses twisted Jesus’ words and fabricated accusations, leading to His condemnation.<br><br>
        
        Their deceit led to the unjust crucifixion of the Son of God, proving how powerful and dangerous false testimony can be. However, Jesus' resurrection demonstrated that truth ultimately prevails over deception. Those who bear false witness may seem to succeed for a time, but their lies will not stand before God’s judgment.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Consequences of False Witness</b><br><br>
        
        The Bible warns repeatedly about the dangers of false testimony: </p><br>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Injustice and Suffering</b> – False witness leads to wrongful punishment and suffering for the innocent. <br><br>
        
            <i><b>Proverbs 19:5 ESV</b><br>
            A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who breathes out lies will not escape.</i></li><br>

            <li><b>Ruined Reputations</b> – Lies destroy lives, reputations, and trust. A single false accusation can permanently damage someone’s name.<br><br>
        
            <i><b>Proverbs 22:1 NIV</b><br>
            A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold.</i></li><br>

            <li><b>Divine Judgment</b> – God detests dishonesty, and those who practice deceit will face consequences. Revelation 21:8 lists liars among those who will be separated from God in eternal judgment.<br><br>
        
            <i><b>Revelation 21:8 ESV</b><br>
            But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and <i><b>all liars</b></i>, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.</i> </li>
        </ol><br>

        <p>
        <b>The Story of Naboth: The Power of False Testimony</b><br><br>
        
        A powerful example of the destruction caused by false witness is the story of Naboth and King Ahab in 1 Kings 21. Naboth owned a vineyard that King Ahab desired, but Naboth refused to sell it. Queen Jezebel, Ahab’s wife, devised a wicked plan to falsely accuse Naboth of blasphemy.<br><br>
        
        She instructed men to bear false witness against him, leading to his execution. As a result, Ahab took possession of Naboth’s vineyard. <br><br>
        
        However, God saw the injustice and sent the prophet Elijah to pronounce judgment on Ahab and Jezebel. Both eventually faced divine punishment for their crimes, proving that false witness never escapes God's justice.<br><br>
        
        <b>God’s Call to Truthfulness</b><br><br>
        
        Instead of deception, God calls His people to be truthful.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 12:22 ESV</b><br>
        Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are his delight.</i><br><br>
        
        Truthfulness fosters justice, trust, and integrity in relationships.<br><br>
        
        Jesus Himself declared, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 14:6 NKJV</b><br>
        Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. </i><br><br>
        
        Showing that those who follow Him must walk in truth. Even when truth is difficult, believers are called to uphold honesty in their words and actions.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Bearing false witness is a grave sin that leads to injustice, broken relationships, and divine judgment. The false testimony against Jesus and the wrongful execution of Naboth reveal the devastating effects of deception. <br><br>
        
        However, God calls His people to be truthful and just in all circumstances. In a world filled with lies, believers must stand as people of integrity, reflecting the truth and righteousness of God.
