        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:20-23 (1/4)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Honoring Parental Guidance</b></p>

        <p> This verse, written by King Solomon, underscores the importance of parental wisdom and the lifelong impact it has on a child’s character and decision-making. Parents play a crucial role in shaping their children’s values, and Solomon’s appeal emphasizes that obedience to parental instruction is not just about discipline but about securing a successful and moral life. <br><br>

        Throughout history, many individuals have experienced moments when they resisted or disregarded their parents' advice, only to realize later how valuable that guidance was. Adolescents often struggle with the idea of authority and independence, sometimes rejecting parental teachings in favor of personal experience. However, as they mature, they frequently acknowledge the wisdom embedded in their parents’ words. Solomon highlights this tendency, particularly in relation to moral purity and righteousness, preparing the way for his warning against adultery in Proverbs 6:24. This shows that parental teachings are meant to protect individuals from the destructive consequences of sin.<br><br>
        
        A powerful biblical example of parents who demonstrated faith in God while instructing their child is found in the story of Moses. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Hebrews 11:23 ESV</b><br>
        By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. </i><br><br>
        
        Hebrews 11:23 commends the faith of Moses' parents, who hid him from Pharaoh’s decree to kill Hebrew baby boys. They saw something special in their son and trusted that God had a divine purpose for him. In an incredible twist of events, Moses' mother was later hired by Pharaoh’s daughter to care for him. This allowed her to instill in him a strong foundation of faith and identity as a Hebrew, despite growing up in the Egyptian palace.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Exodus 2:1-5 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> Now a man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite woman. <sup>2</sup> The woman conceived and bore a son, and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months. <sup>3</sup> When she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank. <sup>4</sup> And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him. <sup>5</sup> Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it. <br><br>
        
        <b>Exodus 2:6-10 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>6</sup> When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.” <sup>7</sup> Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” <sup>8</sup> And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” So the girl went and called the child’s mother. <sup>9</sup> And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him. <sup>10</sup> When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, “Because,” she said, “I drew him out of the water.” </i><br><br>
        
        Moses’ upbringing had a profound impact on his life. Even though he was raised with wealth and power, he did not forget his Hebrew heritage or the lessons his mother had likely taught him. As an adult, he chose to reject the fleeting pleasures of sin and instead aligned himself with God’s people. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Hebrews 11:24-26 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>24</sup> By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, <sup>25</sup> choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. <sup>26</sup> He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward. </i><br><br>
        
        Hebrews 11:24–26 states that he “considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt.” This decision illustrates the long-term influence of parental instruction and the importance of honoring and internalizing godly wisdom.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 6:20 reminds us that a parent's guidance is a gift meant to protect and direct their children toward a righteous path. Just as Moses' parents played a role in shaping his faith and future, all parents have the responsibility to instruct their children in God’s ways. Likewise, children must recognize the wisdom in their parents’ teachings, understanding that true success comes from heeding righteous instruction. Solomon’s words remain timeless, reminding every generation that parental wisdom is not a burden but a blessing.
