        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:20-23 (4/4)</b></p> -->
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Danger of a Mind Untrained</b></p>

        <p> Through the eyes of Solomon, the wise king and father, we are brought into a moment of reflection. As he watches from his window, he notices something familiar—an inexperienced young man walking carelessly, lacking sound judgment. This simple yet profound observation opens a serious warning: the absence of discernment, especially in one’s youth, can lead to destructive decisions. <br><br>

        Solomon’s words are not meant to condemn youth, but to reveal a truth: without guidance and wisdom, the young are especially vulnerable. The picture of the “young man lacking sense” is not a personal attack—it’s a call to awaken the heart and mind before it’s too late. Youth is a season full of energy, emotion, and curiosity. But when those emotions are not guarded by truth, and that curiosity is not directed by wisdom, it becomes easy to fall into traps—especially moral and spiritual ones. <br><br>
        
        This is a pattern we still see today. Many young people, full of desire for independence and pleasure, often follow their hearts blindly. Just like the prodigal son in Luke 15:11–24, they leave behind the safety of wisdom to chase temporary satisfaction. But emotion without direction leads to ruin. The prodigal had to hit rock bottom before realizing the emptiness of his choices. Solomon, however, writes this chapter to prevent such tragedy before it unfolds.<br><br>
        
        Yet it’s also important to note that youth does not have to be defined by foolishness. The Bible celebrates young people who walk in wisdom—like Joseph, David, Daniel, and Timothy. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Timothy 4:12 ESV</b><br>
        Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. </i><br><br>
        
        Paul urged Timothy not to let anyone look down on him because of his youth, but instead to be an example in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity. This proves that young men and women can be wise when they humbly seek God’s guidance.<br><br>
        
        Proverbs 7:7, then, is both a warning and an invitation. It warns us of the real danger that comes from living without discernment. But it also invites the young—and all people, regardless of age—to pursue wisdom seriously. It reminds us that true maturity is not defined by age, but by a heart trained in God’s truth.<br><br>
        
        In a world that often celebrates impulsiveness and self-expression without accountability, Solomon’s words still ring clear: Don’t be the young man who walks without sense. Instead, walk with wisdom, pursue understanding, and let God’s Word shape your steps.
