        <h2>Proverbs 7:8</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>

            <sup>8</sup> He was crossing the street near the house of an immoral woman, strolling down the path by her house.

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:20-23 (4/4)</b></p> -->
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>A Path Toward Danger: When Curiosity Ignores Wisdom</b></p>

        <p> In Proverbs 7:8, Solomon paints a vivid picture of a young man who carelessly crosses a boundary that wisdom clearly warns against. He strolls down the street near the house of an immoral woman—not by accident, but by choice. This simple action reveals a dangerous mindset: one that flirts with temptation instead of fleeing from it. What may seem like a harmless walk is actually the first step toward destruction. <br><br>

        Solomon's wisdom is clear and direct: "Keep your way far from her" (Proverbs 5:8). Yet the young man chooses the opposite. He walks closer, not farther. He exposes himself to temptation rather than guarding his heart. This isn’t just a warning about sexual sin—it’s a broader warning about how sin often begins. Sin usually starts with small, seemingly innocent compromises—steps that look harmless at first but lead us closer to spiritual ruin.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>I Thessalonians 5:21-22 NKJV</b><br>
        <sup>21</sup> Test all things; hold fast what is good. <sup>22</sup> Abstain from every form of evil. </i><br><br>
        
        This means we don’t just avoid the act of sin; we avoid the environment, the opportunity, and even the appearance of it. Yet, in today’s world, many still entertain temptation, thinking they can control their desires or stop before it’s too late. This kind of thinking is deceptive and dangerous. The young man in Proverbs 7 didn’t fall because he was overpowered by the woman—he fell because he positioned himself too close to her door.<br><br>
        
        This story serves as a wake-up call for all of us. Wisdom doesn’t just help us know what’s right; it teaches us to avoid situations that can weaken our resolve. Whether it's the influence of people, media, or our own unchecked desires, we must recognize when we are "walking too close" to danger. We must learn to turn the other way while we still can.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 7:8 reminds us that the path to sin is rarely sudden. It begins with one step in the wrong direction—a decision to entertain what God has warned us to avoid. But for those who walk in wisdom and heed God’s counsel, there is safety, peace, and the power to say no even before the temptation fully arrives.<br><br>
        
        Choose the path of wisdom—not the street that leads to regret.
