        <h2>Proverbs 7:4</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>4</sup> Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call insight your intimate friend,
        </p>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:20-23 (4/4)</b></p> -->
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Wisdom as Family, Insight as a Friend</b></p>

        <p> This verse beautifully paints wisdom and insight as more than just virtues—they are to be treated like close companions, even family. Solomon, speaking as a father to his son, emphasizes not only the importance of pursuing wisdom but also the depth of relationship one should have with it. In a world filled with temptations and distractions, godly wisdom must not be distant; it must be close, trusted, and personal. <br><br>

        To call wisdom our “sister” is to treat it with familial love and closeness—a constant presence in our lives. To regard insight as an “intimate friend” is to rely on it with the same trust and openness we would give a confidant. Just as we turn to loved ones in moments of uncertainty, we should turn to wisdom and understanding for guidance. Solomon knew that godly wisdom is not just helpful; it is essential for navigating life’s challenges and making god-honoring choices.<br><br>
        
        Scripture repeatedly shows us how vital this wisdom is in the Christian life. James encourages us to seek wisdom from God especially during trials, knowing that our faith is being tested and refined. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>James 1:2-5 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>2</sup> Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, <sup>3</sup> for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. <sup>4</sup> And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. <sup>5</sup>  If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. </i><br><br>
        
        Those who endure with faith are promised the crown of life. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>James 1:12 ESV</b><br>
        Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love Him. </i><br><br>
        
        Similarly, Paul reminds believers that every struggle, every suffering, works together for the good of those who love God—and that good is to become more like Christ. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 8:28-29 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>28</sup> And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. <sup>29</sup> For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. </i><br><br>
        
        Paul also prays for believers to be filled with spiritual wisdom so they can live lives pleasing to the Lord, bearing fruit, and growing in their knowledge of God.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Colossians 1:9-10 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>9</sup> And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, <sup>10</sup> so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; </i><br><br>
        
        Proverbs 7:4 invites us into a life where wisdom is not just a concept to admire, but a relationship to cultivate. When we treat wisdom as family and insight as a close friend, we become more sensitive to God’s voice, more rooted in truth, and more equipped to reflect Christ in every area of our lives.
