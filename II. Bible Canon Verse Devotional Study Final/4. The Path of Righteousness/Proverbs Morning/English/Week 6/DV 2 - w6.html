        <h2>Proverbs 6:16-19</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>16</sup> There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: 
            <sup>17</sup>  haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 
            <sup>18</sup>  a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, 
            <sup>19</sup>  a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:16-19 (1/8)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Seven Things the Lord Hates</b></p>

        <p> The book of Proverbs provides wisdom for righteous living, offering practical guidance for those who seek to honor God. Proverbs 6:16-19 presents a list of seven things that the Lord detests—sins that not only damage individuals but also disrupt communities and society. These seven abominations serve as warnings against behaviors that lead to destruction. By examining them, we can better understand what God values and how we can live in a way that pleases Him. <br><br>

        <b>Haughty Eyes</b><br><br>
        
        The first sin mentioned is "haughty eyes," which represents arrogance and pride. Pride is dangerous because it blinds people to their own faults and creates division between individuals. Scripture repeatedly warns against pride, emphasizing that "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble". <br><br>

        <i><b>James 4:6 ESV</b><br>
        But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” </i><br><br>
        
        Humility, on the other hand, fosters love and unity, making it essential for righteous living.<br><br>
        
        <b>A Lying Tongue</b><br><br>
        
        Lying is another sin that God hates because it distorts reality and breaks trust. A "lying tongue" can deceive, manipulate, and harm others. Truth is a foundation of godly character, and Jesus Himself declared:<br><br>

        <i><b>John 14:6a ESV</b><br>
        Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.</i><br><br>

        When people embrace dishonesty, they create chaos and confusion, leading to broken relationships and injustice.<br><br>
        
        <b>Hands That Shed Innocent Blood</b><br><br>
        
        The shedding of innocent blood refers to unjust violence, including murder and oppression. God values human life, and taking innocent life is a direct violation of His commandment:<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Exodus 20:13 ESV</b><br>
        “You shall not murder.</i><br><br>

        Injustice and violence grieve God because they destroy His creation and pervert justice. The Bible calls believers to protect the innocent and seek peace rather than harm others.<br><br>
        
        <b>A Heart That Devises Wicked Plans</b><br><br>
        
        Sin does not always manifest in actions; it often begins in the heart. A person who "devises wicked plans" intentionally plots evil, whether through deceit, theft, or harm to others. Jesus taught that evil thoughts come from within and defile a person. <br><br>

        <i><b>Mark 7:21-23 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>21</sup> For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, <sup>22</sup> coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. <sup>23</sup> All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.” </i><br><br>

        God desires purity of heart, calling His people to meditate on what is good, noble, and praiseworthy.<br><br>

        <i><b>Philippians 4:8 ESV</b><br>
        Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. </i><br><br>
        
        <b>Feet That Make Haste to Run to Evil</b><br><br>
        
        This phrase describes those who eagerly pursue sin rather than resist it. Instead of being hesitant about wrongdoing, they rush toward evil without consideration. God desires that His followers flee from sin and pursue righteousness. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 1:1 ESV</b><br>
        Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;</i><br><br>

        Psalm 1:1 warns against walking in the path of sinners, urging believers to delight in God's law instead.<br><br>
        
        <b>A False Witness Who Breathes Out Lies</b><br><br>
        
        Bearing false witness is a serious offense because it can lead to injustice, ruin reputations, and cause immense suffering. This command echoes the ninth commandment:<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Exodus 20:16 ESV</b><br>
        “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</i><br><br>

        Honesty is central to a just society, and God calls His people to be truthful in all circumstances.<br><br>
        
        <b>One Who Sows Discord Among Brothers</b><br><br>
        
        The final sin mentioned is "one who sows discord among brothers," which refers to those who create division, strife, and conflict. Unity is important in the body of Christ, and God desires peace among His people. Paul urges believers to:<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Ephesians 4:3 NLT</b><br>
        Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace. </i><br><br>
        
        Gossip, slander, and envy are dangerous tools of the enemy, and those who spread discord undermine God’s work.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion: Living in a Way That Pleases God</b> <br><br>
        
        Proverbs 6:16-19 offers a powerful reminder of the behaviors that God detests. Each of these sins damages relationships, promotes injustice, and leads people away from God. In contrast, God calls His people to humility, truth, justice, righteousness, honesty, and unity. By striving to live according to His principles, believers can honor Him and build a life that reflects His goodness. Instead of embracing what God hates, we should pursue what He loves—living in truth, loving others, and seeking peace in all things.
