        <h2>Proverbs 6:16-19</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>16</sup> There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: 
            <sup>17</sup>  haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 
            <sup>18</sup>  <u><b>a heart that devises wicked plans</b></u>, feet that make haste to run to evil, 
            <sup>19</sup>  a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:16-19 (5/8)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>A Heart That Devises Wicked Plans: The Corruption of Intentions</b></p>

        <p> Sin does not always begin with actions; it often starts in the heart. Proverbs 6:18 describes "a heart that devises wicked plans" as something the Lord hates. This refers to individuals who intentionally plot evil, whether through deceit, manipulation, theft, or harm to others. The heart is the center of a person’s thoughts, desires, and intentions, and when it is corrupt, it leads to sinful actions. Jesus taught, <br><br>

        <i><b>Mark 7:21-23 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>21</sup> For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, <sup>22</sup> coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. <sup>23</sup> All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.” </i><br><br>
        
        Instead of allowing the heart to be filled with wickedness, God calls His people to purity and righteousness, urging them to meditate on what is good, noble, and praiseworthy. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Philippians 4:8 ESV</b><br>
        Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. </i><br><br>
        
        The Bible provides examples of individuals who allowed their hearts to become corrupt, leading to destruction, as well as those who chose righteousness, leading to blessings.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Wicked Plans of Haman: A Biblical Example</b><br><br>
        
        One of the most striking examples of a heart devising wicked plans is Haman, a high-ranking official in the Persian Empire during the time of Queen Esther. Haman was a man filled with pride and hatred, particularly toward Mordecai, a Jewish man who refused to bow before him. Enraged by Mordecai’s defiance, Haman did not just seek revenge against him but devised a wicked plan to annihilate all the Jews in the kingdom.<br><br>
        
        Haman manipulated King Ahasuerus by falsely portraying the Jews as a rebellious people and convincing the king to issue a decree for their destruction. <br><br> 
        
        <i><b>Esther 3:8-9 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>8</sup> Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king’s laws, so that it is not to the king’s profit to tolerate them. <sup>9</sup> If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king’s business, that they may put it into the king’s treasuries.” </i><br><br>
        
        His plan was not based on justice but on personal hatred and pride. However, his wicked scheme backfired. Through God’s providence, Queen Esther courageously exposed Haman’s plot to the king. In the end, Haman was executed on the very gallows he had prepared for Mordecai.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Esther 7:10 ESV</b><br>
        So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king abated.</i><br><br>
        
        Haman’s story serves as a powerful warning that those who devise wicked plans will ultimately fall into their own traps. As Proverbs 26:27 states, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 26:27 ESV</b><br>
        Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, and a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling.</i><br><br>
        
        <b>The Consequences of an Evil Heart</b><br><br>
        
        When a heart is filled with wickedness, it leads to disastrous consequences:<br>
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><i><b>Broken Relationships</b></i> – Deception, manipulation, and betrayal damage trust between people, leading to division.</li><br>
            <li><i><b>Personal Destruction</b></i> – Just as Haman’s evil plan led to his downfall, those who scheme against others often suffer the consequences of their own actions.</li><br>
            <li><i><b>Separation from God</b></i> – God searches the heart and judges according to its intentions. <br><br>
        
            <i><b>Jeremiah 17:10 ESV</b><br>
            “I the Lord search the heart and test the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds.”</i><br><br>
            
            Those who persist in evil distance themselves from Him.</li><br>
        </ol><br>
        
        <p>
        <b>God’s Call to a Pure Heart</b><br><br>
        
        Instead of allowing wickedness to take root, God calls His people to have pure hearts that seek righteousness. Psalm 51:10 says, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 51:10 ESV</b><br>
        Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</i><br><br>
        
        Jesus also emphasized that,<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 5:8 ESV</b><br>
        “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</i><br><br>
        
        One way to guard the heart is by meditating on what is good. Philippians 4:8 instructs believers to, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Philippians 4:8 ESV</b><br>
        Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. </i><br><br>
        
        Filling the mind and heart with God’s Word and surrounding oneself with godly influences help prevent wickedness from taking root.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        A heart that devises wicked plans is dangerous, leading to destruction for both the schemer and those around them. The story of Haman illustrates how pride and deceit lead to downfall, while God’s justice prevails. <br><br>
        
        Instead of plotting evil, believers are called to seek purity of heart, meditating on what is righteous and pleasing to God. By surrendering our hearts to Him, we can avoid the corruption of wicked intentions and live in alignment with His will.
