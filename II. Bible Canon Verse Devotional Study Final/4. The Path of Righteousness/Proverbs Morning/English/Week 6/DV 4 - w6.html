        <h2>Proverbs 6:16-19</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>16</sup> There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: 
            <sup>17</sup>  haughty eyes, <u><b>a lying tongue</b></u>, and hands that shed innocent blood, 
            <sup>18</sup>  a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, 
            <sup>19</sup>  a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:16-19 (3/9)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>A Lying Tongue: The Destruction of Truth</b></p>

        <p> Lying is a sin that has devastating consequences, both for individuals and society as a whole. Proverbs 6:17 lists "a lying tongue" as one of the things that the Lord hates. Lying distorts reality, breaks trust, and leads to chaos. In contrast, truth is the foundation of godly character. Jesus declared <br><br>

        <i><b>John 14:6a NLT</b><br>
        I am the way, the truth, and the life,</i><br><br>
        
        - emphasizing the importance of truth in a believer’s life. Throughout Scripture, we see examples of how dishonesty brings destruction, while truth brings freedom and righteousness.<br><br>
        
        <b>The First Lie: Satan’s Deception in the Garden of Eden</b><br><br>
        
        The first recorded lie in the Bible came from Satan in the Garden of Eden. In Genesis 3, the serpent approached Eve and questioned God’s command, saying:<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Genesis 3:1 ESV</b><br>
        Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?</i><br><br>
        
        This subtle twisting of God's words planted doubt in Eve’s mind. Satan then directly contradicted God’s warning by saying:<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Genesis 3:4 ESV</b><br>
        But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. </i><br><br>
        
        - deceiving Eve into believing that disobedience had no consequences.<br><br>
        
        Eve and Adam ate the forbidden fruit, and sin entered the world. Their relationship with God was broken, they were cast out of the Garden, and humanity was subjected to sin and death. This story demonstrates that lies lead to destruction—not just for the one who lies, but for others as well.<br><br> 
        
        <i><b>John 8:44 ESV</b><br>
        You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. </i><br><br>
        
        The devil, whom Jesus calls “the father of lies”, uses deception to separate people from God and His truth.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Consequences of Lying in Daily Life</b><br><br>
        
        Lies come in many forms—deception, exaggeration, false promises, and betrayal. While some lies may seem small, they have far-reaching effects. A dishonest business deal can ruin a company, a false accusation can destroy a reputation, and deceit in a relationship can lead to heartbreak and division.<br><br>
        
        For example, in friendships and families, lying breaks trust. A child who lies to their parents repeatedly will struggle to regain their trust. A husband or wife who is dishonest in a marriage will damage the foundation of love and respect. Lies create confusion, insecurity, and broken relationships.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Story of Ananias and Sapphira: The Cost of Deception</b><br><br>
        
        A striking example of the destruction caused by lying is found in Acts 5:1-11, in the story of Ananias and Sapphira. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Acts 5:1-6 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>1</sup> But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, <sup>2</sup> and with his wife’s knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles’ feet. <sup>3</sup> But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? <sup>4</sup> While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God.” <sup>5</sup> When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard of it. <sup>6</sup> The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him.<br><br>
        
        <b>Acts 5:7-11 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>7</sup> After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. <sup>8</sup> And Peter said to her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for so much.” And she said, “Yes, for so much.” <sup>9</sup> But Peter said to her, “How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.” <sup>10</sup> Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. <sup>11</sup> And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.</i> <br><br>
        
        During the early church, believers sold their possessions and gave the money to support others. Ananias and Sapphira sold a piece of land but secretly kept part of the money while pretending to give the full amount.<br><br>
        
        When Ananias presented the offering, Peter confronted him, saying:<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Acts 5:3 ESV</b><br>
        But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? </i><br><br>
        
        This story is a powerful warning that God takes lying seriously. Ananias and Sapphira’s dishonesty was not just about money—it was an attempt to deceive God and His people. Their lie brought immediate judgment, demonstrating that deception leads to death, both spiritually and sometimes even physically.<br><br>
        
        <b>God’s Call to Truthfulness</b><br><br>
        
        The Bible repeatedly calls believers to be people of truth. Colossians 3:9-10 says.</b><br><br>

        <i><b>Colossians 3:9-10 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>9</sup> Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices <sup>10</sup> and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.</i></b><br><br>
        
        Truthfulness reflects the nature of God, and when we walk in truth, we build trust, integrity, and righteousness.</b><br><br>
        
        <b>Jesus taught that truth brings freedom:</b> </b><br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 8:32 ESV</b><br>
        and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.</i></b><br><br>
        
        Living in truth allows us to experience peace, healthy relationships, and a strong connection with God. While lying may provide temporary gain, it ultimately leads to pain and loss.</b><br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        A lying tongue is destructive, both in the spiritual and physical realms. The Bible provides clear examples—Satan’s deception in the Garden of Eden and the tragic downfall of Ananias and Sapphira—showing how dishonesty separates people from God and brings ruin. In contrast, truth aligns us with God’s character and leads to freedom and righteousness. <br><br>
        
        As believers, we must reject deceit and embrace honesty in every aspect of life, knowing that God honors those who walk in truth.
