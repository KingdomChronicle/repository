        <h2>Proverbs 7:2</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>2</sup> Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:20-23 (4/4)</b></p> -->
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Importance of Keeping God’s Commands</b></p>

        <p> 
            This verse emphasizes the necessity of following God's instructions to experience a full and meaningful life. Solomon highlights both the protective and life-giving aspects of divine wisdom, urging his son to value these teachings above all else. <br><br>

            <b>Living by God’s Word</b><br><br>
            
            Jesus reinforced this principle when He declared, <br><br>
            
            <i><b>Matthew 4:4 ESV</b><br>
            But he answered, “It is written, “‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”</i><br><br>
            
            Just as physical nourishment sustains the body, spiritual nourishment sustains the soul. Solomon's wisdom suggests that obedience to God's commands leads to a fulfilling and meaningful life, just as making healthy choices contributes to a longer life.<br><br>
            
            <i><b>Deuteronomy 8:3 ESV</b><br>
            And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. </i><br><br>
            
            <b>Obedience and Eternal Life</b><br><br>
            
            While Proverbs 7:2 speaks of life in a general sense, Scripture also teaches that true, eternal life comes through faith in Jesus Christ. Salvation is granted to those who believe in Him as the Son of God and the only Savior. <br><br>
            
            <i><b>John 3:36 ESV</b><br>
            Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.<br><br>
            
            <b>Romans 10:9-10 ESV</b><br>
            <sup>9 </sup> because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <sup>10</sup> For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. </i><br><br>
            
            Moreover, believers are promised an abundant life—one filled with joy, purpose, and spiritual fulfillment.<br><br>
            
            <i><b>John 10:10 ESV</b><br>
            The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. </i><br><br>
            
            <b>Guarding God’s Teachings</b><br><br>
            
            Solomon instructs his son to guard God’s teachings as "the apple of [his] eye." The Hebrew word for "apple" here, i'son, refers to the pupil—the most sensitive and valuable part of the eye. Just as the body instinctively protects the eye from harm, believers should be diligent in protecting God's truth in their hearts and lives.<br><br>
            
            <i><b>Psalm 17:8 ESV</b><br>
            Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings,</i><br><br>
            
            <b>Protecting Ourselves from Evil</b><br><br>
            
            Keeping God's Word close to our hearts helps us resist sin and stay on the right path. Just as the body reacts quickly to protect the eyes from harm, we must react swiftly to guard ourselves against temptation by relying on God’s wisdom.<br><br>
            
            <i><b>Psalm 119:11 ESV</b><br>
            I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.</i><br><br>
            
            <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
            
            Proverbs 7:2 reminds us that obeying God’s commands leads to a life of wisdom, protection, and fulfillment. Jesus reaffirmed the necessity of living by God's Word, and Scripture consistently teaches that true life—both temporal and eternal—comes from following His teachings. <br><br>
            
            By treating God's instructions as the "apple of our eye," we safeguard our spiritual well-being and grow in faith. As we strive to obey and cherish His Word, we experience the abundant life that God intends for us.
