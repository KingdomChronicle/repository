        <h2>Proverbs 7:5</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>5</sup> Let them protect you from an affair with an immoral woman, from listening to the flattery of a promiscuous woman.
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:20-23 (4/4)</b></p> -->
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Wisdom as our Protection from Temptation</b></p>

        <p> This verse continues Solomon’s fatherly warning, urging his son to hold tightly to wisdom and insight—not merely as knowledge, but as a defense against temptation. Wisdom is not passive; it actively protects those who embrace it. Here, it guards the heart and mind against the seductive words and actions of immorality. <br><br>

        In the previous verse, Solomon encourages his son to treat wisdom as a sister and insight as an intimate friend. These are voices of love and truth that would naturally warn someone from making a devastating mistake. In contrast, verse 5 introduces another voice—the flattering words of an immoral woman, symbolizing sin and temptation. The comparison is clear: while wisdom nurtures and protects, sin entices and destroys.<br><br>
        
        Solomon is not just warning against sexual immorality—he is highlighting the nature of sin itself. Temptation often begins with flattering words and hidden traps. Those without wisdom are easily swayed by appearances and emotions. But wisdom provides discernment. It teaches us to recognize danger before we step into it. Insight helps us see beyond the surface and resist the momentary pleasure that leads to lasting regret.<br><br>
        
        Adultery, in particular, brings destruction not only to one’s physical body but to one’s soul and relationships. It tears down self-respect, damages reputations, and can lead to irreversible consequences. That’s why Solomon urges his son to guard his heart and mind with the truth. Letting lust lead the way is foolishness; letting God’s Word lead is wisdom.
        Psalm 119:9–11 reinforces this truth: <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 119:9-11 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>9</sup> How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word. <sup>10</sup>  With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments! <sup>11</sup> I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.</i><br><br>
        
        The Word of God is our safeguard. It reveals the emptiness of sin and equips us to stand strong when temptation comes.<br><br>
        
        In a world that constantly appeals to our desires, Proverbs 7:5 reminds us to cling to God’s wisdom. Like a faithful sister or a loyal friend, it speaks truth when the world speaks lies. When we treasure God’s Word and walk with wisdom, we not only avoid the traps of sin—we also live in freedom, purity, and peace.
