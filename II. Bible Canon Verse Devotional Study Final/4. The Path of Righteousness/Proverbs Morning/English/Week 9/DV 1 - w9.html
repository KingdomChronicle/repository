        <h2>Proverbs 7:3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NKJV (New King James Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>3</sup> Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart.

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:20-23 (4/4)</b></p> -->
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Engrave It on the Heart, Bind It on the Finger: A Reminder of Wisdom
        </b></p>

        <p> Proverbs 7:3 carries a heartfelt appeal from a father to his son, urging him to value and internalize wisdom. "Bind them on your fingers as a reminder. Write them on the tablet of your heart," Solomon says, calling his son not only to remember his teachings but to live by them. This verse reflects a powerful truth that is still relevant for believers today: God’s Word must not remain as distant knowledge—it must become part of who we are. <br><br>

        The imagery Solomon uses is simple yet profound. Tying wisdom to one's fingers serves as a visible, constant reminder—just like the old Western tradition of tying a string around a finger to remember something important. It’s a way of saying, “Don’t let this slip from your mind.” More importantly, writing it on the heart speaks to an even deeper truth: the Word of God should dwell in our innermost being. It is not enough to simply know it; we must treasure it, meditate on it, and allow it to shape our thoughts, decisions, and desires.<br><br>
        
        For believers, this verse is a call to immerse ourselves in Scripture. Daily meditation on God’s Word keeps it alive in our minds and hearts. When life presents challenges, temptations, or moments of confusion, the Word becomes our weapon and our guide. Jesus Himself modeled this when He faced the devil in the wilderness—He resisted temptation not with personal reasoning, but with the authority of Scripture, saying, “It is written…” .<br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 4:4 ESV</b><br>
        But he answered, “It is written, “‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”<br><br>
        
        <b>Matthew 4:7 ESV</b><br>
        Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’” <br><br>
        
        <b>Matthew 4:10 ESV</b><br>
        Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, “‘You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.’”</i><br><br>
        
        When God’s Word is written on our hearts, obedience flows naturally from love. As Jesus said, <br><br> 

        <i><b>John 14:15 ESV</b><br>
        If you love me, you will keep my commandments. </i><br><br>
        
        Love and obedience are not forced but are the fruit of a heart deeply rooted in the Word. Wisdom tied to our fingers and engraved on our hearts becomes the anchor of our lives, guiding us in truth and protecting us from the snares of sin.<br><br>

        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        In a world filled with distractions and deception, Proverbs 7:3 calls us to deliberately keep God's Word close—not merely as words in a book or app, but as truth inscribed on our hearts, shaping the very foundation of our lives.
