        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:20-23 (4/4)</b></p> -->
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Through the Window: Gaining Wisdom from What We See</b></p>

        <p> This simple yet vivid picture introduces a powerful lesson. Here, Solomon reminds his son that what he is teaching comes not only from divine revelation but also from real-life experience. He has watched the world, paid attention to human behavior, and learned valuable lessons that he now wants to pass on. <br><br>

        As king, Solomon wasn’t only a man of wisdom but also of observation. From his window, he looked out—not as a busybody, but as a father, teacher, and ruler who had the responsibility to judge wisely and lead justly. What he saw in everyday life confirmed the truths of God’s Word. His wisdom was not detached from reality; it was deeply connected to what he witnessed in the lives of others.<br><br>
        
        This teaches us that gaining godly wisdom is not limited to reading Scripture, though that is the foundation. We must also be attentive observers of life. God’s truth is confirmed in the consequences we see in the choices of people around us—both good and bad. However, Scripture reminds us to avoid becoming idle gossips. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>1 Timothy 5:13 ESV</b><br>
        Besides that, they learn to be idlers, going about from house to house, and not only idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not. </i><br><br>
        
        Instead, we observe not to criticize, but to understand, to learn, and to apply truth with discernment.<br><br>
        
        Jesus Himself echoed this in His prayer in John 17. He didn’t ask the Father to remove us from the world but to protect us from the evil one. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 17:15-19 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>15</sup> I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one. <sup>16</sup> They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. <sup>17</sup> Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. <sup>18</sup> As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. <sup>19</sup> And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.</i><br><br>
        
        We are in the world for a purpose: to shine God’s light and speak His truth. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Corinthians 5:20 ESV</b><br>
        Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. </i><br><br>
        
        Like ambassadors sent to a foreign land, we must understand the culture we’re in without conforming to it. We study it—not to imitate it—but to better minister to those trapped in its deception.<br><br>
        
        Solomon’s view from the window reminds us to be spiritually alert. What we see around us should stir our hearts—not to judge others, but to fear God, to choose wisdom, and to help rescue those in danger. It encourages us to combine Scripture with reflection, and wisdom with action.<br><br>
        
        In today’s noisy world, may we also take time to look "through the window" with discerning eyes—seeing life as it is, learning from others’ mistakes and victories, and letting the Spirit of God teach us through both His Word and the world around us.
