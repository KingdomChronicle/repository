        <h2>Proverbs 6:16-19</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>16</sup> There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: 
            <sup>17</sup>  haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 
            <sup>18</sup>  a heart that devises wicked plans, <u><b>feet that make haste to run to evil</b></u>, 
            <sup>19</sup>  a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:16-19 (6/8)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Feet That Make Haste to Run to Evil: The Choice of Sin</b></p>

        <p> This phrase describes those who eagerly pursue sin rather than resisting it. Instead of hesitating or considering the consequences, they rush toward wrongdoing, fully embracing it. This type of person does not just stumble into sin but actively seeks it out, showing a heart that delights in wickedness rather than righteousness. <br><br>

        God calls His people to flee from sin and pursue righteousness. Psalm 1:1 warns, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 1:1 ESV</b><br>
        Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;</i><br><br>
        
        Rather than running toward evil, believers are encouraged to delight in God's law and follow His ways. The Bible provides both warnings against running toward sin and examples of those who have done so, leading to their downfall.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Reckless Sin of the Prodigal Son</b><br><br>
        
        A well-known biblical example of someone who ran toward sin is the Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32. This young man had everything he needed in his father’s house but was eager to indulge in worldly pleasures. He demanded his inheritance while his father was still alive, essentially wishing for his father's death.<br><br>
                
        <i><b>Luke 15:13 ESV</b><br>
        Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living. </i><br><br>
        
        He eagerly pursued a life of sin, not considering the consequences. However, once his money ran out, he found himself starving and alone, reduced to feeding pigs—an unclean and humiliating job for a Jewish man.<br><br>
        
        It was only when he hit rock bottom that he realized the foolishness of his actions. He repented and returned to his father, who welcomed him with open arms. His story shows both the danger of running toward evil and the mercy of God for those who turn back to Him.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Consequences of Pursuing Evil</b><br><br>
        
        When a person eagerly runs toward sin, there are always consequences. The Bible repeatedly warns about the dangers of pursuing evil: </p><br>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Destruction and Judgment</b> – Those who embrace sin will eventually face ruin.<br><br>
        
          <i><b>Isaiah 59:7 NLT</b><br>
          Their feet run to do evil, and they rush to commit murder. They think only about sinning. Misery and destruction always follow them.</i></li><br>

          <li><b>Bondage to Sin</b> – The more a person indulges in sin, the harder it becomes to turn away from it. <br><br>
        
          <i><b>John 8:34 ESV</b><br>
          Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin. </i></li><br>

          <li><b>Separation from God</b> – Choosing sin over righteousness distances a person from God.<br><br>
        
          <i><b>Romans 6:23a NKJV</b><br>
          For the wages of sin is death,<br><br>

          <b>Revelation 21:8 NIV</b><br>
          But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters, and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.</i><br><br>

          The second death refers to eternal separation from God in the lake of fire, as described in the book of Revelation. It is the final judgment for those who reject God. </li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>
        <b>God’s Call to Flee from Sin</b><br><br>
        
        Rather than running toward evil, God calls His people to flee from it. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 2:22 NLT</b><br>
        Run from anything that stimulates youthful lusts. Instead, pursue righteous living, faithfulness, love, and peace. Enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with pure hearts.</i><br><br>
        
        Instead of chasing after sin, believers should pursue what is good and pleasing to God.<br><br>
        
        One of the greatest examples of fleeing from sin is Joseph in Genesis 39. When Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce Joseph, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Genesis 39:12 ESV</b><br>
        she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house. </i><br><br>
        
        He did not hesitate or consider her offer—he immediately ran from the temptation. His example teaches that the best response to sin is not negotiation or hesitation but immediate escape.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Feet that run toward evil represent a heart that delights in sin. The Prodigal Son learned the hard way that chasing sin leads to destruction, while Joseph demonstrated the wisdom of fleeing from temptation. <br><br>
        
        God calls His people to avoid the path of the wicked and instead walk in righteousness. By delighting in God’s law and choosing to pursue holiness, believers can resist the pull of sin and live in His blessings.
