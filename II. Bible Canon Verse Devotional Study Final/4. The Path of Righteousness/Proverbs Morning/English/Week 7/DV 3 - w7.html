        <h2>Proverbs 6:16-19</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>16</sup> There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: 
            <sup>17</sup>  haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 
            <sup>18</sup>  a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, 
            <sup>19</sup>  a false witness who breathes out lies, and <u><b>one who sows discord among brothers</b></u>.

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:16-19 (8/8)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>One Who Sows Discord Among Brothers: The Poison of Division</b></p>

        <p> This refers to individuals who intentionally create division, strife, and conflict among people, whether in families, friendships, or in the church. God values unity among His people, and division is a destructive force that undermines His work. Ephesians 4:3 urges believers to, <br><br>

        <i><b>Ephesians 4:3 NLT</b><br>
        Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace. </i><br><br>
        
        However, gossip, slander, and envy are powerful tools of the enemy that tear people apart, sowing bitterness instead of love.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Division Caused by Absalom</b><br><br>
        
        A striking example of someone who sowed discord is Absalom, the son of King David. His story, found in 2 Samuel 15, reveals how his deceitful actions divided the nation of Israel and led to tragic consequences.<br><br>
        
        Absalom harbored resentment toward his father, King David, and secretly sought to take the throne. Instead of addressing his concerns openly, he plotted against his own father. He stood by the city gate and manipulated the people by pretending to care about their problems,<br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Samuel 15:4 ESV</b><br>
        Then Absalom would say, “Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice.</i><br><br>
        
        Through flattery and deception, Absalom stole the hearts of the people, turning them against David. His scheme led to a civil war, as David was forced to flee Jerusalem. However, Absalom’s rebellion ultimately failed, and he was killed in battle. <br><br>
        
        His story is a tragic reminder that sowing discord leads to destruction, not only for the one spreading it but for everyone affected.<br><br>
        
        <b>The Dangers of Division</b><br><br>
        
        The Bible warns against those who create strife among believers: </p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>It Destroys Relationships</b> – Gossip, slander, and betrayal cause division among friends, families, communities and even in the church.<br><br>
        
            <i><b>Proverbs 16:28 ESV</b><br>
            A dishonest man spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends.</i></li><br>

            <li><b>It weakens God's work among the believers</b> – The division among believers hinders the spread of the gospel. 1 Corinthians 1:10 urges believers to be united, saying, <br><br>
        
            <i><b>1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT</b><br>
            I appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, to live in harmony with each other. Let there be no divisions in the church. Rather, be of one mind, united in thought and purpose.</i></li><br>

            <li><b>It Opposes God’s Will</b> – Jesus prayed for His followers to be one, <br><br>
        
            <i><b>John 17:21 NLT</b><br>
            I pray that they will all be one, just as you and I are one—as you are in me, Father, and I am in you. And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me.</i><br><br>
            
            - showing that unity is God’s desire. Discord goes against His plan and aligns with the enemy’s schemes.</li><br>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
        <b>God’s Call to Unity</b><br><br>
        
        Rather than spreading division, believers are called to pursue peace and unity. Romans 12:18 instructs, <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 12:18 ESV</b><br>
        If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. </i><br><br>
        
        Instead of fueling conflict, believers should seek reconciliation and build one another up in love.<br><br>
        
        Jesus Himself taught that peacemakers are blessed: <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 5:9 ESV</b><br>
        Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</i><br><br>
    
        A heart that seeks peace, rather than discord, reflects the character of Christ.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        In Proverbs 6:16-19, a distinct literary pattern emerges: "There are six things the Lord hates, yes, seven that are detestable to Him." This structure highlights that the final sin—sowing discord among brothers—is the most serious and destructive on the list. <br><br>
        
        Discord has the power to break the foundation of relationships, communities, and even nations. A clear example of this is Absalom’s rebellion, which demonstrates how division leads to devastation.<br><br>
        
        However, God calls His people to unity, peace, and love. In a world filled with conflict, believers must stand against division and be peacemakers, living out the unity that reflects God’s true desire.
