        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:20-23 (3/4)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Guidance of God's Wisdom</b></p>

        <p> This verse highlights the continuous guidance of God's wisdom in our lives. It teaches that following good counsel, especially the teachings from God's Word, provides direction, protection, and knowledge in our daily journey. <br><br>

        A proverb is a short saying that conveys a general truth. It does not guarantee an easy or prosperous life, as John 16:33 reminds us that we will face trials in this world. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>John 16:33 NIV</b><br>
        “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”</i><br><br>
        
        However, common wisdom tells us that good decisions often lead to better outcomes. In this context, Solomon emphasizes to his son the importance of holding on to wisdom, as it brings clarity in life, peace of mind, and constant reminders of the right path to take.<br><br>
        
        The purpose of these verses is to warn young people about the dangers of sin, particularly adultery. This kind of sin presents strong temptations and often leads to destruction. Therefore, Solomon teaches that obeying parental guidance and God's Word is a crucial step in maintaining purity of heart and mind.<br><br>
        
        God's Word provides the right direction when we keep it in our hearts and follow it. It helps us discern between right and wrong so that we choose righteousness and avoid sin. At the end of the day, we can sleep with a clear conscience, knowing that we have obeyed God's commands. Psalm 3:5–6 says, “I lie down and sleep; I wake again because the Lord sustains me. I will not fear though tens of thousands assail me on every side.”<br><br>
        
        Throughout our waking hours, we find joy in meditating on God's Word and hearing His voice through it. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalm 119:59-62 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>59</sup> When I think on my ways, I turn my feet to your testimonies; <sup>60</sup> I hasten and do not delay to keep your commandments. <sup>61</sup> Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me, I do not forget your law. <sup>62</sup> At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules.</i><br><br>
        
        Reflecting on God's Word strengthens our faith and keeps us on the right path.<br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Proverbs 6:22 reminds us that obeying God's Word provides guidance, security, and wisdom in our daily lives. True success is not measured by wealth or fame but by our faithfulness to God's will. When we hold on to His commands and keep them in our hearts, we can be confident that wherever we go, God will always be there to guide, protect, and teach us.
