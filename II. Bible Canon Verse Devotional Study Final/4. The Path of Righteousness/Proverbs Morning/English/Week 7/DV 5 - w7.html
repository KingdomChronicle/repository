        <h2>Proverbs 6:20-23</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>20</sup> My son, keep your father’s commandand do not forsake your mother’s teaching. 
            <sup>21</sup> <i><b>Bind them always on your heart; fasten them around your neck. </b></i>
            <sup>22</sup> When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you. 
            <sup>23</sup> For this command is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and correction and instructionare the way to life,

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Reflection Series of Proverbs 6:20-23 (2/4)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Holding on to Parental Wisdom</b></p>

        <p> In these verse, Solomon urges his son to hold tightly to his parents' instructions, emphasizing their importance in shaping his character and guiding him through life. Parental wisdom is not just meant to be casually acknowledged; rather, it should be deeply embedded in one’s heart, serving as a moral compass for making righteous choices. <br><br>

        This principle is further reflected in God’s command to Israel during the Feast of Unleavened Bread. During this feast, Jewish families reminded their children of how the Lord rescued them from Egypt. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Exodus 13:9 NIV</b><br>
        This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the Lord is to be on your lips. For the Lord brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand. </i><br><br>
        
        This verse highlights the importance of constantly remembering God's Word. Over time, some Jews took this command literally by writing Scriptures on small pieces of parchment, placing them in leather cases called phylacteries, and wearing them on their arms and foreheads during prayer.<br><br>
        
        However, the true lesson behind these practices is not about physically carrying God's Word but about internalizing it. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Deuteronomy 6:6-7 NIV</b><br>
        <sup>6</sup> These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. <sup>7</sup> Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. </i><br><br>
        
        This passage teaches that God's instructions should be a constant part of daily life, influencing every decision and action. Solomon’s advice to his son aligns with this principle—God’s teachings and parental guidance should not just be acknowledged but cherished and obeyed.<br><br>
        
        The Bible also warns about the consequences of ignoring wisdom. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Proverbs 1:8-9 NIV</b><br>
        <sup>8</sup> Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. <sup>9</sup> They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.</i><br><br>
        
        These words remind us that honoring parental wisdom leads to blessings, while disregarding it often results in unnecessary hardship. The story of the prodigal son in Luke 15:11–32 serves as a powerful example. The younger son disregarded his father’s guidance, squandered his inheritance, and suffered greatly before realizing his mistake. His eventual return to his father symbolizes repentance and the recognition of true wisdom.<br><br>
        
        Today, we honor this wisdom by treasuring God’s Word and living by it. Rather than merely reading or hearing biblical teachings, we are called to let them shape our actions, decisions, and values. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Psalms 119:11 NIV</b><br>
        I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.</i><br><br>
        
        This verse echoes the message of Proverbs 6:20–21, emphasizing the importance of storing God’s truth in our hearts so that it directs our lives.<br><br>
        
        By keeping these teachings close—binding them to our hearts and minds—we ensure that we walk in righteousness and avoid the dangers of sin. Solomon’s words remain relevant, reminding us that true wisdom is not just knowing what is right but faithfully living it out every day. Following godly wisdom, especially the instruction of faithful parents, leads to a life of purpose, blessing, and alignment with God's will.
