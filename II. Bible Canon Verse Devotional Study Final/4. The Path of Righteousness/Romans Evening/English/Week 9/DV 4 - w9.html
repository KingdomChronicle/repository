        <h2>Romans 2:21-25</h2>

        <p>
            <sup>21</sup> Well then, if you teach others, why don’t you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but do you steal? 
            <sup>22</sup> You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you commit adultery? You condemn idolatry, but do you use items stolen from pagan temples? <i><b>
            <sup>23</sup> You are so proud of knowing the law, but you dishonor God by breaking it.</b></i> 
            <sup>24</sup> No wonder the Scriptures say, “The Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you.”
            <sup>25</sup> The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God’s law. But if you don’t obey God’s law, you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile.

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Hipocracy of the Jews (3/5)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>Blaspheming God Through Hypocrisy: A Timely Reminder in an Age of Superficial Spirituality</b></p>

    <p> 
        In Romans 2:23, the Apostle Paul rebukes a dangerous form of spiritual pride. He confronts those who claim to know and follow God’s Law, yet their lives contradict its very commands. This is part of a broader discourse where Paul uses rhetorical questions to expose the arrogance of certain religious Jews who believed that possessing the Law and having knowledge of it made them righteous before God. But Paul makes it clear: knowing the Law is not the same as obeying it. <br><br>

        Paul's message was not only for the Jews of his time—it speaks to all people, especially those who rely on religion or good works to justify themselves before a holy God. Whether Jew or Gentile, Christian or not, the danger of spiritual pride and hypocrisy remains ever-present. It’s easy to take pride in our knowledge of Scripture, regular church attendance, or use of godly language. But if our actions are in direct conflict with God’s commands, we are dishonoring Him. True righteousness is not measured by what we know, but by how we live out what we know. <br><br>

        Paul also teaches that the Law of Moses is not a shield from judgment. God cannot and will not overlook sin, especially the sin of hypocrisy, even if a person appears religious or does good works from time to time. His holiness demands justice. <br><br>

        This is why the gospel of Jesus Christ is essential. Christ alone fulfilled the Law perfectly and became the perfect sacrifice for our sins. Through faith in Him—not our own efforts—we are made righteous before God. And by living in obedience to His will, we maintain the holiness that He has graciously given us. Yes, it is true: nothing can separate us from the love of God. As Paul writes in Romans 8:38–39, <br><br>

        <i><b>Romans 8:38-39 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>38</sup> For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, <sup>39</sup> nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</i><br><br>

        And yet, this promise comes with a choice. Just as Adam and Eve were given free will, so are we. We can choose to remain under God's grace—or walk away from His will. God's love never fails, but we can choose to reject it.<br><br>

        This is not merely a message for ancient Jews. It is a warning to all—Christian or not—who depend on religion, tradition, or good deeds to appear righteous before God. In our time, it’s easier than ever to seem holy: regular church attendance, sharing Bible verses on social media, or being active in ministry. But if our lives are not aligned with God’s will, we are living in a deceptive form of holiness.<br><br>

        True righteousness is not measured by the depth of our knowledge, but by the depth of our obedience. External spirituality means nothing before God if our hearts are filled with pride, lies, or denial of truth.<br><br>

        <b>Christ Is Our Righteousness</b><br><br>

        In the midst of our weakness and failures, Christ alone perfectly fulfilled the Law. Through His sacrifice on the cross, He opened the path to true righteousness—not through our efforts, but through faith in Him. But this faith must not remain a mere idea; it must be visible in how we live—in our daily decisions, how we treat others, and in our humility before God.<br><br>

        A true believer is not seen only on Sundays or in public declarations. They are revealed in the quiet of the heart: Are we repentant? Are we humble? Are we obedient even when no one is watching?<br><br>

        <b>A Challenge in Our Time</b><br><br>

        In this age of abundant religious information and platforms, pretending has become easier. But God is not deceived. He sees the contents of our hearts. That’s why the question must be asked:
        <br><br>
        
        Is my life pleasing to God, or is it just a show for people?<br><br>

        Knowledge is not enough. Speaking the right words is not enough. What God seeks is a life that has been transformed—a heart full of love, humility, and faith that acts.<br><br>

        <b>A Final Reminder</b><br><br>

        Romans 2:23 is a reminder that knowledge without obedience is a form of blasphemy against the holiness of God. Hypocrisy is a disease of the soul—often subtle, but destructive to our relationship with Him. That is why God invites us to a life of truth, sincerity, and surrender—not mere outward appearances, but hearts that are changed and committed to follow Him.<br><br>

        If we truly want to honor God, it will be seen not just in our words or outward acts, but in how we walk daily in His path—with reverence for Him, love for others, and a humble dependence on His grace.
