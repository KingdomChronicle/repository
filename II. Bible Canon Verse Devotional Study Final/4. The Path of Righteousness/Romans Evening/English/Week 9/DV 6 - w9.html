        <h2>Romans 2:21-25</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>21</sup> Well then, if you teach others, why don’t you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but do you steal? 
            <sup>22</sup> You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you commit adultery? You condemn idolatry, but do you use items stolen from pagan temples? 
            <sup>23</sup> You are so proud of knowing the law, but you dishonor God by breaking it. 
            <sup>24</sup> No wonder the Scriptures say, “The Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you.” <i><b>
            <sup>25</sup> The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God’s law. But if you don’t obey God’s law, you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile. </b></i>

        <p class="chapterTitle" style="color: #008000;"><b>God’s Law: A Privilege or a Responsibility?</b></p> -->

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Hipocracy of the Jews (5/5)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The True Value of Circumcision: Obedience to God Over Ritual</b></p>

    <p> 
        In Romans 2:25, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of genuine obedience to God over mere ceremonial observance: “The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God’s law. But if you don’t obey God’s law, you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile.” This challenges the belief that religious rituals alone can make someone righteous before God. Though Paul was speaking to the Jews, the principle applies to all believers: outward expressions of faith are meaningless without true obedience to God. <br><br>

        <b>The Illusion of Ritual Without Righteousness</b><br><br>

        Earlier in Romans, Paul had already made it clear that simply knowing God’s law does not exempt a person from His judgment. <br><br>

        <i><b>Romans 2:12-13 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>12</sup> For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. <sup>13</sup> For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. </i><br><br>

        The Jews took pride in possessing the Law and bearing the sign of circumcision, thinking these guaranteed their standing before God. However, Paul corrects this belief, declaring that circumcision—a sacred covenant sign since Abraham—loses its value when not accompanied by obedience. <br><br>

        <i><b>Genesis 17:9-10 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>9</sup> And God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations. <sup>10</sup> This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. </i><br><br>

        A circumcised Jew who disobeys God’s law is essentially the same as an uncircumcised Gentile. The outward mark is meaningless if the heart remains unchanged.<br><br>

        <b>The Danger of Empty Religion</b><br><br>

        Paul’s message was shocking to devout Jews who believed their identity as God’s chosen people secured their salvation. Many assumed circumcision alone was enough, regardless of how they lived. This reflects a common human tendency to substitute religious rituals for genuine devotion. Paul dismantles this mindset, showing that no ceremony can cleanse the heart or hide sin. True faith must lead to obedience; otherwise, rituals become hollow traditions.<br><br>

        <b>A Call to Authentic Faith</b><br><br>

        The message of Romans 2:25 is still relevant today. It warns us against hypocrisy—professing faith while living in disobedience. Just as the Jews then put their trust in symbols, many Christians today may fall into the same trap. Baptism, communion, weekly church attendance, involvement in ministry, or even proudly identifying as a Christian—all these mean nothing if they are not reflected in a life of obedience to God's commands. Salvation is not earned through ritual, but through a heart that is transformed and surrendered to Christ.<br><br>

        <i><b>Romans 6:17-18 ESV</b><br>
        <sup>17</sup> But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, <sup>18</sup> and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. </i><br><br>

        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>

        Paul’s teaching in Romans 2:25 is a powerful reminder that what truly matters to God is obedience from the heart—not outward expressions of religion. Circumcision holds value only when it reflects a life of genuine faithfulness to God; it is not a magical ticket to salvation. In the same way, each of us is called to examine ourselves: Is our faith authentic, or merely for show?<br><br>

        Religious rituals and practices only have meaning when they flow from a heart that is fully surrendered to God. But when they are used to cover up a heart that is not truly faithful, they become acts of disrespect—deceptive uses of God’s holy name.<br><br>
        
        True faith is not merely spoken with the lips; it is lived out daily—in private and in public, before God and before others.<br><br>

        <i><b>Matthew 7:21 ESV</b><br>
        “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. </i>
