        <p>
            <sup>21</sup> Well then, if you teach others, why don’t you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but do you steal? <i><b>
            <sup>22</sup> You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you commit adultery? You condemn idolatry, but do you use items stolen from pagan temples? </b></i>
            <sup>23</sup> You are so proud of knowing the law, but you dishonor God by breaking it. 
            <sup>24</sup> No wonder the Scriptures say, “The Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you.”
            <sup>25</sup> The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God’s law. But if you don’t obey God’s law, you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile.

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle" style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>The Jew is Condemmed by the Law (4/4)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle" style="color: #008000;"><b>God’s Law: A Privilege or a Responsibility?</b></p> -->

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Hipocracy of the Jews (2/5)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Danger of Hypocrisy in Religion</b></p>

    <p> 
        This verse is part of the Apostle Paul’s powerful argument against religious hypocrisy. Though he specifically addressed religious Jews who believed their possession of the Law of Moses made them righteous before God, his message transcends time—it is a warning to all who claim to follow God while living in contradiction to His truth. <br><br>

        Paul's central message is clear: knowing God’s law is not enough; we must live it. In Paul’s day, many Jews considered themselves morally superior because they had received God’s law directly through Moses. They were confident in their religious identity, yet they failed to practice what they preached. Paul confronts this inconsistency by asking piercing rhetorical questions, revealing a deep spiritual contradiction between what they taught and how they lived. <br><br>

        By asking, “Do you commit adultery?” and “Do you rob temples?”, Paul isn’t simply pointing out isolated sins—he’s exposing the heart of hypocrisy. Even though they condemned others for immoral behavior, they themselves were guilty of similar offenses. The reference to robbing temples, though unclear in specific context, implies that even while rejecting idolatry in word, some were still entangled in compromising or dishonest practices. The underlying point is simple: even those who appear religious can fall into deep moral failure. <br><br>

        Paul’s challenge speaks directly to us today. In a world where it is easy to wear a religious mask—attending church, using spiritual language, or claiming moral high ground—it is equally easy to hide sin and brokenness behind a public appearance of faith. Religious hypocrisy is one of the most dangerous spiritual conditions, not only because it invites God’s judgment, but because it deceives both the individual and others around them. <br><br>

        Hypocrisy weakens the power and credibility of the gospel message. When we proclaim righteousness with our lips but secretly live in disobedience and sin, we send a confusing and damaging message to those who observe our lives. The gospel is not just a message to be preached—it is a life to be lived. If our actions do not reflect the truth we claim to believe, we not only dishonor the name of Christ, but we also cause others to stumble, question, or even reject the faith altogether. <br><br>

        We, who are part of the Kingdom, whether we are leaders, teachers, or ordinary believers, we are all called to walk in integrity and humility before God and others. God sees beyond our religious performances; He examines the heart. Outward displays of piety—such as attending church, quoting Scripture, or serving in ministry—cannot hide a heart that is disobedient, proud, rebellious, or unrepentant. <br><br>

        True righteousness begins with brokenness before God, repentance from sin, and a daily pursuit of Christlikeness. If we are to be faithful witnesses of the gospel, our lives must reflect its transforming power—not just in public, but especially in private. Only then will our message carry the weight of authenticity and truth. <br><br>

        <b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>

        Hypocrisy in religion is not a light matter—it is a deep spiritual danger that corrupts the soul, dishonors God, and distorts the witness of the gospel. The Apostle Paul's warning resounds through every generation: it is not enough to know God's Word or claim religious identity; we must be transformed by it. <br><br>
        
        The true mark of righteousness is not outward appearance but inward surrender—a heart that humbly walks in obedience and repentance before God.<br><br>

        Let us examine our hearts and strip away any pretense that masks disobedience. In these last days, when the world needs the light of truth more than ever, may our lives reflect the purity, humility, and integrity of Christ. For the message of the Kingdom gains true power and unshakable credibility only when it is faithfully and wholeheartedly lived out by those who serve, preach, and bear witness to it.
