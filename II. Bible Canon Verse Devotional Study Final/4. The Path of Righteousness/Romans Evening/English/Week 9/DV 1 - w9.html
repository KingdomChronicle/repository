        <h2>Romans 2:17-20</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>

        <p>
            <sup>17</sup> But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God 
            <sup>18</sup> and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; 
            <sup>19</sup> and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, <i><b>
            <sup>20</sup> an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth— </b></i>
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <!-- <p class="chapterTitle" style="text-transform: uppercase;"><b>The Jew is Condemmed by the Law (4/4)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle" style="color: #008000;"><b>God’s Law: A Privilege or a Responsibility?</b></p> -->

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Jew is Condemmed by the Law (4/4)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>God’s Law: A Privilege or a Responsibility?</b></p>


        <p> 
          In Romans 2:20, the Apostle Paul highlights the unique position of the Jews in relation to God's law. He describes them as “instructors of the foolish and teachers of children” because they possess the law that contains the very essence of knowledge and truth. However, this verse is not a celebration of self-righteousness. It is part of a larger argument leading to a challenging question: If you possess the law and teach others, why don’t you fully obey it? <br><br>

          Throughout the chapter, Paul constructs a powerful "if-this, then-that" argument. He lists the remarkable blessings of being an Israelite—having the law, knowing God’s will, and being able to discern right from wrong. These are true privileges that set them apart from the Gentiles. But with these privileges comes greater responsibility: to obey and live out their faith sincerely. Paul isn’t praising his listeners; he’s preparing them for serious self-examination.<br><br>
          
          The image of being a “guide to the ignorant” and a “teacher of children” reflects a sense of spiritual superiority—as if they are wiser, more mature, and more enlightened than others. They were entrusted with God’s law, the very expression of His knowledge and truth. But Paul’s next challenge is this: Is merely possessing the law enough to be called righteous? He questions their genuine obedience and exposes the hypocrisy of teaching others while failing to live out the very truths they proclaim.<br><br>
          
          This passage serves as a mirror—not just for Paul’s original audience but for all who claim to have spiritual knowledge. It reminds us that knowing God’s truth comes with the responsibility to live it out. Wisdom is not given to inflate our pride, but to reflect God’s holy standard and to show us our deep need for His grace.<br><br>
          
          <b>Application for Our Time</b> <br><br>
          
          Paul’s message is even more relevant in our present time. Through the Kingdom of God Program, we continue to receive deeper insights into God’s truths—truths that were once hidden for ages but are now being revealed and explained. Mysteries are being unveiled, and the light of God’s will is becoming clearer to us.<br><br>
          
          However, as our knowledge of God’s purpose deepens, so does the call to a higher level of accountability. We are not taught merely to gain knowledge—but to live it out daily. Paul’s question still resounds powerfully today: If you know God’s will, are you living it?<br><br>
          
          Being active in church, leading Bible studies, or sharing spiritual content online is not enough. If our lives do not align with what we proclaim, we fall into the trap of hypocrisy. True faith is not measured by how much we know, but by how deeply we obey.<br><br>
          
          God’s law is not just a list of commands—it is an invitation to a transformed life, a life marked by holiness, justice, and love. Yet we know that in our own strength, we cannot fully follow God’s will. That is why He gave us His Son, Jesus, the fulfillment of the law, and the Holy Spirit, who empowers us to live according to His desires.<br><br>
          
          Now, as part of God’s Kingdom, we carry not only the privilege of knowledge but also the responsibility to be a light to the world. Through a life aligned with God’s will, the light of Christ shines through our actions. We are called not only to know the truth but to live it out with power and integrity, as true representatives of His Kingdom on earth.<br><br>
          
          <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>
          
          In the end, Romans 2:20 teaches us that the true value of knowing God’s will is not measured by how much we know, but by how faithfully we obey. The privilege of understanding God's will always comes with the responsibility of living by it. As Paul reminds us, teaching others means nothing if our own lives contradict our message.<br><br>
          
          Today, in the light of the Kingdom of God Program and our growing understanding of God’s purpose, the call is even clearer: knowledge must be lived out. We are not called to merely carry wisdom, but to become living testimonies of the truth we’ve received. And by the help of our Lord Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit, a life that truly honors God is possible—a life that becomes a beacon of truth in a world in desperate need of it.<br><br>
          
          May we be found not only with God’s word on our lips, but also His will alive in our daily walk. In doing so, we fulfill the very purpose of His law: to reveal His holiness, His righteousness, and His unfailing grace.
