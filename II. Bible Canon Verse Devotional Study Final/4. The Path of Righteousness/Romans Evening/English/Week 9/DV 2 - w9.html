        <h2>Romans 2:21-25</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p>
            <i><b><sup>21</sup> Well then, if you teach others, why don’t you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but do you steal? </b></i>
            <sup>22</sup> You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you commit adultery? You condemn idolatry, but do you use items stolen from pagan temples? 
            <sup>23</sup> You are so proud of knowing the law, but you dishonor God by breaking it. 
            <sup>24</sup> No wonder the Scriptures say, “The Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you.”
            <sup>25</sup> The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God’s law. But if you don’t obey God’s law, you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile.

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Hipocracy of the Jews (1/5)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>A Call to Authentic Faith: Living the Truth We are Sharing</b></p>

    <p> 
        This verse challenges the hypocrisy of those who take pride in knowing and teaching God's law but fail to live by it. Paul's message is not limited to the Jews of his time—it is a timeless call to everyone who assumes that outward religiosity or knowledge of Scripture makes them right before God. <br><br>

        Paul directs his words toward those who were confident in their religious identity, believing that because they possessed the Law of Moses, they were shielded from God's judgment. But Paul breaks down this false assurance by asking hard, rhetorical questions. He exposes the dangerous gap between knowing what is right and actually living it out. His aim is not to shame, but to awaken hearts to the truth that authenticity matters to God. This teaching is echoed in James, which urges believers: <br><br>
        
        <i><b>James 1:22 NLT</b><br>
        But don’t just listen to God’s word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves. </i><br><br>
        
        Scripture consistently emphasizes that listening or teaching God’s Word is not enough—we must obey it. When our lives contradict our words, we damage our testimony and misrepresent the God we claim to serve. Paul deepens this truth: <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Romans 3:10 NLT</b><br>
        As the Scriptures say, “No one is righteous— not even one.</i><br><br>
        
        This powerful declaration strips away every illusion of self-righteousness. It is a sobering and humbling reminder that no human effort, position, or knowledge can make us right before God. Even those who teach, lead, or serve in ministry are not exempt—we are all equally in need of God’s mercy and grace.<br><br>
        
        We all fall short of God's perfect standard, and this exposes our desperate need for salvation that only Christ can offer. <br><br>
        
        <i><b>Matthew 5:17 ESV</b><br>
        Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. </i><br><br>
        
        Jesus is the fulfillment of the Law. He perfectly satisfied its every demand—both in obedience and in bearing its penalty through His death and resurrection. What we could never accomplish through our own efforts, He completed on our behalf. His life, death, and victory over sin fulfilled the Law’s righteous requirements once and for all. And now, it is only through faith in Him—not through religious rituals or human striving, but through a personal and transforming relationship—that we are forgiven, made new, and declared righteous before God. <br><br>
        
        Through Christ, we not only receive grace, but we are also empowered. By His Spirit, we gain the strength to walk in obedience, the boldness to live out God’s will, and the confidence to face life not in our own goodness, but in His. He doesn’t just cleanse us—He enables us to live a life that honors Him.<br><br>
        
        Romans 2:21 serves as a mirror. It shows us that spiritual leadership without personal obedience is empty. But it also offers hope: the invitation to turn away from hypocrisy and to pursue a sincere walk with God, marked by humility, repentance, and real change.<br><br>
        
        <b>Application Today: Living Out Authentic Faith</b><br><br>
        
        In today’s world, where social media allows people to present polished images of themselves, the danger of spiritual hypocrisy is more present than ever. It’s easy to quote Scripture, share devotionals, or lead church ministries—and yet secretly harbor sins we condemn in others. Paul’s message in Romans 2:21 calls us to examine our hearts and align our private lives with the truth we proclaim publicly.<br><br>
        
        Authentic faith begins with self-reflection. Before we correct others, we must allow God's Word to correct us. Are we honest in our work and relationships? Do we walk in humility, or are we driven by pride? Are we showing grace to others as we have received grace?<br><br>
        
        This verse challenges leaders, teachers, and every believer to live what they teach. It also encourages us to depend on God’s grace daily. We are not perfect, but we are called to be consistent—living with integrity, walking in obedience, and pointing others not to our own righteousness, but to Christ.<br><br>
        
        <i><b>2 Timothy 3:5 NLT</b><br>
        They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that!</i><br><br>
        
        Let us not settle for a form of godliness that denies its power. Let us seek an authentic, Spirit-filled life that reflects the heart of God—one that teaches not only with words, but by example.<br><br>
        
        <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
        
        Romans 2:21 is more than a rebuke—it is a call to authentic faith. It reminds us that knowing God's law is not enough; we must live it. The verses in James 1:22 and Romans 3:10 reinforce that true righteousness is not found in religious activity, but in humble obedience and dependence on God’s grace. In a world filled with empty words, may our lives be a testimony of truth, integrity, and genuine transformation.
