        <h2>Romans 2:17-20</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>17</sup> But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God <i><b>
            <sup>18</sup> and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; </b></i>
            <sup>19</sup> and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 
            <sup>20</sup> an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Jew is Condemmed by the Law (2/4)</b></p>
        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Knowledge of God's Will</b></p>

        <p> 
            This verse is part of Paul's ongoing argument in his letter to the Romans, where he outlines the privileges of the Jews concerning the law. However, he later uses this to highlight their misplaced confidence in the law as the basis of righteousness. <br><br>

            <b>The Jews' Knowledge of God's Will</b><br><br>
            
            In this verse, Paul refers to those who not only rely on the Law of Moses but also genuinely understand God's will through it. Because of their education in the law, they have the ability to discern what is good, right, and pleasing in God's sight. This is a significant privilege granted exclusively to Israel and not to other nations. Moses affirms Israel's unique position, <br><br>
            
            <i><b>Deuteronomy 4:8 ESV</b><br>
            And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?</i><br><br>
            
            This reinforces the idea that the Jews had a special knowledge of God's will because they had been thoroughly taught through His law.<br><br>
            
            <b>Misplaced Confidence in the Law</b><br><br>
            
            While having knowledge of the law is a blessing, Paul highlights a critical mistake made by many Jews—their misplaced confidence in the law as the sole foundation of their righteousness. They believed that because they knew God's will and evaluated things based on the law, they would not be judged for their sins.<br><br>
            
            However, Paul will show in the following verses that mere knowledge is not enough. Even though they have the ability to recognize what is good and righteous, this does not mean they themselves live according to it. In fact, they often break the very law they take pride in. Paul teaches that being Jewish and having knowledge of the law does not remove the need for God's grace. Like the Gentiles, they also need to be saved through faith in Jesus Christ, not merely by following the law.<br><br>
            
            <b>Application for Today</b><br><br>
            
            Romans 2:18 serves as a reminder to all believers that knowledge of God's Word is a great blessing, but it comes with responsibility. It is not enough to simply know God's will; it must be lived out. Many people mistakenly believe that being religious or familiar with the Bible is enough to justify them. However, Paul teaches that true righteousness comes from God's grace through faith in Christ.<br><br>
            
            <b>Living Out the Knowledge of God's Will</b><br><br>
            
            For religious groups today, this verse emphasizes the importance of applying biblical knowledge in daily life. Churches, ministries, and individuals must be careful not to equate mere understanding of Scripture with genuine faith. True discipleship requires both knowledge and obedience. Jesus Himself warns against hypocrisy, urging His followers not just to hear the Word but to act on it.<br><br>
            
            <i><b>James 1:22 NIV</b><br>
            Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. </i><br><br>
            
            Furthermore, Christian communities should strive to be a light to the world, not only in teaching but also in action. Just as Israel was given the law to reveal God's righteousness, believers today have the responsibility to reflect Christ's love, truth, and justice in their lives.<br><br>
            
            <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
            
            Ultimately, the message of Romans 2:18 remains relevant today. Whether Jew or Gentile, mere knowledge of God is not enough; it must be accompanied by obedience and genuine faith. Our confidence should rest not in our knowledge or works, but in the infinite grace of God revealed through Jesus Christ. By living out what we learn from Scripture, we fulfill God's will and demonstrate His transformative power to the world.
