        <h2>Romans 2:13</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>13</sup>For merely listening to the law doesn’t make us right with God. It is obeying the law that makes us right in his sight.
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>True Righteousness Is Not Just in Hearing</b></p>

        <p> 
            In Romans 2:13, Paul emphasizes that merely listening to the law is not enough to be considered righteous before God. Instead, true righteousness is measured by obedience to the law. <br><br>

            During that time, many Jews mistakenly believed that simply being part of Israel was enough to guarantee their salvation. Since they were under the Law of Moses and had grown up hearing it read aloud, they assumed this granted them a special status before God. They knew the commandments, understood the principles, and identified as God's chosen people. However, Paul makes it clear that merely hearing the law does not make anyone righteous.<br><br>

            Paul points out that in order to be considered righteous, one must obey the law. However, elsewhere in his letter, he explains that to be truly justified under the law, one would have to follow it perfectly—something no one can achieve. In reality, only Jesus was able to fully obey God's law.<br><br>

            <b>The Law’s Limitation and the Need for a Savior</b><br><br>

            This message aligns with the teachings of the book of Hebrews, which explains that the old covenant, including the Law of Moses, was never meant to save humanity from sin. Rather, it was designed to reveal human sinfulness and prepare people to accept the Savior. <br><br>

            <i><b>Hebrews 10:1-5 ESV</b><br>
            <sup>1</sup> For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. <sup>2</sup> Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? <sup>3</sup> But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. <sup>4</sup> For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. <sup>5</sup> Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, “Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for me;<br><br>

            <b>Hebrews 10:6-10 ESV</b><br>
            <sup>6</sup> in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure. <sup>7</sup> Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’” <sup>8</sup> When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), <sup>9</sup> then he added, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. <sup>10</sup> And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</i><br><br>

            The law serves as a teacher, demonstrating God's holiness and humanity’s inability to fulfill it completely. Because of this, the law points to the need for Christ.<br><br>

            In summary, Romans 2:13 serves as an important reminder that true righteousness does not come merely from knowing the law but from obeying it. Yet, since no one can follow it perfectly, Paul introduces the ultimate solution—faith in Jesus Christ. Through Him, we attain the righteousness we could never achieve on our own.<br><br>

            <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>

            Being religious or having knowledge of God's law is not enough to make us righteous before Him. True righteousness comes from obedience. However, since no one can obey perfectly, this verse highlights our need for Jesus. Through His sacrifice, He fulfilled the law for us and provided a way for us to be forgiven and made righteous through faith in Him. This truth challenges us not only to listen to God's Word but also to live it out, trusting in Christ’s grace for our salvation.
