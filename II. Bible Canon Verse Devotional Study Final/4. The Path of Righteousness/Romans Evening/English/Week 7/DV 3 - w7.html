        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Reward for Doing Good</b></p>

        <p> 
            This verse highlights the impartiality of God's judgment. While Romans 2:9 warns of judgment for those who do evil, verse 10 offers a promise of reward for those who do good. However, Paul later clarifies that no one can achieve perfect goodness on their own. This essay will explore the promise of reward for good works, the universal standard of God's justice, and the necessity of faith in Christ, supported by relevant Bible verses. <br><br>

            <b>The Promise of Glory, Honor, and Peace</b><br><br>

            Paul states that those who do good will receive glory, honor, and peace. This means that God recognizes and rewards righteousness. This aligns with Jesus' teaching:<br><br>

            <i><b>Matthew 5:16 ESV</b><br>
            In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. </i><br><br>

            Good works reflect God's character and bring Him glory. While believers should strive for righteousness, it is important to understand that true goodness comes from God alone. Psalm 84:11 also affirms God’s reward for righteousness:<br><br>

            <i><b>Psalm 84:11 ESV</b><br>
            For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly.</i><br><br>

            This shows that God bestows blessings on those who live righteously. However, the Bible also teaches that no one can achieve this standard on their own.<br><br>

            <b>The Universal Standard of God's Justice</b><br><br>

            Romans 2:10 emphasizes that God's rewards and judgments apply to both Jews and Gentiles alike. This principle is reaffirmed in Acts:<br><br>

            <i><b>Acts 10:34-35 NKJV</b><br>
            <sup>34</sup> Then Peter opened his mouth and said: “In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality. <sup>35</sup> But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him. </i><br><br>

            God does not show favoritism based on nationality, heritage, or status. Instead, He judges and rewards each person according to their actions. Paul reinforces this,<br><br>

            <i><b>Romans 2:6 NKJV</b><br>
            who “will render to each one according to his deeds</i><br><br>

            This underscores that everyone is accountable before God. However, Paul later explains that no one naturally meets God's standard of righteousness.<br><br>

            <b>The Reality That No One is Truly Good</b><br><br>

            Although Romans 2:10 speaks of rewards for doing good, Paul later clarifies that no human can achieve true goodness on their own. <br><br>

            <i><b>Romans 3:12 ESV</b><br>
            All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.</i><br><br>

            Even our best efforts fall short of God's perfect holiness. <br><br>

            <i><b>Isaiah 64:6 NKJV</b><br>
            But we are all like an unclean thing, And all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags; We all fade as a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, Have taken us away.</i><br><br>

            Since no one can truly do good by God's standard, salvation cannot be earned through works alone.<br><br>

            <b>The Necessity of Faith in Christ</b><br><br>

            Since no one can be perfectly righteous, our only hope is faith in Jesus Christ. Paul’s entire message in Romans leads to this conclusion. <br><br>

            <i><b>Romans 3:22 KJV</b><br>
            even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference</i><br><br>

            We receive righteousness not by our own works, but through faith in Christ. While good works are important, they are the result of salvation, not the cause of it. True glory, honor, and peace come only through a relationship with Christ.<br><br>

            <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>

            Romans 2:10 highlights God's promise to reward those who do good, but it also sets up the greater truth that no one can achieve true goodness apart from God. God's justice is impartial—He judges everyone fairly, regardless of background. However, since all have sinned, our only hope of receiving glory, honor, and peace is through faith in Jesus Christ. Paul’s message ultimately leads to the gospel: salvation is not earned by works, but freely given through Christ. The choice remains for each person—will we rely on our own imperfect goodness, or will we place our faith in the only One who is truly righteous?
