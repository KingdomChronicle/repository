        <h2>Romans 2:10</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">KJV (King James Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>10</sup>But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Reward for Doing Good</b></p>

        <p> 
            This verse highlights the impartiality of God's judgment. While Romans 2:9 warns of judgment for those who do evil, verse 10 offers a promise of reward for those who do good. This study will explore the promise of reward for good works, and the universal standard of God's justice<br><br>

            <b>The Promise of Glory, Honor, and Peace</b><br><br>

            Paul states that those who do good will receive glory, honor, and peace. This means that God recognizes and rewards righteousness. This aligns with Jesus' teaching:<br><br>

            <i><b>Matthew 5:16 ESV</b><br>
            In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. </i><br><br>

            Good works reflect God's character and bring Him glory. While believers should strive for righteousness, it is important to understand that true goodness comes from God alone. Psalm 84:11 also affirms God’s reward for righteousness:<br><br>

            <i><b>Psalm 84:11 ESV</b><br>
            For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly.</i><br><br>

            This shows that God bestows blessings on those who live righteously. However, the Bible also teaches that no one can achieve this standard on their own.<br><br>

            <b>The Universal Standard of God's Justice</b><br><br>

            Romans 2:10 emphasizes that God's rewards and judgments apply to both Jews and Gentiles alike. This principle is reaffirmed in Acts:<br><br>

            <i><b>Acts 10:34-35 NKJV</b><br>
            <sup>34</sup> Then Peter opened his mouth and said: “In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality. <sup>35</sup> But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him. </i><br><br>

            God does not show favoritism based on nationality, heritage, or status. Instead, He judges and rewards each person according to their actions. Paul reinforces this,<br><br>

            <i><b>Romans 2:6 NKJV</b><br>
            who “will render to each one according to his deeds</i><br><br>

            This underscores that everyone is accountable before God. <br><br>

            <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>

            Romans 2:10 highlights God's promise of reward for those who do good, offering glory, honor, and peace. This verse emphasizes that God, as a just judge, recognizes and blesses righteousness. Throughout Scripture, righteousness is portrayed as a reflection of God's character. When believers walk in obedience and seek to do good, they become a testimony of His goodness, drawing others to Him. Additionally, God does not withhold good things from those who walk uprightly, reinforcing the idea that God delights in blessing those who strive to live according to His ways.
