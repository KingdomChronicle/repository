        <h2>Romans 2:8</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>8</sup>But he will pour out his anger and wrath on those who live for themselves, who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness.

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Dire Consequence of Living for Oneself and Neglecting Spiritual Needs</b></p>

        <p> 
          This verse serves as a clear warning to those who prioritize their selfish desires, refuse to submit to God, and persist in sin. While God is loving and merciful, He is also just and will not overlook the continuous disobedience of people. <br><br>

          <b>The Destructive Outcome of a Selfish Life</b><br><br>
          
          Many people live solely for their personal interests—seeking wealth, fame, and power without regard for God and His will. This kind of life may be filled with worldly pleasures but lacks true meaning. Jesus reminds us,<br><br>
          
          <i><b>Matthew 16:26 ESV</b><br>
          For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul? </i><br><br>
          
          This verse emphasizes that even if we attain everything the world offers, it is meaningless if we lose our souls in the process.<br><br>
          
          Instead of pursuing selfish desires, God calls us to trust and follow Him. <br><br>
          
          <i><b>Luke 9:23 ESV</b><br>
          And he said to all, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. </i><br><br>
          
          This means setting aside our personal ambitions and aligning our lives with God's will.<br><br>
          
          <b>Rejecting the Truth of God</b><br><br>
          
          Apart from selfishness, Romans 2:8 also highlights those who "refuse to obey the truth." God's truth is clearly revealed in His Word, yet many choose to reject it because they prefer to follow their own ways.<br><br>
          
          <i><b>2 Thessalonians 1:8-9 NLT</b><br>
          <sup>8</sup> in flaming fire, bringing judgment on those who don’t know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus. <sup>9</sup> They will be punished with eternal destruction, forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power. </i><br><br>
          
          This shows that disobedience to God has severe consequences—eternal separation from Him.<br><br>
          
          <i><b>Galatians 6:7-8 NLT</b><br>
          <sup>7</sup> Don’t be misled—you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant. <sup>8</sup> Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit. </i><br><br>
          
          Those who continue in sin will reap destruction, while those who follow God will receive eternal life.<br><br>
          
          <b>The Punishment for Those Who Live in Wickedness</b><br><br>
          
          Not only do these individuals reject God, but they also actively live in sin. The Bible repeatedly warns that sin leads to judgment. <br><br>
          
          <i><b>Matthew 25:41 ESV</b><br>
          Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels'. </i><br><br>
          
          Those who persist in wickedness will face the same fate as Satan and his fallen angels.<br><br>
          
          <i><b>Revelation 21:8 ESV</b><br>
          But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.</i><br><br>
          
          Those who reject God and live in sin will suffer eternal punishment.<br><br>
          
          <b>God’s Call to Repentance and Faith</b><br><br>
          
          Despite the warning in Romans 2:8, God does not take pleasure in the destruction of people. Instead, He desires everyone to repent and turn to Him. <br><br>
          
          <i><b>2 Peter 3:9 ESV</b><br>
          The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. </i><br><br>
          
          The good news is that there is hope for those who are willing to come to Jesus. <br><br>
          
          <i><b>John 3:16 ESV</b><br>
          For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. </i><br><br>
          
          Rather than living for oneself, God calls us to follow Him and accept His salvation. <br><br>
          
          <i><b>Romans 10:10 NKJV</b><br>
          For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. </i><br><br>
          
          <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
          
          Romans 2:8 is a strong warning to those who live only for themselves and disregard their spiritual needs. It reminds us that sin carries consequences, and those who reject God and His truth will face His righteous wrath.<br><br>
          
          However, God is merciful and continuously calls people to repentance and faith in Jesus. Instead of continuing in selfish and sinful living, we must turn to God, follow His will, and trust in His promise of eternal life.
