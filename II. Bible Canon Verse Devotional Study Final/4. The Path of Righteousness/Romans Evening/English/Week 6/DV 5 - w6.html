        <h2>Romans 2:6</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>6</sup>God "will repay each person according to what they have done."
        </p>

        <br><hr>
        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>God Will Repay Each Person According to Their Deeds</b></p>

        <p> 
            In this verse, Paul declares a foundational truth about God’s justice: every person will be judged based on their deeds. He is quoting from: <br><br>

            <i><b>Psalms 62:12 NLT</b><br>
            unfailing love, O Lord, is yours. Surely you repay all people according to what they have done.<br><br>

            <b>Proverbs 24:12 ESV</b><br>
            If you say, “Behold, we did not know this,” does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it, and will he not repay man according to his work?</i><br><br>

            - reinforcing the biblical principle that God’s judgment is impartial. However, while this verse might seem to suggest that salvation is based on good works, Paul later clarifies that no one can be saved by their own righteousness (Romans 3:23). Instead, our deeds reveal the condition of our hearts and whether we have truly placed our faith in God.<br><br>

            <b>The Righteous Judgment of God</b><br><br>

            Paul has been addressing those who judge others while failing to recognize their own sinfulness. <br><br>

            <i><b>Romans 2:1-3 ESV</b><br>
            <sup>1</sup> Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. <sup>2</sup> We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things. <sup>3</sup> Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God? </i><br><br>

            Many religious people believed that their outward morality or heritage would exempt them from judgment. However, Paul makes it clear: God’s judgment is fair and applies to everyone.<br><br>

            This principle aligns with Jesus’ own teaching in Matthew:<br><br>

            <i><b>Matthew 16:27 ESV</b><br>
            For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done. </i><br><br>

            This does not mean that people earn their salvation through good works. Rather, God’s judgment considers the entirety of a person’s life, and their deeds reflect whether they have truly been transformed by faith.<br><br>

            <b>The Difference Between Judgment and Salvation</b><br><br>

            Paul makes an important distinction between judgment based on works and salvation based on grace. </p>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Judgment is based by Works</b> <br><br>

                    <i><b>Romans 2:6 ESV</b><br>
                    He will render to each one according to his works: <br><br>

                    <b>2 Corinthians 5:10 ESV</b><br>
                    For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil. <br><br>

                    <b>Romans 14:10-12 ESV</b><br>
                    <sup>10</sup> Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; <sup>11</sup> for it is written, “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.” <sup>12</sup> So then each of us will give an account of himself to God. </i><br><br>

                    a. Every person will stand before God and be held accountable for their actions.<br><br>

                    b. Our deeds will demonstrate whether we lived in obedience to God or rejected Him.<br><br>
        
                    c. When a person dies, their soul will stand before the Throne of God. Those deemed worthy will receive the reward of life in Paradise—a gift from Christ—and will take part in His 1,000-year reign on Earth. Ultimately, they will attain eternal life in the New Heaven and New Earth.<br><br>

                    Meanwhile, those considered unworthy will suffer in Hades and, eventually, in the Lake of Fire as punishment for their deeds on Earth, resulting in eternal separation from God. 
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Salvation is based by Grace</b> <br><br>

                    <i><b>Ephesians 2:8-9 ESV</b><br>
                    <sup>8</sup> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, <sup>9</sup> not a result of works, so that no one may boast. <br><br>
        
                    <b>Romans 3:23-24 ESV</b><br>
                    <sup>23</sup> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, <sup>24</sup> and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, </i><br><br>
        
                    a. No one can be saved by good deeds alone because all have sinned.<br><br>
        
                    b. The only way to receive eternal life is through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>

                    c. True faith in Christ is demonstrated through genuine repentance.


                </li>
            </ol><br>

            <p>
            If salvation were based solely on good works, no one would be saved because all have fallen short of God's perfect standard (Romans 3:23). Instead, salvation comes through grace, but true faith will always produce good works as evidence.<br><br>

            <i><b>James 2:17 ESV</b><br>
            So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</i><br><br>

            <i><b>John 15:5 ESV</b><br>
            I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. </i><br><br>

            <b>A Warning Against Hypocrisy</b><br><br>

            Paul's message is especially directed at those who assume they are exempt from judgment because of their religious background. Many Jews of Paul’s time believed that being God’s chosen people meant they were automatically saved, regardless of their personal righteousness. Paul dismantles this false security, stating that God judges everyone fairly—not by religious status, but by their response to His truth.<br><br>

            Similarly, today, many people assume that being part of a church or doing good things occasionally is enough. However, God looks at the heart. True faith in Christ is reflected in a life transformed by His grace.<br><br>

            <b>Conclusion: Faith That Produces Good Works</b><br><br>

            Romans 2:6 reminds us of a fundamental truth: God is just, and He will judge each person according to their deeds. However, this does not mean salvation is based on works. Instead:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Everyone will be held accountable for their actions.</li><br>
                <li>Good works do not earn salvation but are evidence of genuine faith.</li><br>
                <li>Salvation comes only through faith in Jesus Christ.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
            Paul’s ultimate point is that no one can rely on their own righteousness. Instead, we must humbly repent, trust in Christ, and allow His grace to transform our lives. Those who have true faith will naturally produce good works, not to earn salvation, but as a reflection of their relationship with God.
