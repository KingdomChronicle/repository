        <h2>Romans 2:3</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NASB (New American Standard Bible)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>3</sup>But do you suppose this, you foolish person who passes judgment on those who practice such things, and yet does them as well, that you will escape the judgment of God?

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Inescapable Judgment of God</b></p>

        <p> 
          This verse challenges a common but dangerous assumption: that certain people are exempt from God's judgment. Paul had previously condemned the sinful behaviors of the Gentiles in Romans 1, making it clear that those who reject God and live in sin will face His judgment. However, in Romans 2, he turns his attention to those who think they are morally superiorâ€”particularly the Jews of his time, who may have believed that their heritage or religious status would shield them from God's wrath. <br><br>

          <b>The Danger of Self-Righteousness</b><br><br>

          Paul's question exposes the hypocrisy of those who judge others for their sins while committing the same offenses. This warning is not just for the Jews of Paul's day but for anyone who assumes that their religious affiliation, moral knowledge, or good works will exempt them from God's judgment. Many people today fall into this trap, believing that being part of a church or religious group guarantees their righteousness. However, Paul makes it clear: no one escapes God's judgment simply because of their identity or knowledge.<br><br>

          <b>God's Impartial Judgment</b><br><br>

          God's judgment is fair and applies to all people, regardless of background. Paul later reinforces this in Romans 3:23, stating that "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." This universal guilt means that no one can claim innocence before a holy God. The self-righteous person who condemns others while committing the same sins will be held accountable just as much as the openly sinful individual.<br><br>

          <b>The Only Path to Salvation</b><br><br>

          The main theme of Paul's letter to the Romans is that salvation comes not through works, heritage, or religious affiliation but through faith in Christ alone. No one can escape God's judgment through self-righteousness. Instead, the only way to be justified before God is through His grace, received by faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>


          <i><b>Romans 3:24 ESV</b><br>
          and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, </i><br><br>

          <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>

          Romans 2:3 serves as a powerful reminder that God's judgment is inescapable for all who practice sin, regardless of their background or beliefs. It challenges us to examine our own hearts and recognize that true righteousness does not come from judging others or relying on religious identity but from humbly accepting God's grace through faith in Christ. Rather than assuming we are exempt from judgment, we should seek genuine transformation through a relationship with God, embracing His mercy and righteousness.
