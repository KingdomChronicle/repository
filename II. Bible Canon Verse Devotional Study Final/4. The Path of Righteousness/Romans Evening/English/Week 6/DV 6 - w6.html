        <h2>Romans 2:7</h2>
        <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>
          

        <p>
            <sup>7</sup>To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.

        <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

        <p class="chapterTitle"><b>The Evidence of True Salvation</b></p>

        <p> 
            This verse highlights an essential truth: doing good is not the way to earn salvation, but rather the result of a heart that has already been transformed by God. A person who has truly received salvation will naturally desire to do good, not out of obligation, but out of joy and love for God. <br><br>

            <b>Doing Good as the Fruit of Salvation</b><br><br>

            When we experience true salvation, our lives change. We no longer see doing good as a burden, but as a privilege and a natural response to the grace we have received. Good works become the outward sign of an inward transformation. Just as a healthy tree bears good fruit, a believer who is genuinely saved will display the goodness of God through their actions.<br><br>

            <i><b>Matthew 7:17-18 ESV</b><br>
            <sup>17</sup> So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. <sup>18</sup> A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. </i><br><br>

            This means that attending the gatherings of true Believers, serving in a ministry, supporting God’s work—especially in carrying the mission to spread His Kingdom on Earth—and living according to His will should not feel like a forced duty. Instead, it should bring joy, as it is an expression of our love and gratitude for what Christ has done for us. The desire to serve and do good should flow naturally from a heart transformed by the Holy Spirit.<br><br>

            <b>Self-Examination: Are We Truly in God's Kingdom?</b><br><br>

            However, if doing good continues to be a challenge for us—if we do not find joy in fellowshipping with the family of those who are already part of His Kingdom, serving, or participating in God’s work—especially in spreading His Kingdom on Earth, which has the power to transform broken systems and put an end to violence and corruption in our nation and the world.<br><br>

            This may be a sign that we have not truly received salvation and are not yet part of God’s Kingdom.<br><br>
            
            The Bible challenges us to examine ourselves to determine whether we are truly in the faith.<br><br>

            <i><b>2 Corinthians 13:5 NLT</b><br>
            Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves. Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith. 
            </i><br><br>

            Are we seeking to be part of God's Kingdom only because we fear hell, or because we genuinely love and desire to serve Him?<br><br>

            True salvation is not just about avoiding punishment; it is about being transformed into a new creation in Christ. <br><br>

            <i><b>2 Corinthians 5:17 ESV</b><br>
            Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. </i><br><br>

            A heart that has been truly changed by God will naturally seek to glorify Him through good works, not as a means of earning salvation, but as evidence that salvation has already taken place.<br><br>

            <b>The Mark of a Transformed Life</b><br><br>

            If our actions—our willingness to help, serve, and support God's work—are done out of love and joy, then they serve as proof that we are truly part of His Kingdom. When we find delight in doing good, it is a sign that God's Spirit is working in us. As Philippians 2:13 states, <br><br>

            <i><b>Philippians 2:13 NLT</b><br>
            For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him.</i><br><br>

            Salvation is not about forcing ourselves to do good but allowing God to change us from the inside out. A heart that belongs to Christ will always seek to do good joyfully, knowing that it is a reflection of the eternal life we have already received.<br><br>

            <b>Conclusion</b><br><br>

            Romans 2:7 emphasizes that persistent good works are the result of salvation, not the means to obtain it. Those who truly belong to God’s Kingdom will naturally desire to honor Him through their actions. If serving God and doing good feels like a burden, it is essential to examine whether we have genuinely surrendered our hearts to Him. Those who claim to be saved but find no joy in serving God should take this as a warning—good works alone cannot save anyone if they remain separated from God. True salvation brings a deep joy in serving Him, and when we experience this joy, we can confidently know that we are part of His eternal Kingdom.
