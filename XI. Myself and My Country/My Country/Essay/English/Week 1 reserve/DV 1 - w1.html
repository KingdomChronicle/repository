        <p class="SCQoute"><b>The Daily Devotional and Reflection Program:</b><br>"Me, Myself, and My Beloved Country" is a 24-day challenge to know and love both myself and my country. It is a personal growth journey designed to help us discover our true identity—as God’s masterpiece and as proud Filipinos. This program aims to deepen our understanding of who we are, nurture a strong sense of national identity, and awaken within us a genuine love and care for our homeland. Through daily reflection, we are trained to grow spiritually, emotionally, and patriotically—for the glory of God and the good of our nation.</p></p>

            <ul style=" color: #913a3a;">
              <li>Read with both heart and mind. Take time to read the message slowly and thoughtfully. Feel every word, and seek to understand the author’s intent. What truth is being revealed to you?</li>
              <li>Identify the central message. What is the main theme of the message? What reality is it trying to awaken us to? Recognize the call to action—and to whom it is being addressed.</li>
              <li>Reflect on the historical context. Use the historical references in the message as a mirror to examine our nation’s present state. What aspects of our society have remained the same? What lessons can we learn?</li>
              <li>Recognize the emotions expressed. Feel the sorrow, frustration, hope, and urgency conveyed in each paragraph. This is not just literary content—it is the cry of a patriotic heart.</li>
              <li>Write your personal reflection. What struck you the most? Was there a part of the message that deeply resonated with you? Write a short reflective paragraph expressing your thoughts and feelings and share it on our community chat.</li>
              <li>Take concrete actions to show love for the nation. What can you do today in response to the message’s call? Start small—with honesty, respect, discipline, and helping others. True patriotism is measured by action.</li>
              <li>Keep the spirit of the message alive in daily life. Don’t let the message end with reading. Let it live on in your thoughts, your words, and most importantly, your actions.</li>
              <!-- <li>Share what you’ve learned with others. Pass on the message of the message to your family, friends, or community. You can do this through conversation, a social media post, or even a simple heartfelt talk.</li> -->
              <li>"Share your reflection in the community chat anytime between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM."</li>

            </center> 
 
            <br>
  
                <p>For many Filipinos, corruption has long been identified as the root cause of our country’s problems. Undeniably, its effects have been devastating—eroding public trust, misusing government funds, and stunting national progress. But beneath all these lies a deeper, often overlooked illness: a lack of true love for the Philippines. The absence of compassion, unity, and accountability among citizens has become a cancer slowly eating away at the soul of our nation. <br><br>

                We must not ignore corruption. However, if we only focus on that, we oversimplify a much more complex issue. Other nations have also experienced corruption, yet they managed to rise again—because of their people’s love and commitment to their homeland.<br><br>

                Take South Korea, for example. Their progress was not just driven by economic reforms, but by strong nationalism and a collective will to rebuild the country even during extreme hardship. Citizens made sacrifices for the greater good.<br><br>

                In contrast, in the Philippines, the concept of the common good is gradually fading. Attitudes such as fatalism (“bahala na”), crab mentality, and indifference reflect a deeper lack of love for our country. It is seen in the simplest actions—throwing trash into rivers and streets, ignoring traffic laws, resorting to bribery, and showing little concern for others. These are not merely legal violations; they reveal a deeper failure to care for our nation.<br><br>

                This was not always the case. In the works of Dr. José Rizal, we see deep love for the motherland. In Noli Me Tangere, he didn’t just expose colonial abuses—he challenged every Filipino to awaken, to love, and to act for the future of the country. He wrote, “He who does not love his own language is worse than a beast and a stinking fish.”<br><br>

                Similarly, Apolinario Mabini, the “Brains of the Revolution,” believed that true freedom depends not only on intelligence, but also on love for others and the nation. In The True Decalogue, he emphasized the moral and civic duties of every citizen—lessons we seem to have forgotten today.<br><br>

                In the present day, news and personal stories reflect a diminishing love for the country. Consider the failed rehabilitation of the Pasig River. Despite billions in funding, the river remains polluted because residents and businesses continue to dump waste into it. This is not just an environmental issue—it is a painful example of our lack of care for the nation’s natural treasures.<br><br>

                On blogs and social media, many young Filipinos express a desire to leave the country for good—citing crime, hopelessness, and lack of opportunity. These frustrations are valid and real. But they also reveal how our sense of patriotism is fading.<br><br>

                In 2022, a missionary visited New Bilibid Prison and wrote in his blog how several inmates said they wanted to leave the country after their release, instead of rebuilding their lives and contributing to positive change. How can we expect national healing when even our own people have lost faith in their homeland?<br><br>

                In a country where about 80% of the population is Christian, one would expect love to prevail. Yet despite churches being full every Sunday, compassion for the poor, for society, and for the nation often falls short. As Scripture says, “Faith without works is dead” (James 2:26). The same applies to nationalism—love for the flag is meaningless if we cheat, break the law, and ignore the needs of others.<br><br>

                True love for the country is not a feeling—it is sacrifice, action, and conviction.<br><br>

                The future lies in the hands of the next generation. But if our youth are raised to be selfish, cynical, and indifferent, the crisis will only deepen. That’s why parents, teachers, faith leaders, and influencers must play a vital role in shaping patriotic hearts.<br><br>

                In a blog titled “Teach the Children to Love the Philippines” (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2021), a teacher once asked her class, “Why do you love the Philippines?” Most students were silent. Only a few said, “Because I live here.” The teacher realized that it is not enough to simply live in the country—we must be taught, and we must live out, what it means to love our nation every day.<br><br>

                We need a new generation of Filipinos who do not merely complain but serve; who do not blame, but build; who do not run away, but sacrifice.<br><br>

                Jesus taught, “Whatever you did for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” In the Philippines, the “least” are all around us—children on the streets, farmers, prisoners, teachers, workers. Loving God cannot be separated from loving them. And loving them is loving our country.<br><br>

                It is not enough to elect good leaders or hope for reforms. If the hearts of Filipinos do not change, the wounds of our nation will remain open. We must reignite the fire of love—from every family, every barangay, every citizen.<br><br>

                Let us choose to love. Let us start with simple acts of care. Let us invite others into this movement of renewal. Let us serve not out of obligation, but because we believe the Philippines is worth loving.<br><br>

                In the end, it is not politics that will save us, but people who truly love their country and their God.
