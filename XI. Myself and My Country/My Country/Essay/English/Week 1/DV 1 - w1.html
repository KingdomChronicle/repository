            <ul style=" color: #913a3a;">
              <li>Read with both heart and mind. Take time to read the message slowly and thoughtfully. Feel every word, and seek to understand the author’s intent. What truth is being revealed to you?</li>
              <li>Identify the central message. What is the main theme of the message? What reality is it trying to awaken us to? Recognize the call to action—and to whom it is being addressed.</li>
              <li>Reflect on the historical context. Use the historical references in the message as a mirror to examine our nation’s present state. What aspects of our society have remained the same? What lessons can we learn?</li>
              <li>Recognize the emotions expressed. Feel the sorrow, frustration, hope, and urgency conveyed in each paragraph. This is not just literary content—it is the cry of a patriotic heart.</li>
              <li>Write your personal reflection. What struck you the most? Was there a part of the message that deeply resonated with you? Write a short reflective paragraph expressing your thoughts and feelings and share it on our community chat.</li>
              <li>Take concrete actions to show love for the nation. What can you do today in response to the message’s call? Start small—with honesty, respect, discipline, and helping others. True patriotism is measured by action.</li>
              <li>Keep the spirit of the message alive in daily life. Don’t let the message end with reading. Let it live on in your thoughts, your words, and most importantly, your actions.</li>
              <!-- <li>Share what you’ve learned with others. Pass on the message of the message to your family, friends, or community. You can do this through conversation, a social media post, or even a simple heartfelt talk.</li> -->
              <li>"Share your reflection in the community chat anytime between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM."</li>

            <br>
  
                <p>Understanding history is essential if we are to grasp how our identity as Filipinos was shaped. But more important than mere knowledge is the awakening to painful truths—truths that have been denied, abandoned, and continually ignored. In the history of the word “Filipino,” we find the evolving nature of our identity, and how the world—and often our fellow countrymen—have viewed and continue to view our race. <br><br>

                From 1542 to 1877, the term “Filipino” referred only to Spaniards born in the Philippines. We, the natives, were reduced to the term “Indio”—a label rooted in colonial discrimination and condescension. A foreign system of oppression molded our servitude—not just physically, but mentally and spiritually.<br><br>

                Then came Dr. José Rizal—a brilliant, patriotic, and visionary son of the nation. Through his writings, he was the first to use the word “Filipino” to refer to the native people. In that simple yet revolutionary act, he restored dignity to our name and honor to our identity.<br><br>

                But where are we now?<br><br>

                In 1998, a Greek dictionary defined “Filipina” as a domestic helper. In Europe, “Filipinos” became a brand of biscuits. In a resort in Boracay, a foreigner was heard yelling, “Hey monkey, come here!” to a Filipina waitress—and instead of standing her ground, she quietly obeyed.<br><br>

                Worse still, if we look back to the time of the Japanese occupation, parents would go to great lengths to hide their daughters, fearful they might be taken and violated. But today, it must be said with painful honesty: there are parents who willingly offer their daughters to foreigners—Japanese, Americans, and other tourists—for the sake of money. In exchange for quick profit, the purity and future of the Filipina youth are sacrificed.<br><br>

                It is tragic but true—our image as a people seems even more degraded now than during colonization. Once upon a time, Filipino scholars in Europe were hailed as the “glory of the universities.” Today, our education and dignity are buried under layers of poverty, corruption, and a deeply-rooted inferiority complex.<br><br>

                In the powerful essay “Why We Are Poor” by F. Sionil José, he recalls the 1950s and '60s—a time when the Philippines was the envy of Southeast Asia. We led the region in progress and potential. Today, we find ourselves listed among the poorest nations, alongside Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. What happened?<br><br>

                Is it not true that we Filipinos played the biggest role in our own downfall—through negligence, corruption, apathy, and a lack of genuine love for the nation?<br><br>

                This is a call to every Filipino: wake up to the truth. We cannot change the past, but we can correct the direction of our future. We don’t need to wait for our dignity to be trampled again to realize the value of being Filipino. True patriotism isn’t just shouted in the streets—it’s lived out through integrity, discipline, honor, and compassion for one another.<br><br>

                The Philippines is not a weak nation. We were made weak by our own silence, our surrender to a broken system. But there is still hope—if we unite under one cause: to love this nation in thought, in word, and in deed.<br><br>

                Let us not pass on to the next generation a broken, fragile, enslaved nation. It is our duty to repair the path—beginning now.<br><br>

                Our name bears history.<br>
                Our race holds honor.<br>
                Our identity carries worth.<br><br>

                The Philippines is ours—let us love it, fight for it, and uplift it with all our hearts.
