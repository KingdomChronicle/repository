            <h2 style="color: rgb(38, 114, 23);">“Awakening: <br> A Call to a Nation That Has Forgotten Itself”</h2>
            </center> 
 
            <br>
  
               <p>
                There are times when silence is no longer humility—but betrayal. When stillness is not a sign of peace, but of forgetting. <br>
                And forgetting becomes the quiet surrender of our dignity. <br><br>

                This is that time.<br>
                This is the moment to awaken—not just to see the light,<br>
                but to remember who we truly are. <br><br>

                In the midst of noise and lies, in the echo of collective amnesia,
                our identity has been slowly erased.<br>
                Like waves crashing endlessly upon the shore, time has swallowed the memory of our origins. <br><br>

                But now, a new wave rises—<br>
                not to destroy, but to rebuild.<br>
                Not to deceive, but to reveal the truth.<br><br>

                For far too long, the true face of the Philippines has been hidden.<br>
                What the world has seen is a portrait crafted by those who enslaved and betrayed us—a picture full of weakness and hopelessness.<br>
                We have accepted that image as reality, until we forgot:<br> <br>

                That is not who we are.<br><br>

                But here is the truth:  <br><br>

                We are not cursed—we are chosen.  <br>
                We are not abandoned—we are destined.  <br>
                And we are not defeated—we are destined to rise and lead.<br><br>

                We are a nation forged in fire, tested by history, and sealed with divine purpose. Our story is not finished—this is just the true beginning—the start of the greatest chapter in our history.<br><br>

                And so this is a call—<br>
                Not merely to stand, but to return to our roots, to awaken the memory of our ancestors, and to restore the dignity that was once stolen from us.  <br><br>

                We have not lost our ability—we have lost our memory.<br><br>

                And with the loss of memory, the nation has lost its way. It no longer understands the true value of its actions:<br><br>

                We celebrate heroes, yet forget the values they fought for.  <br><br>

                We wave our flag, yet feel ashamed of who we are. <br><br>
                
                We build churches, yet our conscience, spirit, and soul remain asleep. <br><br>

                We cry for justice in the streets and on social media, yet neglect integrity in private life.<br><br>

                Now is the time to change the narrative.<br><br>

                If some are still asleep—let us wake them.<br>
                If shame still lingers—let us restore our honor.<br>
                If fear grips us—let us replace it with courage.<br>
                And if silence prevails—let us raise the voice of truth.<br><br>

                Because we are not Filipinos by blood alone—<br>
                We are Filipinos by destiny.<br><br>

                Like Nehemiah, we are the generation called to rebuild our broken walls—<br>
                Not driven by anger, but by purpose.<br>
                Not for selfish gain, but for the future of our nation.<br><br>

                <i>“But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession...”</i> —<b>1 Peter 2:9</b><br><br>

                So we rise—not because it is easy, but because it is right.<br>
                We fight—not out of hate, but out of hope.<br>
                We rebuild—not as perfect, but as chosen bearers of goodness.<br><br>

                And I say this with full conviction:<br>
                There are still heroes in this land.<br>
                And you— <br>
                you are one of them.<br><br>

                <b>Final Call to the Spirit Within the Filipino</b><br><br>
                
                But what is the purpose of awakening if we remain bound by the chains of inaction?<br><br>

                What good is light if we still choose to live in the shadow of lies?<br><br>

                And what is the worth of truth if it fails to bring genuine transformation rooted in faith and love for our nation?<br><br>

                The truth has been revealed—it can no longer be denied.<br><br>

                Heaven has declared our identity—it can no longer be postponed.<br><br>

                And the call of this generation is no longer a whisper—<br><br>

                It is a thunderous drumbeat echoing in the rhythm of our hearts throughout the nation,<br><br>

                Calling us to rise, to act, and to rebuild a nation that once knelt in the annals of history.<br><br>

                Now is the time. This is the defining moment to ask ourselves:<br><br>

                What will be my response to the cry of my Motherland?<br><br>

                It is no longer enough to watch silently. <br>
                It is no longer enough to shout into the void of social media without action.<br>
                This is the hour for bold and courageous action. <br>
                This is the moment for unwavering conviction.<br><br>

                Let us bring every Filipino into this journey—and allow their spirits to awaken, just as God awakened those who came before us.<br><br>

                Rise, my fellow Filipino—<br>
                Not to seek comfort, but to embrace your calling.<br>
                Not to hide the wounds of the past, but to prove we have been forged in the fire of our trials.<br><br>

                You are part of this unfolding story.<br>
                You are the fulfillment of our ancestors’ prayers.  <br>
                And you are the seed of hope for the generations yet to come.<br><br>

                <b>A Chosen Nation Must Begin to Remember</b><br><br>

                I want to end this with a profound truth—  <br>
                But from this truth, a new beginning is born.<br><br>

                <b>First,</b> we must fully reclaim our true identity.<br>
                This begins with rediscovering our roots—<br>
                By bringing back the essence of our history,<br>
                And recognizing ourselves as a chosen people,<br>
                Ordained by God for this season of awakening and fulfillment.<br><br>

                <b>Second,</b> we must come to truly know the God who has chosen us. <br>
                Not simply in name, but in truth and in living relationship. <br><br>

                As we walk daily in His Word, clarity unfolds—<br>
                Not only about who He is,<br>
                But about who we are in Him.<br><br>

                <i>“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.”</i>
                —<b>John 8:32</b><br><br>

                Fellow countrymen, this is the only path to restoring our true national identity. <br>
                We are not merely a people of potential—<br>
                We are a people with a prophetic purpose.<br>
                We were not merely survivors of history—<br>
                We were chosen to fulfill a great and divine destiny.<br><br>

                If this is the only way to truly rediscover ourselves,<br>  
                I humbly and earnestly call on you: <br>
                Let us learn, ask questions, and awaken together through this program and remarkable journey.  <br>
                For its purpose is not just knowledge but the restoration of our identity.<br>
                Its purpose is to prepare us, as a chosen people, to rise again and rebuild our beloved Country.<br><br>

                Let us uncover the truths that have long been hidden from us.<br>
                Because here, in the light of truth,<br>
                There is no room for betrayal or deception.<br><br>

                We shall no longer be misled—because this truth will light the path to our true revival and freedom from the grip of lies.<br><br>

                Together, let us seek the truth of our identity.  <br>
                Let us dare to ask the difficult questions—  <br>
                Questions that shallow thinking cannot answer,<br>
                But which open the gates to the great awakening of the spirit of our noble race.<br><br>

                For if we, once mistaken for helpless chicks—<br>
                Awaken to the light of truth,<br>
                We shall soar as eagles,<br>
                Reaching the summits of the promises set before us.<br>
                We will overcome every storm, for the Lord Himself leads His chosen people. <br><br>
                <i>
                “But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength;  <br>
                They will soar high on wings like eagles.  <br>
                They will run and not grow weary.  <br>
                They will walk and not faint.”  <br></i>
                —<b>Isaiah 40:31</b><br><br>

                And together, with full strength and wholehearted devotion, we shall rebuild the God-chosen nation.<br><br>

                Remember this...<br><br>

                <b>You Are Chosen</b><br><br>

                You were not born a Filipino by chance.<br>
                The Filipino blood flows in you because you were divinely called.<br>
                You are forged by time, by wounds, and by prayer.  <br>
                But more than anything, you have been chosen by Heaven for such a time as this.<br><br>

                <b>So rise</b>—not because it is easy,  <br>
                But because it is right.<br><br>

                <b>Speak</b>—not because the world is guaranteed to listen,<br>
                But because truth must be heard.<br><br>

                <b>Lead</b>—not because you are perfect,  <br>
                But because God Himself has chosen you to be part of His grand design.<br><br>

                The age of forgetting is over.<br>
                The time of remembrance has come.<br><br>

                Heaven awaits our response.<br>
                This is the moment. This is the day. This is the call.<br><br>

                Let us rise. Let us move. Let us act.<br>
                And together, let us awaken a nation that once forgot—<br>
                But now remembers, and stands ready to respond to the call of its Creator.
