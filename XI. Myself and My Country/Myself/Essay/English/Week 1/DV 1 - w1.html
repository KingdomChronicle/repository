            <h1>Daily Devotional Verses and essay:</h1>
        </center>

        <p class="SCQoute">The Daily Devotional and Reflection Program: For Myself and My Country is a personal growth journey designed to help us discover our true identity—as God’s masterpiece and as proud Filipinos. It aims to deepen our understanding of who we are, cultivate a strong sense of national identity, and awaken within us a genuine love and care for our country. Through daily reflection, we are trained to grow spiritually, emotionally, and patriotically—for the glory of God and the good of our nation.</p>

        <p class="chapterTitle">Guidelines for Understanding and Living Out the Essay: “Awakening to Truth: A Call to Genuine Love for the Nation”</p>
            <ul style="color: red;">
              <li>Read with both heart and mind. Take time to read the essay slowly and thoughtfully. Feel every word, and seek to understand the author’s intent. What truth is being revealed to you?</li>
              <li>Identify the central message. What is the main theme of the essay? What reality is it trying to awaken us to? Recognize the call to action—and to whom it is being addressed.</li>
              <li>Reflect on the historical context. Use the historical references in the essay as a mirror to examine our nation’s present state. What aspects of our society have remained the same? What lessons can we learn?</li>
              <li>Recognize the emotions expressed. Feel the sorrow, frustration, hope, and urgency conveyed in each paragraph. This is not just literary content—it is the cry of a patriotic heart.</li>
              <li>Write your personal reflection. What struck you the most? Was there a part of the essay that deeply resonated with you? Write a short reflective paragraph expressing your thoughts and feelings.</li>
              <li>Share what you’ve learned with others. Pass on the message of the essay to your family, friends, or community. You can do this through conversation, a social media post, or even a simple heartfelt talk.</li>
              <li>Take concrete actions to show love for the nation. What can you do today in response to the essay’s call? Start small—with honesty, respect, discipline, and helping others. True patriotism is measured by action.</li>
              <li>Keep the spirit of the essay alive in daily life. Don’t let the message end with reading. Let it live on in your thoughts, your words, and most importantly, your actions.</li>
            </ul>

                <p class="chapterTitle">NIV (New International Version)</p>

                <p><sup>16</sup><b>All Scripture is God-breathed</b> and is <b>useful for teaching</b>, <b>rebuking</b>, <b>correcting</b> and <b>training in righteousness</b>,<sup>17</sup> <b>so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work</b>.</p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>
  
                <p><b>All Scripture is God's Breathed... </b> All scriptures originate from God and are inspired by the Holy Spirit. While some argue that they are merely written by humans, it is important to recognize that these humans were chosen by God and guided by the Holy Spirit. Scriptures were written to serve as instruction and guidance for humanity. </p> 

                <p><b>useful for teaching...</b> The Scripture is beneficial to those who read it, serving as God's way to teach and guide all whom He has called and chosen.</p>   
                 
                <p><b>useful for rebuking and correcting...</b> People have many customs, traditions, and practices that we might not be aware of, and these can be sinful acts against God. We can use the scriptures to correct the wrong practices we engage in during our daily lives.</p>

                    <ul><p><b>Sample of practices that God forbids</b></p>
                        <li>You shall not kill (Exodus 20:13)</li>
                        <li>You shall not steal (Exodus 20:15)</li>
                        <li>Gossip is  wrong (Proverbs 20:19)</li>
                        <li>Instruction on excessive eating (Proverbs 23:20-21)</li>
                        <li>Lesson about greed (Luke 12:15)</li>
                    </ul>
        
                <p><b>useful in  training in righteousness,</b> So, God wants us to always listen to, read, and meditate His words. This way, we can live a sensible life and stay safe both in our daily lives and after we die.</p>

                <p><b>so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.</b> This is a message for all servants of God or anyone who wants to become one. We are invited to stay connected to His Word so that we can always be ready to do good things in our daily lives.</p>
