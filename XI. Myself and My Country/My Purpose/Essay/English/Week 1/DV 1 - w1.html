                <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day</p>    

                <h2>Colossians 1:16</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>

                <p><sup>16</sup> For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him.</p>

                <br><hr>
                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p class="chapterTitle">DISCOVERING THE ORIGIN OF PURPOSE</p>

                <p class="chapterTitle">“It all Starts with God”</p>
  
                <p>In a world that constantly tells us to "follow your heart" and "create your own destiny," the quest for purpose has become deeply personal, yet often misguided. We search inward, trying to define ourselves by our passions, possessions, or professions. But what if the true origin of purpose is not found within, but beyond us? What if discovering our purpose requires first discovering our Creator? <br><br>

                As Rick Warren writes in The Purpose Driven Life, <br>
                <i>"You were made by God and for God—and until you understand that, life will never make sense."</i><br><br>

                This profound truth points us back to our foundational question:<br>
                Where does purpose begin?<br>
                The answer: It all starts with God.<br><br>

                The Apostle Paul affirms this in Colossians 1:16, saying:<br>
                <i>“For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible... all things have been created through Him and for Him.”</i><br><br>

                This verse dismantles the popular belief that we are the authors of our own purpose. It reveals that we are not the center of the universe, but part of a grand design authored by God Himself. <br><br>

                Imagine a painter creating a masterpiece. The painting does not determine its purpose—the artist does. In the same way, we, as God’s creation, do not create our own purpose; we uncover it by knowing our Creator. The more we understand His heart, the more we understand who we are and what we’re here for. <br><br>

                Philosopher and theologian Augustine once said,<br>
                <i>"You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You."</i> <br><br>

                This restlessness is familiar to many—a feeling of emptiness even after achieving success, accumulating wealth, or chasing dreams. That ache within us is not a flaw; it’s a longing for the One who made us. <br><br>

                When we begin with God, everything else falls into place. Purpose is no longer about performance, achievement, or recognition. It becomes about alignment—walking in step with the One who designed us with intention. <br><br>

                Too often, young people ask, “What should I do with my life?” <br>
                But the more powerful question is,<br>
                <i>“Lord, what do You want to do through my life?”</i><br><br>
                When we ask this, we are not giving up our individuality—we are fulfilling it in its highest form. <br><br>

                The great missionary William Carey once declared,<br>
                <i>"Expect great things from God; attempt great things for God."</i><br><br>

                Carey understood that discovering purpose means living in bold partnership with God’s will. Purpose is not passive; it demands response, action, and surrender.<br><br>

                Yet surrender is not loss.<br>
                It is the beginning of true freedom.<br>
                When we stop trying to write our own story apart from God, we finally find our place in His eternal story.<br><br>

                So today, if you are searching for meaning, stop looking within and start looking above. Begin where everything begins—with God. Because until you know Him, you will never fully know yourself.<br><br>

                And when you do, you’ll realize that your life is not an accident. It is a calling.<br><br>

                Conclusion: <br><br>

                At the end of the day, the longing for purpose is not just a philosophical matter—it is something deeply personal. It’s the silent question we carry in the quiet moments of the night:<br><br>

                “Is this all there is to life?”<br><br>

                You may be surrounded by achievements, friendships, recognition, and even comfort.<br>
                But let me ask you:<br>
                Are you truly happy with the direction your life is going?<br>
                Do you feel a sense of peace in your heart, or do you feel that something is missing—like no matter what you do, it’s still not enough?<br><br>

                Could it be that what’s missing is not something, but His presence? Could it be that your soul is searching for its true Source?<br><br>

                C.S. Lewis once said:<br>
                <i>"If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world."</i> <br><br>

                The truth is, you were made for God, and your life will only make sense in Him. Your purpose is not found in what you do, but in who designed you—and why.<br><br>

                So here is a challenge for you:<br>
                Will you keep chasing after temporary things that leave you empty?<br><br>

                Or will you return to your true foundation—your Creator—and discover the purpose that only He can reveal?<br><br>

                Today,<br>
                God is calling you back to the origin of all purpose: <br><br>
                
                God Himself.<br><br>

                The question is not just,<br>
                “What am I here for?”<br>
                The real question is:<br>
                “Am I ready to live for the One who created me?”<br><br>

                Because your life…<br>
                was never meant to be random. It was meant to reflect the glory of the One who made you—on purpose, for a purpose.

          A Short Prayer: <br><br>

          You may pause for a moment and gently close your eyes. Then, ask your Creator this simple prayer:<br><br>

          <i>
          "God, my Creator, I want to know You more. Please show me Your purpose for my life, so I may honor You with the life You have entrusted to me."</i>
